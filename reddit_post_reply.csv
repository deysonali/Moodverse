"Depression for me is a constant feeling of wanting to go home, but no matter where I am, I am never home. Even when I‚Äôm at my physical home.",9091,cpidz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cpidz8/depression_for_me_is_a_constant_feeling_of/,"It‚Äôs a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else. I‚Äôd feel better if i was at this place. Then you go there and then it‚Äôs the same exact feeling, just in a different physical location. 

I feel mentally homeless and I just want to go home.


Edit: I didn‚Äôt think this would get traction and that‚Äôs my first gold. Thanks buddy.",That's a good description of it. Good luck on your journey.
Depression is so much worse if you live with your parents.,7752,c2fuf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c2fuf3/depression_is_so_much_worse_if_you_live_with_your/,"I can't hide, I can't cry out loud, they don't understand me if I can't clean my room or can't go out. They watch me fall apart and criticise me while it happens.","This is so true. Its especially true in my culture as an asian because depression is thought of as taboo. Having a child with depression makes them think its the absolute end of the world, that they‚Äôve got a ruined child and they‚Äôve failed in raising me as my parent. 

Its not their fault, but with that mentality we cant share the feelings we have with people who we should feel most safe to talk about our emotions openly, without further feeling like a burden to the whole family. Then that shit spreads like wildfire through the family members ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Shout out to the particular hell that is functional depression.,6614,cd0hjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cd0hjp/shout_out_to_the_particular_hell_that_is/,"This is me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs better than don‚Äôt-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. I am grateful I can be an independent person. But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that‚Äôs it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time.","I know how you feel. I feel sad and hopeless most of the time, but I always manage to go to work. I guess as hard as it is when I wake up, once I‚Äôm there I feel somewhat better."
A stranger just saved my life...,5947,7k1nt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7k1nt2/a_stranger_just_saved_my_life/,"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 ","I‚Äôm going to buy someone a hot chocolate today and say something similar, 

;hugs!"
I was going to kill myself tonight,5154,bsrdr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsrdr0/i_was_going_to_kill_myself_tonight/,"I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my ‚Äúlast meal‚Äù while listening to Bob Marley.

About an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We‚Äôre planning on playing tomorrow too.

I don‚Äôt feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn‚Äôt kill myself.

Edit: thank you for the gold, friend:)

Edit: thank you for the silver, friend:) I‚Äôm currently sitting at a coffee shop, reading all the kind messages everyone has sent. It means a lot to me","Fuck, you gave me goosebumps . <3"
"Does anyone ever feel okay for a while, then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck?",5059,b7fxrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b7fxrm/does_anyone_ever_feel_okay_for_a_while_then_a/,"Recently I thought I was beginning to feel better. Not quite happy, but just sort of... I don‚Äôt know, content? But my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. This has happened in the past too. I‚Äôm worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i‚Äôm hanging onto will snap. Or maybe not. That could just be the apathy speaking though. Anybody else really frustrated by this? It feels like i‚Äôm always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. Ugh. 

Edit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. I just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. It makes things less lonely.","Yes it feels like the calm before the hurricane. Some times i feel like my brain has a bucket when he keeps the serotonin, when theres a happy moment he says like ""YES HAPPY MOMENT"" *dumps the whole bucket*, but the next day as my brain spent all the serotonin for the week in the other happy moment theres no more serotonin left.

"Living with depression is like running a marathon with a broken leg and then having everyone run past you and say ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, broken leg boo-hoo, we‚Äôre all tired.‚Äù And then run the same fucking race everyday. The cycle.",4755,ch5k91,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ch5k91/living_with_depression_is_like_running_a_marathon/,"You‚Äôre depressed!

You‚Äôre okay, it‚Äôll take time, but you‚Äôre okay!

What the hell is taking so long, life blows, you‚Äôre depressed again!

You woke up and got dressed today, it‚Äôs looking up from here?

SIKE, you fucking idiot, did you truly believe your depression was done with you? You‚Äôre dumber than you lead yourself to believe!

Okay, we‚Äôre okay, we‚Äôre gonna make it. I just gotta stay strong.

Oop, you fucked up once today, I‚Äôm dragging your ass back into the dark. 

OVER AND OVER AND OVER! 

Is there really only one way out? I don‚Äôt know if I wanna die, I got a brother who may need me one day. I‚Äôm tired. So tired, man.","To me it's more like I'm paraplegic and without a wheelchair. Someone dumped me at the start of a marathon, and everyone is yelling at me for ""not trying"". A couple of people approach me with ""helpful tips on how to run a marathon"", but when I tell them that I literally cannot move, they get mad and start yelling too. Then, those yelling people are saying that I am lazy, and that I want someone to carry me to the finish line. I'm trying to tell them I am not even interested in running their dumb race, so they call me lazy for not trying. Another group of people approach me with stories about how they used to be paraplegic, or they know someone who's paraplegic, who went on to win a gold medal in the Olympics. They show a picture and said person has an expensive motorized high tech wheelchair. I let them know I can't even afford a foldable lightweight wheelchair, so they look at me confused, then get mad, and then tell me I am not trying hard enough to get that expensive motorized high tech wheelchair. 

23 years of this bullshit. I am tired too man."
"If 10 years ago someone told me that in 10 years I would be routinely sitting in my room all day doing nothing to make myself a successful man but eat, sleep and use my phone/pc and sometimes go out for a lonely aimless walks, I would never believe them",4383,ccaxvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ccaxvm/if_10_years_ago_someone_told_me_that_in_10_years/,"But here I am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that.",I can't even remember my life ten years ago
"""Depression isn't always at 3am when you're alone with only the thoughts in your head. Sometimes it's at 3pm, when you're surrounded by friends in the middle of laughing."" This is high functioning depression. So many people don't get it.",4046,6436ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6436ul/depression_isnt_always_at_3am_when_youre_alone/,"I look normal on the outside, but that's because I try very hard to.",Yep. You might be able to see it if you know what you're looking for. Otherwise I look a little tired and I'm probably pretty quiet but I'm conversing and even laughing at the right parts. People don't realize how tiring keeping up appearances is or that while they're talking about the weather or work my mind is still on whether or not I'd die if I jumped off the parking garage.  
Does anyone else get extremely bummed out seeing people younger than them doing more with their life?,3901,c5j15l,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c5j15l/does_anyone_else_get_extremely_bummed_out_seeing/,"I hate being told: ""It'll get better when you're older."" No it fucking won't. I've waited for over a decade for things to get better & they haven't. It's especially not true when I see people younger than me living better, happier, & more interesting lives. Clearly that means I'm a failure & I just can't properly do this game we call life.

Just today someone I know who's younger than me just managed to find their own apartment with their SO. I can't do that now & if that doesn't scream that I'm a pathetic loser, I don't know what does.","Went out with someone who was 23 and is currently making twice as much as me doing a job that requires half the education I have. I felt like shit that I have a 4 year degree and nothing to show for it at 28 years old while people with 2 year degrees, sometimes even college drop outside, making much more money than me because they went into trade jobs. Now I'm just in debt with a worthless piece of paper. No real job skills."
