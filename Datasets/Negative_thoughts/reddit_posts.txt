depression for me is a constant feeling of wanting to go home, but no matter where i am, i am never home. even when i’m at my physical home.
it’s a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else. i’d feel better if i was at this place. then you go there and then it’s the same exact feeling, just in a different physical location. i feel mentally homeless and i just want to go home.edit: i didn’t think this would get traction and that’s my first gold. thanks buddy.
depression is so much worse if you live with your parents.
i can't hide, i can't cry out loud, they don't understand me if i can't clean my room or can't go out. they watch me fall apart and criticise me while it happens.
shout out to the particular hell that is functional depression.
this is me. don’t get me wrong, it’s better than don’t-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. i am grateful i can be an independent person. but there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that’s it. nothing else. no social life. no hobbies. constantly battling your mind. and being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time.
a stranger just saved my life...
i woke up today wanting to die. i was planning on doing it after school so i decided school was pointless to go to. i walked to the mall by my school and went to a kneader's and ordered french toast. french toast has always been my favorite so i figured it would be a good last thing to eat. i pondered a ton about my life and what it is i really want. i felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. i had convinced myself i needed to finish my life today. i had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. he said that he ordered it for me because he could tell i needed it. he told me i don't know what you're going through, but life will get better. and then he left. and then i cried. and now i'm back at school, and i think i want to live. edit: thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 
i was going to kill myself tonight
i wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. i spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. i ate my “last meal” while listening to bob marley.about an hour before i was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play xbox. we ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. it felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. we’re planning on playing tomorrow too.i don’t feel as bad as i did earlier today and i also am glad that i didn’t kill myself.edit: thank you for the gold, friend:)edit: thank you for the silver, friend:) i’m currently sitting at a coffee shop, reading all the kind messages everyone has sent. it means a lot to me
does anyone ever feel okay for a while, then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck?
recently i thought i was beginning to feel better. not quite happy, but just sort of... i don’t know, content? but my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. this has happened in the past too. i’m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i’m hanging onto will snap. or maybe not. that could just be the apathy speaking though. anybody else really frustrated by this? it feels like i’m always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. ugh. edit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. i just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. it makes things less lonely.
living with depression is like running a marathon with a broken leg and then having everyone run past you and say “yeah, yeah, broken leg boo-hoo, we’re all tired.” and then run the same fucking race everyday. the cycle.
you’re depressed!you’re okay, it’ll take time, but you’re okay!what the hell is taking so long, life blows, you’re depressed again!you woke up and got dressed today, it’s looking up from here?sike, you fucking idiot, did you truly believe your depression was done with you? you’re dumber than you lead yourself to believe!okay, we’re okay, we’re gonna make it. i just gotta stay strong.oop, you fucked up once today, i’m dragging your ass back into the dark. over and over and over! is there really only one way out? i don’t know if i wanna die, i got a brother who may need me one day. i’m tired. so tired, man.
if 10 years ago someone told me that in 10 years i would be routinely sitting in my room all day doing nothing to make myself a successful man but eat, sleep and use my phone/pc and sometimes go out for a lonely aimless walks, i would never believe them
but here i am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that.
depression isn't always at 3am when you're alone with only the thoughts in your head. sometimes it's at 3pm, when you're surrounded by friends in the middle of laughing. this is high functioning depression. so many people don't get it.
i look normal on the outside, but that's because i try very hard to.
does anyone else get extremely bummed out seeing people younger than them doing more with their life?
i hate being told: it'll get better when you're older. no it fucking won't. i've waited for over a decade for things to get better & they haven't. it's especially not true when i see people younger than me living better, happier, & more interesting lives. clearly that means i'm a failure & i just can't properly do this game we call life.just today someone i know who's younger than me just managed to find their own apartment with their so. i can't do that now & if that doesn't scream that i'm a pathetic loser, i don't know what does.
i want to be alone, but not lonely. i want friends but hate socializing. want success, but have no desire to be productive. i’m lost in my own conscience.
thank you all for the supportive messages. it’s heartwarming to know that i’m not alone. i know we can all get through this together. i love each and every single one of you 
does anyone else stay up super late to avoid the next day?
i don’t know if that makes sense. what i mean is that i stay up as late as possible wasting time because i know that if i go to sleep, i’ll wake up and have to go to school. i usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it’s destroying me, i’ve been doing this for months and i’m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it. and they always seem to get their way. edit: i’m really glad that this spoke to so many people, it feels good knowing i’m not alone. sending lots of love to you all. this isn’t easy but i believe in you ❤️
i wouldn't commit suicide but if i had an option to suddenly stop existing i would choose it
does anyone else feel this way?  this has been crossing my mind a lot latelyedit: i just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments i've been recieving.  it's been a nice change and i really appreciate it.  you guys are the best.  :)
had anyone noticed memory decline from depression?
just curious if anyone else affected by this problem also noticed quite a big cognitive decline. or if anyone has noticed a cognitive decline and managed to build themselves back up to that previous cognitive level.
high-functioning depression: i feel like i'm living a double life.
i read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. i feel that i am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.from an outsider's perspective, i appear to be a very happy and stable individual. i have a financially secure job and i go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. my coworkers like me, and some look up to me. no one would think i have any problems at all. however, i feel like i am hidden behind a veil, and when i come home from work and when i am in the privacy of my home, i am in such crippling depression. i have such terrible episodes of sadness. i hate myself. i over-analyze everything stupid i do or say throughout the day and i replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. i don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. and yet i still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like i am okay. it feels like i am living a double life that i cannot escape.
does anyone else feel normal one minute then wish you were dead the next?
i feel decent. i'm watching youtube or i'm just browsing the internet and all of a sudden my mind is like: everything in life requires effort and i'm way too exhausted to try. i have a long life ahead of me but it's too much of a bother. i don't want to live.even if i'm feeling optimistic about my future and, what if everything really does work out the way i want it to? i feel like it's way too tiring to live the life i want and all i want is to sleep and do nothing.everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and i don't want to do it. i think if i knew that i would inevitably drop dead in 10 years then i would feel a bit more motivated, but just knowing that it's likely that i'll have to wait 50 more fucking years before i might finally drop dead is like a giant weight on my shoulders.
i cried in front of my family today. they ended up comparing their issues to mine and tell me that other people have it worse.
thank you, that really helps. now i feel ten times worse.
does anyone else have a constant feeling of not fitting in or belonging anywhere?
i feel this way around everyone, friends, family, coworkers, anywhere i go. i just always feel like i’m in the background. but at the same time i like going unnoticed so i don’t have to talk to anyone and be in the spotlight..
my therapist died
she was only 67. she told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, i don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.i'm extremely shaken up, but i think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.in her memory i'm going to tell the people i love how i feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when i feel like nobody else is.edit: thanks everyone for your kind words, i feel less alone about this now. in lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further
do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever you're doing and feel a great wave of existential dread/self-hatred
happens to me a lot. cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes i just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened.
the worst part of depression is waking up and the first thought that pops in your head is how shitty you feel, alone and already struggling to get through the day before it’s even started.
i can’t even remember the last time i woke up excited for anything.edit: wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and sharing your own stories. definitely glad to have this community it helps to know we aren’t alone even though it may feel that way.
does anyone have a period where they feel really motivated and see things clearly, only to crash even harder the more you try to better yourself, feeling even more depressed than you were originally?
it feels like the harder i try to better myself, the harder it pushes back.
anyone else ever feel like the “old you” died years ago, and now you’re just limping along as someone you really can’t stand?
like, the old me wasn’t even that great either but damn 
becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life
i was depressed, failing school, etc and i decided i should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. i went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if i wanted to join the rewards program and i was really craving community at this point and i was super excited. i kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. i started to get to know everybody there very well and now i consider them all friends. i found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. a two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have
is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning?
i know that the fact that i can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. but i’m also sick of constantly feeling like i’m about to break. i hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. each night i think to myself i can’t go on like this and each day i do. part of me just somehow wishes i completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. i don’t know. anyone else feel the same?
2 years since i dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, i finally signed back up for classes yesterday.
i finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! i was so depressed 2 years ago i started skipping classes, i failed every single class i was in. my gpa dropped to a 1.7. i lost my financial aid, which i couldn't go back the next semester without.i spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because i couldn't afford to go back and i ruined my life over depression. but i finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and i'm not allowed to skip class) i still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much i failed but it's a start.edit: i cant believe how many people replied to this!! thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know i had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. also to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)
when you realize that you have an incredibly easy life but you’re screwing it up for yourself
my life is objectively very easy but my depression makes it all feel like a struggle
does anyone else get really happy and motivated for a few hours to a few days, just to fall off the edge again?
it feels like i'm on a rollercoaster with 80% super lows and 20% kinda highs..
does anyone else stay up to 3am every night wanting to die only to get up for school and start the cycle over again every day?
i'm so tired and i hate everything.
after 1 suicide attempt, and one overdose, i graduated!!!!
i made it. fuck everyone who put me down. fuck the bullies, fuck the cliques, i did it. but more importantly, thank you to everyone who kept me going. it brings me to tears thinking about how thankful i am to be here today because of my family, friends, and the wonderful people on this subreddit who helped me when i was down. i feel so immensely proud and happy right now because of my achievements. to all the people struggling through high school and college, there is light at the end of the tunnel. i love you all!!!!edit: wow thanks for all the awards, love, and support!
i miss myself
i miss when i was happy and life wasn't pointless.
the worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality
my actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. but the depression teams up with social anxiety so that i just don't have enough enough energy to act like who i truly am. i turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who i would never want to hang out with or date.it's the main reason i avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because i feel like i'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person. when i'm feeling better and have a little more energy i can act like myself but usually i'm just this shell. it's horrible, like watching the progression of als in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. at least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. i don't even have that privilege. sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how i feel.edit: guys, thanks so much for all the responses. i appreciate all of you. i didn't know so many people felt the same way, and i'm glad if i was able to help give voice to your struggles. i've had depression my whole life so i've had a lot of time to think about these things. i think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. i wish you all luck in getting better.
i wish i could say i was depressed the same way i say i was sick to explain my absence
i'm so tired of making excuses. i am sick, just in my head.
don't you just want to sleep and sleep and sleep?
it's the closest thing to dying. this life sucks.
imagine if the cure to a broken leg was to run a marathon with it. that's what getting help for depression looks like to me.
i'm discouraged today! :d edit: this is a bit overwhelming. but reading all your comments was lovely. i hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day. i guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. you lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and i'll lean on the second person, etc. have a wonderful day ❤️
we only wish depression was being sad.
but depression is much more than that. it’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. it’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. it’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. it’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. it’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. it’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. it’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. it’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. it’s the wall that blocked you off from life. it's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. it’s not just being “sad”. and we can only wish it was. *edited to add: thank you all for the kind words and awards. i really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. i wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*
keeping in touch with friends is so hard when your brain tells you no one wants to talk to you
i have one friend i text regularly. everyone else i either think they don't like me or i don't like them.as an introvert by nature this is so dangerous as i end up in a lonely depression spiral since my tendency is to want alone time, but not alone time all the time.edit: well with this many upvotes, i guess i don't feel as alone. hope everyone is doing ok tonight.
too depressed to have a healthy relationship yet constantly wanting love and affection.
i hate this.
after i revealed i’ve had depression for a very long time, a co-worker told me today that i am the most positive and uplifting person at the office to talk to but she’d known something was wrong because of my eyes.
“your face lights up, your smile is infectious, but your eyes always look like you’re staring at a freight train while you’re standing on the tracks in front of it.”man if that didn’t fuck my shit up for the rest of the day
i almost killed myself today
i just broke down. that just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. i sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if i should write anything. before i could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. he pressed his face to mine and i just snapped back. i’m trying so hard to get better. i’m glad my cat jumped on me. that sweet little guy saved me.edit: i want to thank everyone for their kind words. i didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. for those wondering, i am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.to the few people who said hurtful things. my story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. it’s my experience, i can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. it wouldn’t be real then. to those who told me to try again and that i’m a failure. you don’t have to tell me that. i know but i’ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life.
when i’m sitting on my ass doing nothing, i feel useless and depressed. when i’m actually doing something, i think about how i’d rather be just relaxing at home
just a loop of unhappiness, really hope i can fix it soon.  i wanna know what the fuck happened to my motivation and care for life.
has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression, but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience?
i found that a lot of times in the past i would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that i was already “trying” to do and then i panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session. it’s hard to open up about it when i’m having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion, difficulty thinking and focusing, memory loss and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating... *for not from depression, sorry
do you ever feel that the deeper in depression you are, the dumber you become?
today i was feeling extremely low. i don't know but my i feel like my ability to process information and write has been decreased. i'm just so angry and irritable. i hate this feeling
it’s not that i want to kill myself. but if i die i wouldn’t be upset.
i don’t think i could ever kill myself but that doesn’t mean i don’t want to die. it’d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone i love if something just happened to me and i died. i know it isn’t right to think like this but i can’t stop.edit: this blew up, it’s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same.edit 2: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. i’m home now and would love to reply to all of them but i have to do homework. things will get better for all of us if there’s this much support in the world.
i can overhear my mother on the phone laughing and joking about my depression to her friend
saying things like “she’s so emotional hahaha” and telling her friend everything i just said that was making me upset.everything about me is just a joke to her, just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over.i don’t even know why i’m crying, what else should i expect from someone who hasn’t ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support.
does anybody else ever stay up late so they can avoid tomorrow?

a depressed persons vocabulary i'm fine im okay nah i'm just tired it's not a big deal.
what do you guys say when someone gets mad at you for being sad? or when your being moody because your sad?
do any of you feel like you're lying or being melodramatic every time you try to talk about your mental health?
i think i may have depression, but i find it so hard to talk about, because every time i try i feel like i am just making something out of nothing. i can write out 5 messages to a friend but never send them because everything i write feels like a lie.i managed to initiate a conversation with a friend about it just now, then immediately had to back out of it because everything i wanted to say felt like i was simply seeking attention or somehow trying to trick them. they were so supportive but i shut it down. now i feel even more like i am just being melodramatic or attention seeking.
when i don’t have a job, i want a job. when i have a job, i don’t want a job. when it’s hot, i want it to be cold. when it’s fucking cold, i want it to be hot. when i’m myself i want to be with people, when i’m with people i want to be by myself
do you guys see what i’m saying here. i’m always constantly completely bullshitting myself 24/7. i always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then i get them and i want the opposite. complete self destruction and all 
too depressed to be productive, and not depressed enough to kill myself
i lowkey wish i can be pushed over the edge so i'll have the courage to end it all (as horrible as that sounds)
i feel like i'm getting stupider, less talented, clumsier, and that soon i will be completely retarded.
as the title says. i feel like i'm getting worse and worse at everything. i feel like i'm getting weaker, much much dumber (i used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. now i've forgotten most things unless i read up on it daily, i've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and i've become completely socially unaware). things that used to be easy are now difficult, i constantly make typos and i can't even concentrate on things i like, much less things i dislike.anyone else feel like that?
anyone like being in the shower not for the purpose to get clean but standing in the water while the hot water just runs through your body while you just stare
it makes me feel less alone and its like im safe from everything in there and a sense of dread takes over me when im finished and i have to get out and face the world again weird post lol sorry
i hope being dead is like sleeping,because im tired,i really am,i just want to sleep forever and never wake up again

today i woke up and didn’t want to die.
after bordering on suicidal yesterday, i was surprised to find i had the motivation to get out of bed when i woke up this morning. the first thing i did was make my bed, and that’s a victory in my book. i love you all.edit: thank you for the silver, and for the heartwarming comments. it means a lot!edit 2: this has me all kinds of emotional. i’ve never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers.
fun fact: when i was younger many people told me i was a gifted child of above average intelligence.
well i sure showed them, didn't i?i'm a massive fuckup. i forget things the minute after i am told them. there's just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head. my grammar has devolved into caveman-speak.i dunno if i blame my mental health or if i'm just stupid.
an unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities
this has been really scaring me lately. since becoming depressed i've noticed more and more;- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people- severely reduced attention span- short term memory loss- severely reduced motivationi think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as i spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when i actually try to focus on work i usually end up crying. the result seems to be a feeling like i've been living in a haze, like i'm never really fully aware of what's going on, i'm just passively going through the motions of life. getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than i thought. i literally feel stupider now that i've been depressed for months. i can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while i'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence.
is anyone else hating the fact that they’re wasting time of their life as you’re witnessing it all go in the drain because of their stupid mental illness holding you down?
it’s so stressful. there’s so many things i want to do but i just can’t at the moment and it sucks. theoretically, i could be physically paralyzed for months and it would be just the same as if i wasn’t paralyzed and living my regular depressed life. watching your life go by without any motives and meaning as you have no one there beside you because you’ve kicked everyone out of your life is one of the worst feelings for me.
do you ever get so empty you’re excited when you finally start crying because at least you’re feeling an emotion?
i’ve felt empty for days and just now cried a little. even though i’m miserable i was almost happy. it’s worse to feel like you’re dead than being sad.
anybody feel like you died long ago, and you're just a zombified shell?
i just go through the routine every day, and kinda let everything just pass by. i don't really have much of an emotional response to anything, and my personality feels like a mush of stuff. like, whenever things go wrong, people say they want to die, and while, yeah, i don't like what happened, i just feel kinda... neutral.
anyone else barely hanging on to life with no motivation whatsoever?
too much of a coward to kill myself, but at the same time have no reason to live. i just need to know that i’m not alone who feels like this in this hour.
mom died last night going to be needing all your love and support.
my depression has been doing so good, i’m so proud. but my mom passed away last night of pulmonary veno occlusive disease. really needing positivity in these trying times. thank you so much <3
anyone else get super motivated at night to get your life together, then when it's daytime that motivation is gone?
i wish i could still be motivated throughout the day. 
anyone been depressed for so long they don't even know if they are depressed or if they are just really boring?
i don't know if i'm depressed or if i've just lost my personality and identity. i don't know if this is me now or what? i'm nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it. 7 years back dad said it was just a stage i'm going through, yet here i am. all my friends are still themselves i'm completely fucking different
the reality of depression: yesterday i was googling most effective suicide methods. today i feel fine.
this has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. i'm 50 now, so obviously i haven't succumbed to depression yet. but the peaks and valleys are insane; i guess *i'm* insane. yesterday it fully made sense to me - if i had had immediate means to end my life i could see taking that action. this is why i can never have a gun, or live in a tall building.  so far that small voice in me that says it will get better, just wait has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says you've always been alone. you'll always be alone. life isn't worth the pain. my reality is having both of those voices in my brain, and feeling that both are absolutely real when they're there.
do you ever doubt the validity of your depression? and just think that the reason you can’t do normal things, is just because you’re a bad person?
my depression has depression bro. a lot of the time i doubt that i have a mental illness, and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things. i feel empty all the time, yeah, i have a diagnosis, yeah, but i still manage to doubt myself anyways. it almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. it’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. it seems like feeling this way is normal, but i also feel like i’m alone in this? it’s weird. i tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” i tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. but deep down i would give anything in the world to feel happiness. i hope this isn’t just me. like deadass, i don’t know if i’m the only person who feels like this. and if i am that’s just gonna scare me.
fuck this shit dude, how in the hell is anyone supposed to keep up with scjool, work, social life, healthy eating + exercise, and hobbies?
i'm so fucking done with this shit. i've had multiple exams this week all during my colleges green beer day fesitivies, which i've had to skip due to studying. then i get asked why i'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why i haven't been going to the gym with them. then my parents asking why i'm spending money at chipotle and wendy's and shit like i'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. then i'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit i like to do. fuck this. how is anyone supposed to do this? what the fuck is the point. sorry for ranting. fuck this week. been shit. anyone want to talk? i need a study break i wanna help some people, maybe do some good in this fucked world. love all of you 
nobody gives a fucking shit about you until you mention killing yourself.
this world and all the people living in it is such a heaping pile of horseshit. nobody has a fuck to give about mental illness. it's blatantly obvious. fuck this.edit: this post isn't about me, it's about other people.
i shouldn't have to lie about my depression to get a sick day
but i do. every time. because saying i threw up everywhere last night gets you a oh sweetie, take the day off to rest, it's okay!, but saying my depression is acting up really badly and i just can't do it today gets you a don't be lazy! everyone gets sad, suck it up and come into work!.i shouldn't have to be fucking ashamed of my depression. it's as medical as the flu, yet people seem to think mental illnesses aren't a valid reason, and that you're not really sick.fuck that shit. we need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general.
i’m a christmas person, but this year i’m just... empty.
i’ve felt better these past few months. a lot better, great even. but this christmas it’s like... i can’t bring myself to care for the holidays - and it’s my favourite holiday. i can’t explain it. my family lives two hours away and i almost didn’t go, just because i wanted to be alone in my apartment, doing absolutely nothing. but i’m a single child, my parents are single children, all my grandparents are dead - it’s just us three. they’re getting old, too. i couldn’t just *not* go. they would have been so sad and i don’t want that.but i’m just empty and miserable and it’s christmas so i have to put up a front, a nice dress and be nice.gosh this is hard.merry christmas.edit: wow, you guys know how to make someone feel special and a little less alone. thank you, kind strangers! ❤️
i deleted my note!
i had a long, very long suicide not stored in my phone, just waiting, and yesterday i deleted  it, i know it it’s not a huge step, but i feel ultimately better!update- i didn’t expect this to blow up, i posted it because i couldn’t believe i had finally done it; and i had felt so good, i’m trying to say thank you to everyone who commented, thank you to whoever gave me gold, you’re the best, and you all are amazing. thank you!update 2- to everyone saying i inspired them to delete theirs, i cannot comprehend how good that made me feel that i helped to inspire you guys, i am so proud of every one of you. thank you for all the love and support. i’m blown away and feel incredibly uplifted right now.
sleeping is the only activity i don't hate because it's like a free trial of not existing
dreaming is also a bonus. sure the occasional nightmares are bad, but at least it's better than being awake, where you feel bad 100% of the time.
anyone else get lost in their daydreams and get hit with a wave of depression when you snap back to reality?
i spend so much time thinking about how i wish my life was that i can’t face the actuality of where i am.
absolutely nothing interests me anymore. i fucking hate it.
i literally don’t want to do anything at all. it doesn’t bring me any happiness or joy or whatever. at best, just distracts me from feeling shitty. absolutely nothing helps. video games, writing, reading, doing photography, drawing... none of that makes me happy.it’s the absolute fucking worst. i don’t even feel like sleeping, but i don’t wanna be awake either. i go to bed before 7pm because i have nothing else i wanna do. all i do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry, then i go to sleep, wake up and repeat.i hate living. i hate this existence. i wish i could just die in my sleep.edit: this got a lot more attention than i thought so i just wanna day that i’m reading all your comments and i love you all
why i stopped opening up.
bottling emotions is extremely unhealthy. you know, you can talk to me about anything.*dumps brain onto poor unsuspecting soul*wow, you should talk to a therapist about that. i believe in you though!edit: thanks for all the supportive comments. to those suggesting i not open up to people who don't get it, i completely agree. this has happened to me when opening up to people who used to be very close friends who don't really have the time for me anymore. i'm not just dumping my brain on anyone who asks.
how many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up?
i read this a lot here, i don't want to kill myself, i just wish i didn't exist. i identify with that...  so much. i just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as i'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). all i want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. is that so much to ask for?edit: wow, i did not expect to get so many responses when i wrote this yesterday. although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know i'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. for those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. i hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as i hope that i can too. but let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again.
my friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. my family is saying i will ruin christmas if i spend time with her in the hospital on christmas eve instead of visiting them. what can i do?
a good friend of mine with whom i've been attending therapy for bpd overdosed a couple days ago. she survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. she woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. i want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. i had plans to see my family for christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. to elaborate, i don't like spending christmas with my family. i like them, but christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. i thought i would spend christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. i don't want her to be alone, i know that if i were in her situation i would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. so i proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that i would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. however, their comments left gasping for air. they showed little empathy for my friend or me. my mother asked me if i had any normal friends. my brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, i would be ruining christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying i would be at fault for them. here's the breakdown:  with my family, i risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if i don't go down there. however, i've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while i've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and bpd than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me not having enough social activity, as not having enough will, and have called my therapy a waste of time. i feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, i know i will think of her the whole time i would be down at my family's, but i do not want to be ostrasized for months. i don't think i could handle it with my mental condition. any and all thoughts are welcome. thank you.
does anyone else experience anger as a part of depression?
i always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and i've felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head. so many things piss me off. i sometimes even go into borderline misanthropy because of my depression induced anger. it's led me to have fights with people who are my family and friends and i don't know why i push them away
does anyone else sleep a lot to escape the pain?
i sleep so much. i enjoy it because it’s an escape without death. i don’t want to die but i don’t enjoy living, so i sleep. it’s a way of “living” without actually having to live. sigh. if i could stay in bed all day and sleep, i would.
suicide ice cream
i contemplated suicide a few years ago. couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. so one day i decided to kill myself by hanging. pretty straight forward right? well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. they were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. i'd make them feel bad. and someone would take my shit, cant have that. very surreal and fustrating using google maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty metropcs service.finally i found a spot. small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. good. now for the suicide note. i get to work, banging it out all through the night. not meant for this world i know you'll miss me but it's for the best. hit all the basic bullet points. done. now..........make a noose. but idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on wikihow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. all of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. i'm proud of myself?? i'm proud if myself!!! i try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. i made a noose, thats kind of dope. what else can i make? homemade ice cream? hmm. so at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.p.s. the ice cream was terrible
i'm breaking apart and no one gives a fuck.
i swear to god, if i manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like if only she talked to us we'd have helped i'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell.keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else will use them to hurt you.
does anyone habitually say things like i fucking hate myself
i've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc i'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. it's reached the point where instead of saying fuck when something goes wrong i'll say i want to kill myself. it's become so engrained in my mind that i've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around. anyone else do this?
i’m killing myself [update]
so most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but i just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago i was so close to taking my own life. i was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. i was drunk so it made matters only worse. as i sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. this voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that i have so much more going for me, and i can’t lose my life over some girl. so here i am, 3 days later. the girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. we are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. my happiness can’t be dependent on another person. that is unhealthy. i’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. i know in the end i can conquer these demons.i would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. i obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. thank you once again, and i hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. we all deserve it. this is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, i’m better than you.”
being alive is a scam
i get panic attacks over simple things i get really sad over small things wish i wasn’t so irrationaledit: listened to alexandrov ensemble and lots of blade runner and it’s helped clear my head. music really helps homies
people don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling.
i usually decline social events when i'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?so, i'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. but it's not that i don't want to be around people. i just don't want to pretend all night that i'm this other person -- i do that all day at work; it's exhausting. but to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit.
my girlfriend cheated on me with one of my best friends while i was at the psych ward for trying to kill myself. someone please cheer me up
so this happened about 5 months ago but i found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me. we had been dating just about a year and i genuinely loved her with all my heart. i trusted her so much and she knew i have severe depression. i cant understand how another human can be that shitty. anyone willing to talk?edit: just found out she cheated on me with another guy too. she's completely blaming it on me despite me treating her nothing but great while we dated. back to feeling terrible again, just after the responses to this post made me actually feel pretty good :')
“people with depression don’t want to die, they just don’t want to be alive”
this quote helps me to explain how i feel, when people ask questions about depression
i´ve been told my whole childhood how intelligent i was. now i can't live up to those expectations put upon me by others and myself. i feel like a failure.
i am one of probably millions of people who where told as kids how intelligent they were, but i don't see it in myself and i can't live up to those expectations put upon me. in middle school i got lazy and relied on my intelligence too much. now i i feel like everyone has surpassed me just because my naive 10 year old self thought that i was somehow special or above average. now in almost everything i score below average and can't keep up with others. its been like this for all of the latter part of middle school and my high school years. now as everyone else is just about to graduate, its not even clear if i even will graduate. everyone has clear goals and ambitions where as i don't see any real future for myself.
anyone else have underlying sadness even when doing something fun?
like i'll be out trying to enjoy myself and i'll be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but i still feel sad underneath, hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling. even hobbies i have just seem dull and i'm usually just trying to mask the pain so i don't have to feel. i hate this.
anybody else feel like they're quietly panicking all of the time?
like, not a full blown panic attack, but just the constant uncomfortable feeling of something not being right?
$200 will travel
a few weeks ago my depression got the best of me and i went off the deep end and quit my job.  i had $200 to my name and half a tank of gas. so i drove west. as far west as laguna beach. i had never seen the ocean before. i spent $50 bucks on a hotel room outside of town. i put my toes in the sand and surf. the experience was something i will never forget. also, the ocean is way bigger than i thought it would be no matter how dumb that sounds. it gave me the will power to keep going for some dumb reason. not sure why i am sharing this other than to say that you never know what type of experience will bring you back, so to speak.i’m back home with an interview next week.sometimes things aren’t as black as they are grey.edit: i got the job. for anyone who cares. good times.
do you ever lay there in the dark, just staring into the nothingness, and then 5 hours went by somehow and you cant remember if you fell asleep or not.
this has happened to me twice this week. i think i’m dying.
does anyone feel like the less interesting person while hanging around other people?
like, your presence is not important, everything would be the same even without you.
i convinced myself i was going to commit suicide sometime in the next 2 weeks. then i walked to the kitchen and saw my beautiful, loving family. now i cant stop crying
i want to die so badly, but i cant do this to them. they greeted me with smiles and joy. my mother asking if i ate anything and if i wanted breakfast. my elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how i slept. i dont want to make them suffer. if it weren't for them i would've killed myself already. they are also sick and need my help. i cant a abondon them. i'm so sick of living, but i have to live for them. i just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way.
anyone else feel like their fake depressed?
it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen. i don't know. edit: hey so i'm not the only one who feels this way. if anything it's slightly comforting to know thatedit 2: yes i'm aware of the spelling mistake in the title, it's kinda hard to spell correctly when you're rambling at 11 pm
depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident
i never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? i can't understand how this is just so commonplace. i laugh at them. theyre funny. i see myself in them. and then for hours and days upon days i lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. i stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. i don't sleep for days on end until i collapse. i lose weight in 7 pound intervals. the thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad i would beat the shit out of myself if i met myself on the street just stew any time im beside myself. it's so funny! so quirky and relatable! if this is relatable that's fucking tragic. being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something i want everyone to laugh at with me. it's three am here and i'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because i don't wanna think about anything. i wish there was a way to turn brains off. medications haven't worked and i don't like being medicated at all anyway. it feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime i try to feel anything. sure is loads of fun.
feel like i'll never be able to have a normal loving relationship because of my depression and my personality
how can someone love a mess like me? how can someone love me with all this fog in my brain, with these glaring imperfections, with a dark cloud above her head?
one of the shittiest feelings is having a dream where you're genuinely happy then waking up to reality.
this happens to me a few times a year. it's like my brain is teasing me.
anyone feels jealous and bitter that you’re stagnating while everyone around you is moving forward?
as much as i wish people the best, i have to fight feelings of bitterness and jealousy all the damn time. i wanna know how to better cope with these feelings.
does anyone else get random moments of clarity where you think oh crap, i'm actually very mentally ill.
had one of those today. it feels like, for just a moment, i understand that i am indeed suffering from an illness. it's such a strange contrast from constantly thinking you're not actually sick, you're just a terrible person.anyone else experience something similar?
realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.
sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually i will commit suicide. this realization really fucks me up. i wish this wasn’t the case. i wish so much i could be normal and happy but it’s been years and i’ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. i hope i’m proven wrong.edit: it’s been 160 days since i posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset i still come back often and read all the new comments. those of you who commented or will comment i see you and just wanted to say thank you we’re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together.
why the fuck does being alive always have to feel like an uphill battle. i can't fucking ever keep up.
i'm so fucking tired of feeling like i can't ever catch up. to anyone or anything. i can't keep up with life i'm so fucking tired of it. why do i always feel like being alive is an uphill battle. i feel like i was damned upon conception. i was fucked from the start. with my fucked up head and my fucked up emotions i was fucked from the start. i never stood a chance here. why the living fuck do i always feel like i'm a thousand steps behind everyone else. sometimes i want to end my life so badly but i am too afraid to hurt my family. i keep holding out for some god damn hope but every single fucking time it is proven that i am hopeless. i don't even know why i am on here i do not ever talk about my emotions nor do i ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired i don't know where else to put it... i don't think that i will ever be happy. i don't think i will ever live my life to the fullest. i don't think i'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. i don't think that i will ever amount to anything extraordinary. i don't think i will fulfill the wishes of god or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. i don't think that i will ever love myself. i don't know where else to go.... so i don't go anywhere. i remain here in this stagnant cycle.
nobody cares if you're suicidal, only if you commit suicide
i have been through a roller coaster of absolute pain and there is no light at the end of the tunnel that isn't just more of this roller coaster ride. the people close to me no longer show concern because that's just who i am to people now. they either don't know me, or they know how much i'd love to not exist but am still not strong enough to put an end to it. and that's the thing isn't it?    **nobody cares until you're gone.** nobody cares until you can 'prove it'. we're 'attention seekers', except i've isolated myself from everyone and i don't communicate how i feel anymore to anyone but internet strangers who also don't know me and therefore don't care.     unless you're actually about to pull the trigger, people would prefer if you shut up, fucked off, stop bringing down the mood, stop being a burden, you're simultaneously too much and yet not enough.       they don't care what's causing my misery. god forbid i mention a person, or people are the stressors to what i'm feeling. that is manipulation. suicidal people are manipulative. we just latch on to people and bring them down.    i'm sorry. i don't want to be this way. i have asked, pleaded, begged for help. nobody has offered anything to actually help me. throwing vague suggestions and hotlines and websites isn't help. leaving me to figure out my own shit does not help.     at the very least i have learned how to bottle most things up. nobody will have to worry about hearing about my pain. and eventually, hopefully soon, nobody will have to worry about me at all.    edit: i think a lot of people misunderstood. nobody in my inner circle is foreign to mental health struggles. my mother is half the reason i have them, biologically speaking. we have similar symptoms. i've made it clear what kind of help i need and what i need help with to get there. i'm shrugged off because my struggling with suicidal ideation is not as pressing of a matter as whatever else is going on.  this was also general observation of how people react to suicidal people.
i wish i could have a fatal accident instead of committing suicide.
i want to die and leave this black hole of self hate and overwhelming sadness. i have a wonderful husband and two amazing teenage boys, and yet i find no joy in life. i don't want to commit suicide and scar my family that way. i just hope every day that i'll have a fatal heart attack, stroke, or get hit head on by a semi.
i’ve been diagnosed for 20 years - yesterday i quit my $100k+ high pressure sales job to become an 8th grade science teacher.
yesterday i made the decision to make mental health my priority, after years of telling myself money can make me happy.  yesterday i decided to be happy.  thinking about you all.edit:  never received gold before, so thank you kind stranger.  also, to those saying teaching isn’t easy, no one said that it was easy.  everyone has different personality traits.  please remember this is a post celebrating mental health, and to instill hope in others. edit 2:  another very large deciding factor - one of my best friends shot himself in the head on christmas eve 2017.  the impact is real.  
god dammit. i should be able to tell people i have suicidal thoughts sometimes without them freaking the fuck out. i feel like killing myself sometimes. there, i said it. doesn't mean i'm going to do it.
i told my wife yesterday that i have suicidal thoughts sometimes and what i'm doing about it to feel better. needless to say she went over the top about all the reasons i shouldn't and then went and told my mom without my permission. guess i'm not telling her anything anymore. i'm in this shit alone.
depression is when you don't really care about anything, anxiety is when you care too much about everything. and having both is just like hell.

i had a personality once but now i can't remember who i am
j remember i used to be funny. i used to laugh and make jokes. i remember being able to hold a conversation with people. i wanted to know people and give back. i was shy but querky,  talkative and funny around people who knew me. now i'm nothing. i don't seem to laugh or smile anymore. i feel numb and unsatisfied with everything i do.edit: wow thank you everyone for your responses. i thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that i'm not alone. we just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on. on a side note..i'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. i sometimes think part of the reason is i have this intense fear of losing people. so much in fact that i start believing in  the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes they'll like me  and not leave. i just agree and comply with everything. i've done this for so long i just don't know who i am anymore.
cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place i feel accepted. we may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices.
whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  &nbsp;whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. nobody one-ups one another. this sub's etiquette is the epitome of always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.  &nbsp;on other subs like askreddit, whenever i post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. i seriously don't care about karma, i just wish my questions become visible because i'm genuinely curious. my questions are usually something like, people who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?.  &nbsp;i ask those questions because i'm looking for hope. i try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. that makes me feel like i'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. it's like i'm being denied hope.  &nbsp;on this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2k upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. so that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. if they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. we use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.  &nbsp;r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.we just want to be heard, i guess. and we understand that about each other. cheers, everyone. wish you all the best of getting through your day.
does anyone else get those little highs that last like 10-15 seconds where you feel like you can do anything and are genuinely motivated and no one can stop you..but then it passes and you're back to feeling like complete shit?

i wish i could give my life to someone who actually wants to live
fuck new years by the way
nobody talks about the memory loss
i have days where i feel like i'm being gaslighted or getting dementia. no told me when i was diagnosed about the memory issues. so if this is news to anyone here, you might be going mad but not in the way you think. its just the shitty disease.
anyone else used to be bright in school, but now feel like a bum?
sorry if my language sounds harsh but that's how i feel about myself now. used to be a good student, not too bright but put an effort, dreamed to study in the west, teachers kept telling me i'd go places.now unemployed (only an unstable freelance job), living alone with no friends and no energy to pursue any hobby anymore. play video games pointlessly, then sleep, usually with an empty stomach.such is life. hope y'all doing ok.just to clarify, as long as you feel like a bum, it counts. depression doesn't discriminate i guess.
anyone else just feel bored of everything?
i dunno. nothing excites me anymore. i wake up and i don’t know what to look forward to. i’m not having any suicidal thoughts and i don’t think i ever will, but i’m really struggling to feel happy.
woke up, realized it was christmas, and broke down sobbing.
i just woke up an hour ago. i don't know why, but i always really struggle with christmas. i started getting so sad that it was getting hard to breathe. the worst ideations i've had in a while. i almost blocked my fiance because my brain kept telling me that i'm a problem. thank god my brother came in with the puppy and it snapped me out of it a bit.hope everyone is safe today.
anyone else stay awake late just because the idea of “tomorrow” feeling exactly like today is such a depressing thought?
i know depression can sometimes be sleeping to much or little, but this is different.it’s just that knowing that i’m not going going to fall asleep and stay asleep, that i’ll wake up in the morning and have to do this all over again, is so soul sucking that i force myself to stay up as late as i can. 
it’s my 25th birthday today. even though i don’t mind living in solitude and actually prefer it often due to my mental illness symptoms— birthdays remind me how much it is my own fault and my mental illness made me lose all friends in my life and that i truly am alone.
spending it yet again treating myself to gifts and food. even if friends were there to celebrate it with me i just can’t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy. i’m always stuck in my own world of depressing obsessive thoughts and need to be left alone.i don’t want to be left alone.
does anyone else wish that you could sleep forever?
i'm not speaking suicidal.i just like sleeping. sometimes i get weird dreams, but slumber is a nice alternative to dealing with the stress/anxiety/depression.
anyone else feel like they can’t learn shit?
i’ve always been that kid that used to catch things fast,the one who’s been called smart compared to others at my age ,but now i just feel like i can’t really learn anything new,half of the time i just find myself hearing shit that goes through one ear and goes by the other,can’t remember shit that i just saw it 5m ago,sometimes i need to reed the same topic over and over again just bc i can’t focking process it right, fuck thatedit:grammaredit 2: thanks for all the replies guys i never  thought i would get so many replies for so many things i’ve been asking myself and i also learned  names of sensations i experienced that i didn’t know how to describe,  anyways thanks for all the support and help making me feel less lonely in this crazy world :)
i (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. i feel like it's a sign i need to step up my action against depression. what are some things i can do to alleviate my depression?
the title and this story may sound fake (new account to hopefully protect my identity), but i swear to you it could not be more real for me. i wanted to share this, i am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. more questions will be asked at the end of my story.  as the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. the paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast i was going, and i replied 200 km/h.i have been depressed for 4 years now. nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. i have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (cbt), and even went a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ect). first my motivation to do anything went down; i couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. my social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, i figured life wasn't going to get any better and i decided to end my life.i drove to the mountains where i decided i would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. about 3 hours from my hometown i found the perfect hill, the road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. without thinking too much (i would just talk myself out and not commit), i pulled a u-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. they say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. the most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. they suddenly disappeared as i approached my chosen hill. my foot automatically floored the gas pedal, i placed my left foot behind the brake so i wouldn't back out. i raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time i reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. i saw the road start to bend and i jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. that was the last thing i remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. all i could think to myself at that moment was wow, i so much of a failure i can't even kill myself. a bystander described to the paramedics and police that i hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. i got a glimpse of my car before i was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. when i arrived to the hospital i was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. he assessed me and ordered a full-body ct scan. the results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. he then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which i won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).the everyone's surprise i was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. this phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person i have talked to so far has said: it's a miracle you're alive. i'm not religious, but i agree, it is a miracle i'm alive, and im not going to waste it. i'm begging for help because i know this community loves to help people when they reach out. i really want to try and beat my depression but i don't know how. i have tried cbt, i'm going back to ect for another round of treatment and i'm on increased medication. i will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons i decided to end it, due to lack of resources).if anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. i'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and i believe it's a sign that i need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. i am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. i can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.please help with any advice you have, i'm begging for my life to change, please. i am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so i can give life another try.here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:\-how do i keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?\-how can i keep up or have more energy?\-i'm thinking of going back to school for nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and i'm looking for something more. is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)\-what are some habits i could do to alleviate my depression\-any secret self-help/feel good tips?\-how do i make more friends and build a better support network?\-what do i tell to my friends who have noticed i just disappeared for a few days?&#x200b;thanks to those who took the time to read this post, i usually get little to no reads on reddit but i thought i'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.edit: more questionsedit 2: thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. i truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. i will try and reply/read everyones post but i am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. but i am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. thank you, i will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.
hate when normal people ask me what i've been doing all day and i have to lie.
nothing ok, i lay in my bed depressed and slept till 6pm alright? sorry i can't be normal and productive like you up at 9am with 50 friends. i'm a creature of darkness and death, you wouldn't understand my life you grew up with a happy loving middle class family. my entire life has been suffering and hate everything. i'm so tired of pretending i have a job and pretending to be normal. i'm exhausted.
i'm not doing any better i just got better at hiding it.
instead of called in from work or breaking down during my shift i cry on the drive to work.instead of ranting on instagram or ranting on facebook i cry myself to sleep.instead of telling people how i feel, i say im fine and smile knowing no one could understand how fucked iam.instead of threating to kill myself, ive come to terms with the fact that i'll be gone soon once i get to my breaking point and end it all.
anyone else feel like maybe you are just starting to get it together and then one little f*&# up sends you plummeting into the abyss again?
it does not even have to be a major incident, but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole, that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around, suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit; and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again ...
it hurts realizing who you really are
it hurts realizing that your not this deep down to earth interesting smart person. realizing you just a piece of trash that is useless. it doesnt matter wether im here or not. it just breaks my heart to realize that.
i want someone to notice how not okay i really am
i feel so empty. to the point that things i used to laugh at i no longer find amusing. call me a coward but ive never told anyone about the way i feel maybe in order to be able to carry on with life with no more complications. i just want  someone to hold me close and tell me its going to be ok. i guess this is my cry for help.
“i used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. it's not. the worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone“
this quote by robin williams has destroyed me. i’ve realized why i hate being with people more than being alone, even if i’m smiling and having fun. *edit* wow, thanks so much to every single supportive comment. means more than the world to feel supported. to everyone suggesting social media is a cause of this- is not the case here. i don’t use social media, because i know the conversations on there don’t follow me to my grave ❤️ real life human connection does. today was a good day, thankyou everyone for your love.
nobody cares when you're depressed until you commit suicide
wait suicide just passes the pain to next person
i wish i could transfer all my remaining days to someone who actually enjoys living.

i hate myself so much i actually repeat the phrase i hate myself to myself multiple times a day.
especially when i think about all the terrible and cringey things i have done. theres no getting around i'm a piece of shit so i feel better by accepting it.
made a new friend
today i noticed a girl at my school had a semicolon tattoo (;) and i showed her mine. we really clicked and exchanged phone numbers. i think i made a new friend
ever not speak a single word in a whole day?
sometimes i forget it’s even a possibility
does anyone else want to kill themself but they don’t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt
the worst part is now i have a girlfriend that i’ve dating for a while and i’m crazy about her and we’ve talked about our future together numerous times and she’s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those i care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy
does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression?
when i feel ok, i feel off. when i sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied. it's like my life is so shit that if i'm not feeling overly depressed about it there is something off. like i'm wasting time being ok or even happy. this might make zero sense, but it's a feeling i've had for so long.
did anyone else's depression fuck up their career or university/schooling experience?
i was a high-achieving student in high school, went to university and shit hit the fan, graduated a year later than everyone else and is still unemployed 9 months later. i think about killing myself everyday, some days the thoughts are more active (with intention and a plan) and some days they're more passive. i look at who i used to be and get so sad. but i think ahead about the jobs and career choices, and i don't want to work in a cubicle 9+ hours a day for the next 40 years in a company that i don't give a shit about. 
i have no personality
does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression? for me the downward spiral started when i was 11 or so, so being depressed is basically all i remember. i don't know who i was before that, or who i am now. i always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person i'm talking to, putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality i fake for them. i can't, for the life of me, tell you a single characteristic of me, except for my anxiety and depression. when i'm alone, i tend to talk to myself (probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction, and yeah i know it's weird) and then i feel like a blanc slate. like there's nothing to me. this is my first ever post on reddit and i'm extremely anxious about it, but i've wanted to tell this to someone for such a long time and now i found this sub.
25, an aging, worthless failure
i have failed in nearly everything i had set out to do. i have no confidence to do anything else. i have no proper education, no friends, no job, no travel experience, no positive memories, no good relationships with anyone, no confidence, no productive hobbies, no self worth, and no future.i'm worthless trash at the peak of my youth. the people i grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world, enjoying their lives. i am sat here taking care of my needy family, looking for pathetic jobs, and engaging in escapism to forget that i am who i am.i am 25 years old this year, a stupid idiot, a weak coward, a life loser, and a complete waste of space
it's lonely.
i've been crying nonstop for 3months. getting into university have made my condition worst. it's lonely here. i want to tell more but i just have no energy to type.hope those who read this.. good day to you.edit:i didn't believe that my first post will get over 1k upvotes. thank you for all the kind messages. thank you. i have read all of it. thank you. truly made my day better. i will try to hold on and to those who are struggling too, keep your heads up too, try to love yourself, ourselves more. we can't lose hope.
i don’t wanna kill myself, but i don’t want to necessarily exist either?
like, i wish that instead of having my crappy, depressing consciousness being tied down to my body, i could just exist as a floating, formless concept instead. right now my mind and body feel incredibly heavy and all i can do is lie down in the dark. i wish i could be free and light and weightless.i don’t want to kill myself. i doubt i’d even have it in me to inflict physical pain on myself. but i don’t wanna exist like i currently do either. can anyone relate?
anyone else previously cared way too much and now is completely apathetic to everything?
yup... that’s me. i think this is the depression that completely scares me most because days pass and i don’t do anything at all and don’t accomplish anything because i don’t give a fuck and then i look back and so much time has gone to waste
has anyone ever felt they won’t ever reach their full potential because of their depression?
i would like to hear your thoughts.
i wanted to kill my self last night but instead i called an ambulance
no real reason for posting i’m just proud of myself for making the choice i did.edit: this is not what i expected. thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. in the real world, only my partner knows that i even have depression because i don’t want to stress people out. i’m honestly so overwhelmed. i thought i would answer some common questions in an edit, and i’ll slowly get to each comment as i can . firstly the cost- i’m an aussie and i have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. i can’t believe some people have to pay. i wouldn’t have called if i knew i did. second - what happened after i called. i had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had i overdosed / self harmed etc.) i explained that i had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days i forgot them. i called because i started to feel like i couldn’t trust my brain, and i had a plan i was worried i would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. i had also had a panic attack right before i called, which i had never had before and oh boy was that scary. so off i went. it was all very gentle and calm. i basically just needed someone to watch me while i waited it out / for my meds to kick in. i slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so i keep in touch with my partner. in the morning i was given my meds (i had remembered them the dish before). i had various meeting were they explained that they were happy i called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. i had a long meeting with a doctor where i went through everything (i was first diagnosed 5 years ago with ptsd and depression) and the difficulties i’ve had getting help. i had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. so they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) they also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which i hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. lastly i was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. i haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if i’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when i’m struggling too. i’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. lastly they recommended i get my dosage upped a little bit. then i was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. they also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.
do you ever feel too ugly to leave the house?
hair doesn’t style right, my makeup looks off, my outfit looks like crap. 3 hours of getting ready later....and i just cry and don’t end up going out. this is my life 90% of the time trying to go anywhere. i’m exhausted, and i hate it. anyone relate?edit: wow, by the likes it seems like i’m definitely not alone. thank you for sharing. sending you all well wishes that we can overcome this feeling and feel adequate, as i know we all deserve to feel accepted in society as we are. hugs to you all 
anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older?
ever since i was young, i can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. i would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and i didn't realise until i was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back. 
y’all ever just give up mid-day and zone the fuck out and start staring into space for prolonged periods of time?????
like i was at work and my body just shut down and decided not to try anymore so i just stared into space for what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually 30. fuckkkkk this
do you ever just cry for the person you used to be?
even with my chemical imbalance i used to be an active, social person. i was fun-loving and outgoing and for the most part happy.  now it seems all i do is go to work, come home and sleep. i want to do things i used to enjoy but i’m so drained by just surviving. i try so hard but i can’t push myself to. it breaks my heart and i grieve for the person i used to be because i don’t feel like she’s even a part of me anymore.
i fucking hate being depressed all the time
no, i'm in no danger of offing myself so no need to send out the cavalry. but i am so tired of having to remember what it feels like feel good instead of actually feeling good. i'm tired of having to remind myself that how i feel is not normal. i'm tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me. i'm tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today.  every fucking day. i'm tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday. i'm tired of having to have some mild stimulant just to feel whole. pardon the pun, but my depression is fucking depressing.
you ever want to cry but, physically can’t
i’ve been wanting to cry for a few weeks now and it’s become hard for me to cry. i don’t know necessarily know why i want to cry. the other day i was watching endgame and tony’s death always gets me sad but, i couldn’t cry like i did when i saw it in theaters. i want to cry but i physically can’t. why?
nobody at all cares how depressed you are when you're alive, as long as you don't kill yourself. now if i kill myself, then i'm just a huge selfish jerk who didn't think about anybody. jerks...

i feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead
if i had cancer, i could say i needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. i could apply for and receive disability. i could freely tell my patients i was gone for 3 months or whatever bc i was doing chemo. no one would suggest that i dont need medicine bc jesus died for my sins. i could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think i'm lazy. they'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. people would rally around me. i could post about my journey on facebook without shame. when i fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me i dont have it bad at all. my health problems would be validated. most importantly i wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.edit: thanks for all the responses! let me rephrase something here. i dont wish i had cancer. i wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer. i'm not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes.
you’re depressed because you’re not grateful
today i got told that “you only get depressed because you aren’t grateful for the things that you already have.”
i don't want to kill myself but i just wish there was a way to stop existing.
i just want to stop existing, no one would have any memories of me, nor feel sad as they wouldn't have known me.is it so bad to say, i didn't ask to be here, my life is shit and hard, i'm very sad and i just don't like this life game. i just want to go back to my pre birth state of not existing.
fuck me, i'm so tired of pretending.
i am always the guy making jokes and making people smile and helping them out. truth is. i just use everyone as a distraction from my own shit life. i'm an introvert pretending to be extroverted.
do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?
i think about it a lot. my mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. one is in an ivy league school and the other is going to a nice university. they both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. i don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or i have to go out somewhere. i have severe adhd and don't really do well taking basic classes. i just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. she always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when i was first born. and i just think if only she knew how i would turn out. it wasn't her fault, though. she is such a loving caring person. she didn't deserve this. anytime my dad comes home from work i have trouble even looking him in the eye because i know i'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. i act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. i wish i could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. no matter what i do, everybody loses. 
today i brushed my teeth, took, a shower, exercised, vacuumed, played with my cat, stayed hydrated, and read a book.
still want to die. still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. still a burden to everyone in my life. edit: went to bed after writing this post (i say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. thank you for your kind words. edit 2: i'm in tears right now. i really didn't expect this kind of response and i'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. i've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. letting this out felt so good and i'm truly touched by everyone's comments. i'll be honest, i just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but i appreciate this community so much. 
does anyone else hurt so much emotionally that it feels physical?
it feels like i constantly have a negative feeling in my chest, that's constantly there all day, but feels like it gets way worse when i feel more lonely/sad/negative.i've never hugged anyone before, so when i sleep i hug a really soft blanket i have, to feel at least somewhat better, but i always feel even more lonely and i usually cry, and i've noticed that feeling in my chest gets much worse when i feel worse emotionally.
somebody noticed i am not ok
went to a doctor today because i suffered an injury while drunk.the doctor (god bless him, amazing person) saw right through me and asked if i was ok. actually pretty much told me i'm not ok mentally. asked what happened to me, how do i feel, why do i drink. gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist (for drinking) and to a psychologist.it was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. it was way beyond his job description.i'm a bit sorry i opened up only in the most generic terms, but i was already on the verge of tears.unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if i'm giving all the signs. they get annoyed with me if i don't wear my happy face, but i can not bear to put it on anymore.god, i hope i can take something from this doctor and try one last time to fix myself, because i can't live like this anymore.
i survived my suicide attempt..
yesterday i had lost all hope and just went ahead and hanged myself from the ceiling fan.. made sure to lock everything so i can't be saved. as soon as i moved the chair under my feet i thought my neck would break cuz it was a high but it didn't happen, had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts like a bitch. half a min in i went unconscious due to the severe pain, woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood( i don't remember how long i did stay that way but apparently not long enough). had a long talk with my parents and tbh i feel very relieved as if the past me did die, i'm motivated for once and want to make my folks proud! i think i'm a little elated i didn't go away. i'll work my way upwards from now! thanks for reading it all the way through, i think sometimes there's a little hope just need to find it, i think i've found mine.edit:- i'm 17yo, and thanks for the support everyone, really appreciate it!
i see why people don't open up now.
been feeling better recently, much better. met a girl and opened up to her, she immediately left my house. things like this can really scar a person. i care about you all, let me know if anyone needs to talk.
does anyone else feel like depression and anxiety ruined all their potential?
now i'm not in school, can barley make rent, have no friends, family gave up on me. it's sad. it really is a travesty 
i hate having to put away my feelings for 8 hours a day
go to school, put on a face, pretend that im all happy and nothing’s wrong. it sucks having to do this every single day. it’s so draining
i'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.
i've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. i got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. accidentally twisted my ankle. i got a cold, which i'm still fighting. however, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. not asking for advice, really just ranting. these are just a few examples.i had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. i tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. it wasn't as short as it sounds. i listened to her and gave her serious advice, though i know she won't take it because she never does. instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because i don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. well, thanks, i just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. we hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to reason. i agree just because i know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. i can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so i just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. after talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, i'm getting off work in a few hours, i'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him. nowhere did she ask me if this was okay, didn't ask if i was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since i'm at home, i never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like i'm a human being. i tell her i texted him and i was still recovering and needed to sleep. she didn't ask me what i was recovering from, if i was okay, nothing. just said, okay, night. my niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. she's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. a chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. my niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. my niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for keeping things going, so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until i promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. a huge reason i don't have kids is so i don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet i have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. mind you, i had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. i forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. so, i don't say anything and just let her talk. finally, she's like, i just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house. i told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a dui because he drinks and drives. she allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. i won't even touch how stupid that is. so, i get frustrated with her and tell her that i keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so i don't know what she wants me to do. she acts like i offended her and is like, i just called to vent, can't i vent, sometimes? i tell her that she can, but i'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; i'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, i'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if i don't like her very much, i don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. maybe i did make it about me, but i want people to understand that i am not a therapist and i cannot fix their issues and i'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. i'm not sure anyone is, tbh.finally, we come to today. my mother had to take me to the doctor because i couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. we're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? you really need to get out and get a life. i don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why i'm letting it bother me as an adult. i'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. she also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when i point that out, she brings it back to me. anyway, i tell her i just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, i don't have money to have a life, even if i wanted to. so, then, she's like, if you get a job, you'd have more money. i know this, but i have tried many times to hold a job; i cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. she acts like i don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. sometimes, i'm sure the main reason none of this works is because i'm around my family, but i never tell them that because i don't want to deal with that fallout. at this point, i'm just tired of the conversation, so i don't respond. then, she brings up how i need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. heavy eyeroll. anyway, i tell her that i've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or i fade out because nothing is happening. she asks me why i don't hang out with the people i met last summer. the two girls i met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. we hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so i stopped texting her and let that fade out. this happens too often, so i stopped trying to make friends. i tell my mom that i don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, that's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly. i texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so i knew she was available, i wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. i try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. unfortunately, i am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when i see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. she then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and i need to be more realistic with friends. what good is a friend whom i only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? if that works for her, great, but that's not getting a life or anything else. plus, i have a history of getting friends and then i become the therapy friend and i fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then i don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. that's not friendship, to me. and go back to my mom and my aunt. my aunt is mad at my mom for checking up on her at her age and, of course, i get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so i've been designated the go-between, but i never said i would be. they are 20+ years older than me, why am i even in this?i don't know. i'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. i keep trying to explain how draining it is. they obviously see i have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or i get advice that isn't helpful. my niece and nephew would probably talk, but i don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. what is it about me that makes everyone think i'm a therapist? plus, none of them pay me for my services. that probably makes me more upset than anything; if i was a real therapist, i'd probably be rich off all these sessions, lol.
depression has made me dumber.
after years of struggling with depression and anxiety i've noticed i can't concentrate and process information as fast as i used to.does anybody else feel like this?
i can’t do anything

i think the saddest people always try to make everyone happy because they know what it is like to feel worthless and don't want anyone else to ever feel like that
good quote by robin williams. story of my life basically. i'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.
i just want to sit on a rooftop at 2am and talk about life with somebody.
while cuddling of course. edit 1: i fucking love all of youedit 2: so many people in the us, no one is down under :(
depression is having no drive, purpose, passion, or commitment
i go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive. i am constantly worried about something going wrong. lack focus and passion for what i do professionally and have no confidence in anything. i feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig. toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues
i feel like my depression and anxiety has prevented me from reaching my true potential
i always felt that i could have been something way better than i am now. i am barely scrapping by and spend most of my time in bed often daydreaming about how things could have gone for me if i had done things differently.
these random spikes of happiness and hope really fuck you up after. nothing matters now.
you guys ever get outside, get that extreme spark of motivation like, “fuck yeah! things are looking up for me now. this world can kiss my ass because i’m gonna make it out of here!” then, what feels like seconds later, something comes and rains shit on you. it’s like nothing ever lasts. when the fuck are people like us ever gonna get a break? were shoveling shit all day, everyday and nobody fucking cares. but the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “oh no! you have so much to live for! think about x,y, and z! you can’t give up! things are gonna get better!” yeah, shove it up your ass. you’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when i’m dead and gone. you think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. good luck with that. i’m tired of being told to get help. with what fucking money? all just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because i’m so fucking shit at doing it without paying? what the hell is the point of trying? i’m stuck here, just like i’ll always be. just give me the freedom to take my leave. i’ll be happy then, but i’ll be decaying in the ground by then. ironic, huh? i wish things were different.
i got my degree!!!
i'm so happy right now i completed my ba degree and i got a high mark for it overall. those nights i stayed up paid off and i pushed through despite everything happening in my life. it was all worth it, i seriously doubted myself so many times but i did way better than i thought i would.edit: thanks for the support everyone i really appreciate it :)
i miss the person i used to be
i'll admit that even years ago i wasn't very happy and had problems, but i still miss the way i was back then. i still had things that made me happy, hobbies i enjoyed. and i actually had the motivation to do them! i could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. now i can't find the motivation to do anything.but i think most of all i miss how hopeful i was. despite everything i fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. and i've lost that completely. i don't have any hope anymore, i don't have any motivation, i don't have anything to look forward to. and i just really fucking miss that part of me
i want to tell people don't worry, i hate myself way more than you could ever hate me
like if they are judging me or don't like me, trust me i know. i hate all of those things about myself and more.
do you ever want a intimate relationship but know how fucked up you are so you just dont try?
i feel like they would run away or be disappointed once they get to know me. what the fuck am i going to do with myself? maybe i'll doe alone lol
you know something's wrong when you can't even muster the strength to play a fucking video game.
i just open up steam and endlessly stare at my library.
today was my 21st birthday
i turned 21 today. i live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. when you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. i just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. i'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. today i received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. in all fairness, i don't have a facebook and i don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. i guess i've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. but i think in not having a facebook, i've sacrificed my social life absolutely. anyways, i've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. there is not a single person who if i called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. i've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we to cool off, and understandably so. i've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( i knew from highschool) who i ended up dating long distance when we started college. today, i made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but i haven't heard from her. it really breaks my heart that i lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. i assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. i certainly didn't forget hers. anyways, if you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. edit: the reddit community has been absolutely amazing. you guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, i've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if i was still feeling down. you guys are unbelievable. you turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays i've ever had. from the bottom of my heart, thank you. for all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. i can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. 
anyone else feel like they've lost their identity?
i used to be able to actually do stuff. even if i didn't want to, i went to bed early. i got up in the morning. i had hobbies and sustainable goals. i worked on my problems and found solutions.that was 6 years ago. now, i want nothing but to get better, but i just keep being my own worst enemy. i want to get a job. i'm 23 and have absolutely no work experience. i paid $2300 last year to improve my grades and i still haven't read a single page. i want to, so why can't i just fucking do it? i have adhd as well, but that's been with me my entire life so i can't really blame it on that..i just have no sense of self anymore. i do the same thing every single day. i get up at noon, play video games, go to bed. there's just no productivity, even though i hate living like this. i always tell myself i can't take this anymore. i'll start making changes. what do i do the next morning? eat like shit and play video games all day.i don't know what the fuck i'm doing with my life. i'm not strong enough to get up and make changes. not consistently, at least. i see a therapist every 2 weeks, but i feel like he's starting to give up on me.absolutely fuck depression.
anyone else ugly as fuck and wanna die?
i'm a really short guy, with an ugly face if i grow out my facial hair i look like a sick dogi'm balding, my hair is thin my body is weak and scrawny, also my dick is smalleverytime i catch my reflection on the subway i just want to vomiti'm 27 but i look 47, also a khv but this one goes without sayingpeople don't even see me, nobody can handle my no personality and social retardationthis is so unfair, and yes i wish i was born if africa at least i would've died at 8
anyone else wake up and mad they woke up?
like every morning i think oh fuck this again. i can’t do this.
in your experience, is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person?
what i mean is that i constantly worry that i'm not actually depressed, that i'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that i don't want to put in the work to get where i know i want to be.so i'm wondering if anyone relates to that
do you ever wish you would accidentally die?
i would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes i wish something else would just do the job for me. 
i want to be left alone but don’t want to be alone?
so i’ve felt with depression for about 10 years now and it’s always so confusing when i push people away but still want them to care for me. instead of going out and doing things with my friends i’ll stay at home and cry. instead of reaching out to people i’ll think about how they probably hate me. whenever i try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all i’m doing is complaining. i’m just so tired of feeling like this. does anyone else feel like this? and if you have do you have any advice for me?
today i got a haircut, shaved, cleaned up my desk and walked the dog
small step for a man but a giant leap for my mental health 
so sick of hearing “you need to go out” and “put in some effort”
go where? i don’t like bars. i don’t like to drink too much. especially if i’m driving. where else do people go to socialize?? i don’t have friends or even know where to go to make friends. i try every opportunity i get it but i don’t get many opportunities because i have no idea where to go socialize. i’m just sick and tired of being alone 24/7 and feeling completely hopeless to change it. this makes me sad as fuck. :/
does hearing college is the best time of your life or enjoy being young while it lasts freak anyone else out?
because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. i wouldn't even say i'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this fomo is widespread. i've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because i'm interested in the event itself or because i feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and i hate all of it. i haven't met a single person i enjoy spending time with. even my academics make me miserable. to top it all off, when someone detects i'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time.
you wanna know the worst thing about depression (to me)
it's that depression doesn't kill you desire to want to do things, it doesn't kill your dreams and what you want in life, it just stops you from doing them. it's like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage (depression) locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them. i dunno but to me that's one of the worst things about it :p
i desperately want to talk to someone about everything but i really don’t want to talk to anyone about anything.

dae else feel depressed because everyone else your age is going out and living their life and you sit alone in your room every week
 people my age should be out living life and making memories but here i am feeling like shit in my room alone. every fucking week it's the same shit. i just exist, i don't live. 
whenever i have to do anything stressful i briefly consider that i could just kill myself instead

you ever just run out of social energy?
you ever be out with someone, anyone, and you just run out of energy to be social with them and just wanna go back home really badly? please tell me its not just me.edit: i just wanna thank y’all for taking the time out of your day to respond to this. thanks guys.
prison without fucking walls
i'm so tired of everything.
i wish i could donate my remaining years
to someone who can make a difference or at least someone who enjoys life. i thought i was getting better but this morning i found myself drafting a note in my head. i'll crawl back out, i always do, but every time it just takes a little longer. i feel so powerless.edit: i've had a few hours to meditate and distract myself, feeling a little more level now. i just want to say thank you to this community and everyone here. it helps so much with the loneliness. be gentle with yourself, please. you're a lovely person, you deserve kindness. thank you.
i took a shower and changed the sheets.
it took two hours but i did it !
anyone else feels like they are annoying everyone?
i get ill or upset over something? mum yells at me.i’m too tired because of work, sudden change in environment and social circle (went from having friends to not knowing anyone) and depression? sister thinks i’m being lazy for just not wanting to do something last minute on my only day off. or for not washing a mug and a plate straight away.i’m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? friend says “why are you so snappy lately” or “what do you expect me to do”. nothing. i just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.i feel like no matter what i do, i’ll always be annoying to everyone around me. i’m sorry for not being super happy atm, i’m just having a bad fucking time which apparently nobody understands.
want to die, but don’t want to commit suicide
anyone else feel like this? like it would be nice to just slip into a coma or die in a car crash. it wouldn’t be your fault, so you don’t have to grapple with the guilt of hurting your friends and family, but you want to be the victim of something and just close your eyes and let go? idk maybe i’m rambling but i don’t think i have the nerve to kill myself because i don’t want my family to suffer and look for answers as to why i did it, but i definitely feel like i don’t want to be here anymore. i guess it doesn’t matter if anyone replies to this or not, i just feel like i needed to say it somewhere; i want to die but i don’t want to kill myself.
anyone else wishes that they get deleted from this universe, every single memory of them too?
i just wish that i get removed from this universe, and no one remembers that i even existed. everyday i want to commit suicide, but can't do it because of my parents. i know they won't be able to get over my death. i just wish they hated me ,instead of loving me so much, so i could die in peace. i don't deserve such good parents. i am a complete loser.
reminder: no activism is allowed here at any time.
we know that september 10 was world suicide prevention day. and, we're all for activism. but not here, please and thank you. it takes focus away from our ops in need of support and understanding. 
theres a part of me that wants to get better, but theres also a part of me that doesnt
its hard to explain but its a feeling of not wanting the pain but wanting it at the same time, i feel like depression is very comforting, even though its not supposed to be, can anyone give me ideas on what this is?
if isolation is bad, why does it feel so good?
why do i feel even more inhuman when i'm with others?i don't want to talk, i don't want to smile. i don't want one of my friends to listen. i'm sick and tired of speaking, of explaining.whenever i'm alone, i might have moments of sadness, but i also moments of joy.when i'm with others, i forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like i am caught to spend time with them.i don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.i just want to be how i am. angry, sad, tired. and just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how i feel and why i feel that way.i don't even want help. because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that i don't want.it's not that i see my depression as a disease or illness, i see it as a symptom for something deeper. for the fact that i simply don't want to be part of this society, be normal, hang around with others. meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. i don't want to forget, because i actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.if your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.you have to see what's wrong and adjust it.and right now, every form of human interaction feels like i'm doing a marathon with that leg...
anyone else just super tired all the time
like no matter how much sleep i get i’m always fatigued.
after three months of almost crippling depression, i finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and i'm very proud of myself :)
i've been struggling with depression for about three months now. i've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but i started a treatment, took medications and got cured. ~~i guess depression never leaves, right? we just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. but i might me wrong.~~ but now all of this feelings are coming back and i'm panicking. i have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (i'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), i cry every morning and every night, i'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause i'm a failure, i get too anxious to reply to anyone, i'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...i tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. stop using the uber app to go to work when i can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where i can use wherever i want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages i've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so i can be more active, start applying for jobs (i don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (my roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). just simple things i thought i could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. but i can't. i literally can't. every time i try to get out of bed in the morning i cry 'cause i simply can't. i walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. sometimes i can even put on my gym clothes. i turn on my computer i just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. i'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.**i think the thing that's bothering me the most is that i can't achieve the simplest goals, and i'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **i don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes i just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** but either way i can't live like this anymore. i've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. it took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. my appointment will be next friday. i'm very nervous, but relieved. i really hope things get better from now on so i can have a normal life again. :)
depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.
this was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (we have this facebook group where we submit all our photography works)**and it just resonated with me.** depression is such an ass. struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that i ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. and i couldn't do it because i'm too afraid. i want things to end. but i couldn't. at this moment, i'm not suicidal. i'm not even at the point that i'm severely depressed to the point i can't function normally. it just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... the fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. the fact that i still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. the fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. the fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. and ultimately, the fact that i realize that its such a miracle that i'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.peace out, and much love.
i really need a fucking hug.
i need someone to pull me into their arms and just hold me for like a minute or two. fuck.
you don't know how much depression affects you until you have a good day
yesterday i played video games with my best friend all evening, and afterwards i laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier. i suddenly realized an odd, light, positive feeling in my chest. i'd forgotten how nice good days could be, and how giddy, bone-deep happiness felt. i hope this is a sign i'm getting better again!!
my dog just saw me crying on the back porch and started barking at random things.
she wasn't sure what was making me upset, but she wanted to scare it off. getting a dog hasn't cured my depression, but she sure has made it easier to deal.i love this dog.
do you also sometimes fool yourself into thinking you are not depressed anymore?
every now and then i start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything. i start to have all these ideas about how i will change things around and become a better person etc. just to find that the morning after i'm as depressed as ever, if not more. it's like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say psyche! you still suck.
i hate people assuming my depression is gone just because i seem “happy”
i always put on a fake smile and fake laugh when i am around friends or family. they always think that because i act this way that i am getting better which results in them not caring about my depression. the truth is is that i always act happy because i know they will just get mad at me and say i am being dramatic if i complain about anything or even mention my depression. i just stay silent and put on a smile.
does anyone else, when they're in a really depressed mood, feel like they're just acting sad to get attention?
i mean myself personally. whenever i feel down i automatically start shaming myself by saying i'm only acting like this because i want someone else to feel bad for me. but i know that's not what i want, or at least i think it's not what i want. idk. does anyone else ever feel like this though?
anyone else jealous of others happiness?
it could be over the smallest thing. whenever i hear someone talk about hobbies or anything i am just envious of them. i wish i could enjoy things, i wish i could actually have the desire to do anything. it hurts. i absolutely hate when people ask me “so what are your hobbies?” “what did you do this weekend?” shit like that. i have no answer because i just stay in my damn bed whenever i’m not at work. the other day someone asked me “have you done anything interesting lately?” i just straight up said “no, i’m boring” i hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me. and i get it, why would you want to be friends with someone like that? i don’t blame them. but goddamn i wish i wasn’t like this. its not a choice, i wouldnt wish this on anyone. it’s literally the worst. a curse. why couldn’t i just be normal and have a happy life
i just wish i could be asleep for the rest of my life
probably sounds stupid but the only thing i look forward to everyday is laying in bed after doing nothing all day and just sleeping for 15 hours. i like dreaming. i wish i could sleep longer
people who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* nobody replies.
update: so, i thought it would only be fair to post this update. while one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, i’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. one other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. pay more attention to the former.original post:seriously, fuck everyone. it’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. the rest of them are just faffers. capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. more often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.edit: it is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. i don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. people have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. however, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. edit 2: looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical, but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. a big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. if you can, please seek the help of a therapist. it has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i need/deserve from them. it can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. but please persevere if you have the means.thanks to everyone for your comments. i’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so i’m sorry if i miss yours. remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.edit 3: if you're in the us, uk, canada or aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists.
do you ever just hate the person you've become?
i feel like i'm not me anymore.just a tired, easily irritated shell of who i used to be.
i took my first shower alone.
normally my mother or aunt is helping me shower since i'm terrified of showering and usually am forced to bathe . i just don't feel like i'm worthy of bathing. but today i was home alone and i decided to shower today by myself . it felt scary but great. i usually am terrified i'll fall or drown or some weird crap. but today i did it alone..
i wanna stay depressed
things are getting better but there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to be happy, like i wanna stay depressed.
i hate when you feel slightly okay for a brief moment and your mind tells you that you must actually be a fraud and there's nothing wrong with you
i've been clinically depressed for nearly 2 years now, i never enjoy anything and never look forward to anythingbut i'm going to see foo fighters tonight and i feel not too bad at this moment, i would nearly say i'm excited.so naturally i start to think that i'm a fraud and there's nothing wrong with me if i am in fact capable of some sort of positive emotion. i fucking love depression. smh
why don't you talk to us?
my parents keep asking me this question.today i decided to talk. i told them about everything and i answered their questions.after i had talked they told me: you don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.i didn't respond. they said: oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!then they left saying:you can be such a dick when we try to talk to you.this is why i don't talk to you.edit: just read through the comments. thanks guys. it really means something to me.
i have been self harm-free since february and i’m proud of my self for that bit it wasn’t easy.
i had resorted to self harming for a long time. using knives were my poison. right now i am struggling so much to not resort to it. i need help.edit: wow. i didn’t expect this. thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. and for those who are wondering i didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. i took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. i might be getting into kickboxing. been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. it’s still not easy but i now know that i’m not alone. thank you reddit.
an old man killed my only way of coping with depression and anxiety
- be me- have chronic depression and social anxiety - only form of coping was cruising around in my car- an old man runs the red light- hits me and my car- totalled my car and sends me to the hospital - he lies saying the light was green- gets let off the hook by insurance- insurance puts me at fault because of the lie- old man gets away with hitting me- my insurance cost rises- i have ptsd every time i drive- i stopped driving- my dad drives me everywhere now- i feel like a big burden- attend therapy- insurance tells me to go to court to prove he’s lying- im scared to fuck up in court- currently writing demand letter to take him to court- i hope the judge knows i’m innocent- pray for meedit: thank-you for all the kind and loving words redditors. i’ll let you guys know how the court case goes!
does anybody else fantasize about just...disappearing? like taking off to a far away place, cutting off all ties that you have, and just starting new?
i know that's not a solution to depression, but it's something i think about a lot as well as other things that depression consists of. i just imagine myself taking off, somewhere far away, near a nice beach, and just simplifying my life. not telling anyone where i've gone, not speaking to friends and family ever again. just...disappearing. edit: some of you brought up the point that our problems are internal and not external. i know that, but that doesn't stop me and my mind from thinking of taking off. 
i wish my mom hated me so i could kill myself without making anyone upset.
i'm not fit for this world and wish i could leave without causing anyone pain.
i really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.
depression doesn't exist you just want to be special and quirky you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria why can't you just be happy? depression is just an excuse&#x200b;i think i've heard it all at this point. really if depression doesn't exist, is that why i lay in bed all day starving myself? if depression doesn't exist, is that why i leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? i didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  if depression doesn't exist, is that why i won't leave my house? do you honestly think laziness is the reason i was reported as a missing person to the police? if depression doesn't exist, why do i cry when i glance at myself in the mirror. why am i isolating myself from family and friends? why did i cut into my wrists? why did i abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?&#x200b;an open letter to all those people out there saying just be happy. that's cute. you've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. my dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. he also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. he just keeps me around cause i have some leftover money from school and he wants it.&#x200b;i've come close to suicide a few times. once when i was 16 and another time when i was 20. recently it's been on mind, as i'm hitting new lows, but i don't think i could ever do it cause i'm just so in love with my boyfriend. though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what i'd do. i don't know myself. it feels like i have no one, except him, and i know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships.
i’m fucking sick of my life but i’m too scared to die.
i just hate everything. i’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. every day i am forced to do things i hate, talk to people i hate, go to places i hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. lately i have noticed that i’m being irritated by almost everything. i just can’t stand it anymore. i hate everyone around me, i hate society, i hate this world, myself and my existence. i can’t remember the last time i was honest with someone about the way i feel. if i stop acting like i’m ok and someone notices i’m not feeling well, i’ll just say that i’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. it’s not like someone fucking cares about how i feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. i absolutely hate myself because i’m worthless. i’m ugly, i have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. i can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. everything has lost its meaning lately. does my existence even matter? if i suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. i don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. i don’t want to achieve anything anymore. i just want it all to end. i have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? but there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. i’m scared of death and pain. i’m scared of what will come after i die. and that makes me hate myself even more, because i’m such a fucking coward. 
the older i get, the more i realize i’m going nowhere in life and the more i hate myself.
it literally terrifies me that i have no idea what i’m doing with my life and i just feel like i’m losing it. i have no marketable skills or i’m too mentally ill to understand what worth i possess and every day it’s just this terrible feeling of life passing me by. i feel like i’m painfully aware of being swallowed by this deep, bottomless pit and i still can’t do anything about it. i wish i was better than this.edit: i wrote this yesterday when i was having a really bad moment. i’ve basically read all the replies and you’re all very kind. thank you all for your advice and especially for your compassion. for those of you who mentioned you feel like you wrote this, or you empathize, i’m sorry that anyone has to feel like this. it sucks.
anyone else feel like falling asleep and not waking up.
in laying here about to sleep and every night i have the mantra in my head of that i hope i never wake up. i don't want to kill myself but i'd rather just never wake up again. that way no one will be mad at me for dying by my own hand. that way i can't disappoint anyone anymore. anyone else?

welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. if you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the role model rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.we try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. the community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under community info in the official mobile apps. if you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fdepression). *****sorry about letting the last post get archived.  we've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  in the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under community info on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  i'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  please use reddit's report function when you see anything like that.  the exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  *  helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the op decide when it's time to go private.   * i'm here to help posts.  these are specifically against the rules.  * posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  you don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  for example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  **edit:**  i wrote this in a comment reply below but i want to highlight it here:  we enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. we think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. if you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fdepression) before you make a post about it.  thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  
why do people tell me being alive is special? this is life. mundane days like these from morning to evening until we die. there's no fucking transcendent spiritual bullshit crap. it's just fucking this!
i woke up a few hours ago and ate too many chips and too much chocolate pudding until i felt sick.then i read the news and felt sick.then i read r/popular and felt sick.then i looked at the mirror and felt sick.what's up with this crap? what do people see there? it's the same old shit every day. i'm not even hopeless i'm just annoyed because everyone is so delusional.life is more of this. locations, schools, work places, are just wallpapers that are changing. personality, clothes, haircuts, are just avatars that are changing. success is just reaching higher levels in the same shitty game. the emptiness, the pain, the anxiety, stays the same.life is stabbing you, hurting you, mocking you, and offering you ice cream. then people ask if you're depressed because you don't like ice cream. no, i don't like ice cream fucking hell, why don't you stick it up your...sorry, i just needed to vent a little.edit: i just want to remind everyone that this is a venting post. maybe it's not wrong, but it's also not a normal or healthy way of thinking. a depressed world view can be *valid* while depression is *still an illness*. it's an illness that can, in many cases, be treated. it's always worth to try to make life less miserable.
anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb?
i feel like i don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. i'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. i can't remember words very well. sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. edit: wow i didn't think this would get so much response! i made this post while i was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important! now i feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone. i'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, i know how hard it is. thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.i truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. we just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us. i wish i could hug each one of you individually <3
i no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone.
i used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, i no longer believe that. i think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. this was quite a blow to me. i'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment.
i hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.
people often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. play music, focus on school, etc. but the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is just as pointless. i work out and then i feel great and then afterwards, i remember my situation and my life and i feel depressed again. if it’s not resolved, no amount of “substitutes” can help. all these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.edit: wow i didn’t expect this to get so many likes. my first post with over 1k likes! i’m happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way.
i don’t want to kill myself but sometimes i want to stop existing.
i wish there was an off switch that could be turned back on at will, ya know? like a less permanent way to disappear. just get off the grid for a while but then come back once i’m feeling better. is it just me?
i never understood why the suicide rates went up during christmas time... now i do.
i've always had depression, for as long as i can remember. but this year it's getting a bit worse i might say. i'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, i'm numb and in pain. i'm here but at the same time i'm not, i'm not myself anymore. the depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. i don't want christmas to come this year.   i  have this feeling that i don't want to be here to celebrate christmas this year. people are nagging me about what i want for christmas... i have no answer, because i don't need or want anything and i don't want to be here to open them anyway. whenever i get a present from someone, i just feel guilty. because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, i just feel like a burden for everyone around me. i'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. the guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   i've told most people in my family i don't want any presents this year. they don't know it's because of the guilt. i'm tired of all the guilt! guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  people around me has been decorating for christmas these past few days, i haven't. i don't care and i don't see the point.  i don't want to celebrate christmas this year. i see no point. no joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   now i understand why people kill themselves around christmas. my lack of will to live is kinda scary. it's never been so deep and strong before. the fact that january is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. i don't want to live to experience january. i can't, i can't afford it. i can't handle it! oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. push it away, just push the thoughts away. cut, bleed and shut off my brain.   merry fucking christmas to me.
anyone feel like years of their life are like a blur due to depression?
i can’t remember the things i did since 2013. where did time go?
if i knew what i know now i would've just killed myself when i was 14
all this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. this fucking medicine doesn't help. nothing helps. i'm just tired of it.
feels like my only passion is just not having depression one day. what a waste of life.
[26m] anyone else just feel like their whole life is on hold because of their depression? i honestly have given up entirely on typical, conventional life goals such as finding love, home ownership, and a fulfilling career. i just want to throw in the towel already.
sometimes while enjoying time with my friends, all of a sudden i get very down and feel like crap. over basically nothing. how do i get over this?
it has happened more than once, usually i just try and get my mind off it and move on but sometimes it’s hard. what do you guys do?
the loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly. -- f. scott fitzgerald
this quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression i've ever encountered in literature. one of the few times i'm actually startled by my own reflection. just thought i'd share.i'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too.
“you look depressed” thanks it’s the depression

does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people
i hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. i've been depressed for past several years but one thing i've always had is my family which i'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare i not be happy with all i have. anyway i've purposely hid this from them because i don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. the fascade is exhausting. i've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until i get better. 
every time you open up about depression people always feel the need to invalidate it
it happens every time. they say to reach out if you're struggling but as soon as you do everybody lets you down. people either make it a competition about who has it worse, or try and tell you that you don't have real depression. another one is when people downplay your condition saying there are people who have it worse. for some reason it always happens with this illness. can this stop already?

i need constant background noise (youtube, watching series) because i'm afraid of being alone with my own thoughts. going to sleep is scary because i don't know how i'll feel in the morning.
just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort. it feels like i'm not entirely alone then. my friends can't really get through me and i'm constantly tired. in order for things to change i need to do something, but to do something i need energy... so yeah...i want to sleep the entire time and i'm much more exhausted in general, but i'm also afraid. will i feel better when i wake up or worse?
does anyone else wish they could die from an outside cause
like it’s fucked up, but i wish i would get cancer or have someone hit my car and push it off the edge of the canyon or something.a terminal illness or an accident would do the job and make it so that my mom wouldn’t be as sad.i just want to die but i don’t really want it to be my fault necessarily.
i don't feel like i have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.
i don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but i feel so distant from people that i used to consider friends. they never come in contact with me and i can't bring myself to contact them either, and when i do, it's often just short lived conversations or i end up being left on read. my main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. i feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. as for finding new friendships and relationships, i feel like i've met someone but i find it so hard to trust them and i feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. i honestly feel like i'm not even a priority for them but i feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. i don't know if i should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. i don't know what to do and i feel hopeless.edit: thank you for gold, hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers, sisters, and siblings get through these hard times
12 months ago, i tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the emt says i was gone for.. my body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts.
i took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.i passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. my housemate got home early and found me. i was admitted into the icu, spent my birthday, christmas, new years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ect.all i can think of lately is not messing up this time. it hurts because i’m a perfectionist, and i couldn’t get it right.
depression feels like a perpetual homesickness while simultaneously not knowing where/what home is.
the best explanation i could come up with when a friend of mine asked. edit: i'm glad so many of you could relate. keep on fighting to find your home. 
anyone afraid of messaging people back because you’ll just talk about depression and feel like the most boring person on earth
so you never do message your friends back and you start to feel isolated then you have a high where you talk to people again then a week later the cycle starts all over or is that just me
i really wish i could kill myself before the new year so i don't have to deal with whatever misery 2020 is going to bring
there have been like, at least three suicides on the tracks this month and i so very much want to be one of them...but as much as i want to commit suicide i don't want to commit murder, and it would kill my mom if i did it, so here i am facing another lonely worthless year. i'm so tired of this, i'm just so, so tired. i don't know why i'm posting, like i said i'm not going to do it, i won't do that to my mom...but i really wish this could be over.
the most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”
when you’re 18, you can make mistakes. you have the time to fix them. they don’t define the rest of your life. you have a decade + to build a life for yourself. there is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. there is excitement. life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you is the road you’re now walking down. and all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. i would give anything to go back and do things over. but there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. all you can do is turn off the game.for people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. they disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever.
does anyone else feel like there is a fog in their head they can't get rid of?
maybe this has been talked about in other posts but i'm new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain. does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) the feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). i notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv. (i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling 'normal', or even periods of time. but it always leads back to that same empty hole)i feel like my brain is broken, like i've been missing out on how everyone else feels.
i've told 2 college professors that i am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and..
i was quite shocked at their reactions. i sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. the first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. he too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. and the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. he was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. that was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. edit: i really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. i would like everyone to know that i actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. and it is doing wonders. hopefully i get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. thank you greatly.
this is not the life i imagined for myself
i was bullied in elementary school, and i always used to tell myself that it's only temporary, that life will be good later, like in the movies. all i have to do is wait until i'm 16, i'm gonna have friends, have a girlfriend, go to the parties and gradually get into life as an adult.i'm 27 now. no friends, no girlfriend, i lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. i'm no longer being bullied by other kids, i'm being bullied by my own head. every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.it doesn't get better.
my wife and 2 infant daughters were killed this morning in a car crash.
i can't go on. im after finishing a 26oz bottle of vodka hoping to numb the pain even a little but it fucking ddidn't work. im in a secluded parking lot in my car staring at my gun and ignoring all 100+ missed calls and shit i cant deal with it. im going to kill myself within the hour. suppose i feel like i had to write this down somewhhere.edit: please see update comment.
does nostalgia bring up your depression?
whenever i think back to when i was younger and happy, i realise that my life is worse now and itl never be how it once was.just found my old pokémon pearl cartridge in a box and looking at it made me remember how much i enjoyed life when i was 7, now i feel like shit
having friends and family that don't understand depression is awful
it makes me feel like a freak, and so unloved.
i've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.
so, basically, my school is crap.teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. i didn't think the students did, until today.there was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. so, i sat at the side and said i was fine not doing it.however, one of the boys asked why i couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell i'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said no this is a paired activityso he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if i wanted to go in his pair.he got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.it was the first time i'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest.
i almost feel like i should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now i’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen?
i feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  i would just die and i would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now i feel like i missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly i feel like i tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then i never went through with it and now i’ve given up trying on work and stuff) i don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality i did kill myself at the right time and that’s why i feel so wrong because i didn’t. who knows
i hate it when people criticize me for not doing enough because of my depression. i am literally trying my hardest. this is my best right now. stop comparing me to someone with perfect brain chemistry. i'm doing all i can. this is going to have to be enough for you because it's barely enough for me.

does anyone else actually want to talk about your depression with a loved one but then convince yourself that you’re just an attention seeking piece of shit that doesn’t actually have depression at all?
even despite an official diagnosis, i constantly think, anytime i want to share my thoughts, that i’m just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones. it makes me feel guilty the moment i open my mouth to talk about how i’m feeling. anyone else?it makes it worse that every time i talk to my partner about it, she always twists it into some underlying meaning that i don’t want to be with her. and i get livid that she’s made it about her. maybe i am just selfish and attention-seeking. 
my parents just yelled at me for 2 hours.
my mother decided to take me to the hospital tomorrow, so at dinner, i asked my parents which hospital we will go, father astonished, he didn't know we have such a plan. i fucked up.he started yelling: she's not crazy!!! she's not sick at all!!! she's normal!!! blah blah. mother yelled back, and all of a sudden, they turned at me. i don't need to mention the rest.i can't stop crying, i'm so fucking desperate, my mother uses my father's high blood pressure to threaten me, said if i can't be a nice daughter he will die from stroke because of me. i know, i know i've done nothing wrong, but i can't stop thinking about that possibility, i feel guilty, it's all because of my existence, i won't commit suicide tonight but i don't know about future, fuck, fuck.
do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive
and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol
*cries to self* i need help. *few hours later* what the fuck was i crying about anyway? *scenario repeats in a later unknown time*

anyone else wish they could hit the reset button?
i know the past is the past and i only have moment but i wish i could just hit a reset button and go back 5 years. oh how different my life could of been. the mistakes i made. it sucks. i've been through waves of depression but but deep down i've always thought maybe things will turn out but this is the first time i feel like that little dying ember inside me is completely burnt out.
the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what its like to feel absolutely worthless and they dont want anyone to feel like that.
r.i.p robin williams
depression for me is the constant feeling that everyone else is better off without me.
anyone else feel the same way?edit: thanks for all the responses, guys, for once i don't feel alone :)
does anybody else notice that they are becoming increasingly bitter as time goes by, but they can't help it?
i also feel like i'm getting judged for it and excluded from family events.
i just wanna fucking die already. i didn’t ask to be here.
i used to distract myself by watching tv shows to escape from reality but my attention span has gotten so fucking bad i can’t even do that anymore. why can’t i just die in my sleep and put an end to this miserable existence. i doubt anybody is gonna read this but it’s 3 am and i just needed to rant.
taking care of the most basic things when your depressed is difficult
like washing, eating, staying on schedule, and so on.. it just doesn't matter. i think i could go on not washing for a month if my guilty conscience didn't tell me to at least act like a human being.
i just went from a straight a student all my life to a straight f student and i still don’t know if i’m faking my depression
just felt like venting. no one knows how i scored, including my friends and parents. everyone thinks i’m effortlessly and naturally smart. i wish they could see how much i’m struggling.
i drew a comic about my experience with depression.
hey all. a couple of years back i had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. a significant part of my experience was apathy; i knew somehow that i was in a lot of pain, but i couldn't feel anything most days. when i could, it was anger. i isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.i still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. i transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. i still feel like garbage a lot of the time but i have to stop thinking that i'm *actually* garbage. i'm trying.anyway, about a year ago i tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/rf48c), and i just wanted to share it with you guys.
does anyone else wake up feeling fine for about 5 minutes before anxiety and depression take over?
most mornings i wake up feeling absolutely mentally content, then within about 5 minutes all the shit just hits me.a mixture of anxiety and depression.i feel that cozy feeling mentally when i wake up but it dissapears. i used to feel like that inside all day long.
do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?
i'm a sophomore in college right now and i am constantly surrounded by wise people... people who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... they were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. they were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. they were able to make friends without poor social cues.i had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then i never had positive influences to help me. my parents were so busy with work that since my youth i was always alone at home. i have trouble having fun... i can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. it doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.i'm too lazy to write this but basically i feel so bitter. i wish i did more so i could show off my potential but nope, i wasn't certain of myself ever. i'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): sigh.edit: i have something to add. first, i am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. we all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. i also didn't get to finish writing this (because i hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where i stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. i also hid my feelings all the time. when people used to say, you don't understand! it would hurt so much because i really did in some way, or so i thought. i had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but i was never very honest because i was always afraid of the consequences. i feel a little bit of pride i guess saying this but i feel like i'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until i can remove it completely. nowadays i struggle to even read sometimes, i just don;t have the strength, but i try.i do say though writing this was therapeutic because i am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading.
i enjoy being alone, but hate feeling lonely.
i hate that i am this way. i push people away, but then complain about being lonely. edit: just want to say thanks for all the comments. it makes me feel a lot better that others feel the same way as me and that we can all help each other out 
anyone else afraid of appearing happy in front of family/friends in fear that they won't take your depression seriously?
i've made a horrible habit of holding back the occasional smile or laugh because i don't want anyone for even a split second to mistake that for me being happy. as a result i continue to suffer more yet i still don't change. then i feel poorly about myself for manipulating those around me. anyone relate?
a friend told my teacher that i want to kill myself. now i'm in an even bigger mess
so that happened... i had a really bad day and told my friend that i basically have no reason to live and that i want to kill myself. she told another friend, and she said it to my teacher. the teacher immediately called my parents. now they're mad at me for everything. my friends are mad at me. my teacher is mad at me. everything has gone to shit...i just cannot say what i'm thinking, because it always hurts someone. i won't be able to hold it in for long. guess this might be my last week on this world. i hope that without me everyone will finally be able to get some rest
i. really. hate. how. it. come. and. goes. in. waves.
at one time, i feel all right.a moment later, i feel like i'm the worst (fill in the brackets) again.
open letter to my son
to my beautiful boy. my sweet, sweet little man. i’m sorry i’m not the best mum. i’m sorry i get so distracted. i’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. i am really trying. this isn’t anything how i pictured parenthood being. i am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. just know that i love you. i stay alive for you. i keep myself in my place for you. because i’m your mama. sometimes i feel like i don’t deserve you. sometimes i feel like i’m doing the worst job. sometimes i feel like i’ve failed you. i want to sing songs to you. i want to talk to you. i want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. sometimes i struggle to eat a full meal and i feel guilty that i don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. you cry. i feel ashamed. i feel like i’ve let you down. i wake up thinking “i don’t want to get out of bed today” but i do, just for you. because i love you. but why do i feel so hopeless? why does my heart ache for you every single day? my baby, this is draining my soul. the anxiety i go through just to get money for us. sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. mummy is tired. mummy is drained. mummy wants to be happy just for you. i want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. i didn’t want this for us. you don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. i am a terrible mother but i’m trying my best for you. postpartum depression is evil. it’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. i turn on my phone and it’s the only thing i’m glued to. i feel like the worlds worst mum. i feel guilty that i can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad i feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. you deserve better. my misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. not paying enough attention brings me down even more. you’re a blessing. you’re the greatest gift that i’ve ever been given and i’m guilty because i’m not doing my job properly. i feel ungrateful. i love you so much, my honey. i feel so helpless because i have no one to talk to. i get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. but it’s harder than it seems. i didn’t ask for this. i am trying my darling. i am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. i want to get help. but i’m afraid of being turned away. afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that i’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, i wish i could. time is so precious and i’m wasting it by moping around. i’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. you are growing so fast. in the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. no matter what i am your mummy. i feel defeated and drained but i will always love you. i will always nurture you. i will always care for you. i feed you. i do everything for you despite my heart ache. i do all of my duties as a mother. i am strong just for you even though i ride through all of this pain. you keep me going. this isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that i am trying my best to be strong. a mothers love is like no other. it’s true. without you i probably wouldn’t even be here. you’ve taught me that no matter what i have been put in this world for a reason. to be your best friend. you deserve the entire world. mama loves you, my darling.
does anyone else actually want to do something productive but you have no energy because you are so tired and lazy and unmotivated that you can't bring yourself to do it?
and then you just stay in bed and browse reddit and pointless crap the whole day and then feel guilty for procrastinating. but then you promise yourself to do it tomorrow or some other day and it happens again and the cycle just keeps repeating and you just keep feeling guilty again and again
i had a shower and brushed my teeth for the first time in 2 weeks today.
there was more blood than toothpaste in my mouth by the end but hopefully i can keep doing it. the pain felt good.edit: whoah that blew up...
i had a friend over for the first time in two years today
she literally left five minutes ago, i don't know why but i feel happy, i feel proud of myself. a few weeks ago i was so crippled by social anxiety that i couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, i worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. she got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9:30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours!  i can't believe i did it. i had fun and she said she had fun too. she even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. my mom cried because she was proud of me and i feel like crying too. we talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, i felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. for today, i wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, i wasn't the girl who lost everything when i was 13, i wasn't the freak who never talks at school, i was me. i just acted like myself and it worked? i feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that i did it, sad that it's over. where do i go from here? i have a friend now, that's good right? i feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? i just kinda feel good that i did it. i know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but i just want somebody to know what i did today. i feel at peace. i just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, i have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas ) and i feel *peaceful* for once. i think i'm going to read my new book now, i feel like maybe i deserve it. maybe i really do..edit: wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, i can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. i'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but i know you're supposed to say thanks for the gold, kind stranger so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! i'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3pointless edit #2: woah, i've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. as for the book goes, i loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called caraval for those who care. i guess this has a meaning because when i feel especially depressed, i want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, i really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)
doesn't it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time.
i feel like nothing makes me happy; even when i'm laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit i still just feel incredibly upset and depressed. sometimes i actually feel worse.
anyone else feel like they just aren’t cut out for life?
ever since leaving school and entering “the real world”, i have realised i’m just not cut out for it and honestly i wish i was never born.i’m in my mid 20s now and the thought of possibly living another 50+ years until i die of old age, terrifies me. 50+ years of anxiety, dread and self-hatred...what kind of life is that?
my mom was killed two weeks ago.. i don't know what to do
my dad died when i was 11 and mom died two weeks ago from an incident with a neighbor. we buried her yesterday. its easter weekend. my girlfriend wants to go to a party but i just want to chill. i don't know if its a good idea to go or not. shes understanding and will stay home with me. i just think its too soon to be around a party group. also i'm 28 so i don't have a lot of life experience.
does anybody else feel so calm during winter? fuzzy socks, soft blankets, hot drinks, laying in ur bed....i feel like i almost have a spiritual connection w cold weather. my dream is to move to a small town and just escape from big cities and stress that's going on in them.

alone and abandoned on my birthday
it's my 17th birthday today and first of all none of my friends except 3 wished me. at home my stupid dad was to drunk to acknowledge me and i am sitting here on my birthday in tears, feeling alone.\*edit: thanks a lot for all the nice comments, it is crazy how people on the interent can be so kind and it has meant a lot\*another edit: it is the day after my birthday and i woke up to like +300 messeges. holy crap thanks a lot i don't think you understand how much it has cheered me up! i will make sure to reply to everyone, but i don't want to rush it, but from the bottom of my heart....thank you.
i wish i could re-do my teenage years without my anxiety and depression
and in a different time period, prior to the internet being a thing. 70s or 80s maybe. i spent my entire childhood locked away in my room with a glowing blue screen.
i feel like depression has made me less smart
i dont think about much anymore. the things i do think about are unimportant.because of this, i dont have anything intelligent to say. im not funny or clever or smart. i probably seem very stupid and shallow and boring and i dont like this.i wish i had the motivation to find things interesting and not be so one-dimensional and dull.
it’s crazy to me that there are people out there who have never been depressed or thought about killing themselves
i guess i’ve just been living like this so long it’s hard to believe there are people out there who have never felt this way at all
i did it guys! not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but i cleaned my house!
i'm clinically depressed, and have been on wellbutrin for about 4 months now. it certainly evened me out a bit as i'm not as mopey, but when i get home i don't want to do anything but either sleep, or play video games. now i'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but i've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. by no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.i swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the christmas tree (i know it's may...) amongst other stuff. i'm going to go do some yard work now!i'm sorry, i really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks i have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if i told them how proud i was of something that should be a weekly routine.i actually feel like i can invite someone over for game night or something, as a lot of my coworkers find it weird that i never want to do anything at my house.e: wow, i did not anticipate the overwhelming support. thanks gals/guys for letting me know that i'm not alone. also, obligatory thanks for the gold kind sir/ma'ame2: ayy, y'all threw me in the 100k karma territory, thanks pals. *proceeds to get down voted to hell*
just deleted a suicide note i wrote two years ago. i don't recognise the person in it, it's not me anymore :)
i was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, i wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far i've come. had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.i haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why i just haven't, i know it helps and i know one reason i've been feeling bad is because i haven't been. i just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person i was back in february 2014.
does anyone else feel like they want to die, but don’t actually want to kill themselves
i’ve been having this feeling for months now and it’s been making me feel even more depressed
anyone else thinks depression completely changed them as a person?
i'll just keep it short and say: nowadays, i do bold things without regard to whatever the outcome of it may be. all i say is fuck it and wait for it to screw me up.
some people have sexual fantasies, i just fantasise about getting hugged and being shown basic affection and it never happens
that's all. that's whats getting me down. i have a few friends irl, but i feel lonely, i feel unloved.
do you ever just lie in bed, thinking how different your life could be and imagining all the possibilities instead of actually going out there and doing them?
i do. i know it's a lot easier than getting stuff done and i wouldn't be able to get half the stuff i want done done anyways.
does anyone else just think “kill yourself” every time you do something wrong?
i make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so i end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. it’s like a reflex at this point. i’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. i’m afraid i’ll start saying it out loud or something
i have no passion for anything anymore
i don’t enjoy anything anymore. i dread waking up and i can’t wait to go home to sleep just so i don’t have to think anymore. i use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all i do is work, see my boyfriend, study and maybe see my friends once a week. my life is so meaningless i feel as if it isint going anywhere and i just feel so empty inside. i use to enjoy activities i use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever i do i can’t enjoy . i don’t know how to get out of this sometimes i can sit for hours just staring at a wall i am so dead inside
sharing something i’m proud of for a chance
the past two weeks i have cooked almost daily instead of eating fast food, i’ve kept my house clean, showered regularly, and i’ve done all of my work for grad school (even some of it way ahead of time). i usually don’t say i’m proud of myself but i think i need to say it today.
anyone just want to take a break from life and just go to a park on a summer night and just look at the stars alone?
that's all i want. i wanna go to a park, lay on the grass by the lake and look at the stars, alone. life is so beautiful, just wish i wasn't apart or this society 
i really miss feeling joy and euphoria
i wish i still felt that full-body joy/euphoria like i did as a kid. waking up on christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy i had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. i’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. the closest i get to joy is when i’m shitfaced drunk. antidepressants sorta help but i don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. i guess i will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time.edit: please stop suggesting drugs
nobody wants to deal with negative people
you really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers, friends, and family. if you’re not always a ray of sunshine, you become the negative, depressed person who is no fun to be around. at the end of the day, no one really gives a shit about what you’re dealing with. if you’re not being positive and smiling, no matter the reason, they have a problem with you.i wish there wasn’t a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing. it is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor.
does anyone else feel their life won't go anywhere?
it's the same thing over and over. i'm always physically sick and emotionally drained and i've gone through a lot since childhood. i'm just tired and hope for future seems bleak.
depression has made me so stupid
i can’t concentrate, i don’t focus, i miss the picture of concepts. overall i’m just disengaged and demoralized. i live the same repetitive day over and over. dropped out of school for the 4th time, can’t keep jobs, lose passion. i’m comically miserable. i don’t even feel like a real human anymore. i used to be articulate blah blah but nope. at this point i just drink a gallon of water and eat cereal that’s next to me until i have to move. no wonder my brain is rotting. hell i can’t even get through reading paragraphs on reddit. i generally don’t engage in anything bc it all feels like a chore in lots of regards. same fights
two days ago i was feeling amazing, the best i ever have and now i am miserable and want to die. wtf brain.
the last few days i felt on top of the world, had boundless energy, felt my depression was completely cured. was so happy, life was so beautiful, every thing was so beautiful. i was planning days out, chatting to people more than i ever do, making jokes, laughing. felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe. now i'm lying in bed tired and miserable because i painted my shed door and made a mess of it so i'm obviously a worthless human being. the idea of following through with any of those plans i made fills me with dread. i wish the happiness would actually last.
does anyone else feel like they either can't or are afraid to speak up about their feelings because there are many people that have it worse and you feel like you shouldn't complain?
i often tell myself this and it really keeps me from opening up to others about how i feel when i'm upset.
daily cycle

dear god. please make me not wake up tomorrow.
all life is is not killing yourself in the hope one day life becomes bearable. it never does. please take me away somewhere else. not dead so my parents do not suffer. just make me not exist. please.
i really don't want to die. i actually really like life. i just don't like my life.
i think the world is beautiful. there are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime. i think people are amazing, and the shitty terrible people don't prevent me from appreciating the good ones (whom i consider to be the majority). to me, life is wonderful. except i don't like *my* life. i wish i could be somebody different, somebody less mediocre, someone more attractive, more intelligent, more motivated, more adventurous, and more knowledgeable about what i'm looking for in life. i'm 21 and all i can think about is everything i have missed out on and will miss out on in life. i wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else. i don't want to stop playing, i just wish i could start a new game.

this pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. i don't still have any friends from then now. hell, i barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.i'm just so sick of it. i thought i'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. i'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and i'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?it just reinforces for me that i don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. that i'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups i never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. just...why bother? if nobody can love me for the real me, and i can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?edit: thanks for the silver guys, i wasn't expecting this to be so well received.
depression feels like dying before your body has died
after depression there is no more need to live, its as if mental and physical death went out of sync
my 12 year old sister attempted suicide.
she was being badly bullied by people at her school for the past 6 months, and yesterday she did the unthinkable and took 40 paracetamols. luckily she survived, but it's affecting everybody in the family awfully. i live in a different country to my family, and i feel so helpless that i can't be there and give them all a hug and tell them it'll be okay. going to try and get the first flight i can to be with them.she sent me a picture of her laying in the hospital bed, and she has teddy bear plasters on her skin. she's just a child. it destroys me that somebody so young, can feel so done with life. i suffer with depression too, and have attempted suicide in the past so i know what she's going through. i'm sorry. i just needed to offload of all this, as it feels like my head's going to explode with all the emotions going through my brain right now.
you ever been so depressed that happiness comes in short episodes that you know will never last?
dont remember the last time i was truly happy
this is pretty much my life.

when i'm alone i want people but when i'm with people i want to be alone.
i never know what i need to be happy. how do i figure out what my actual social needs are?
i never planned to make it to 15. today i turned 17.
a little over two years ago, i’d been planning to kill myself before my 15th birthday. today is my 17th and i’m actually happy i’m alive. i still have some very low days, but i feel so much better than i did back then. things get better, even if it happens slowly.
is anybody else here experiencing anhedonia?
it's the state of not getting pleasure from otherwise pleasurable activities.or, as i read once in a website thread about anhedonia, *essentially, i gain nothing from my daily life; my world is cold and, as such, it makes life seem the same way. everything i look at, everything i do, looks and feels the same.*.is this something you guys identify with? because i sure do. what's it like for you?
when i stay home i get depressed for not doing anything. when i go out, i get very anxious and later get upset over any mess ups during that outing.
i can't win.
anyone else go to the bathroom just to be alone and get away from everything?

my therapist committed suicide
last week my long time therapist committed suicide and i don’t know how to cope. i feel so alone. this wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. selfishly, i feel hurt and abandoned. everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. i don’t want to open up to a new therapist. the thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do i have?” and also, selfishly, “how could he?”  i know mental health is a beast and i know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair. like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. thanks for listening. 
how can you be depressed? you always seem to be happy.
yesterday a friend told me that. to be honest, when i am around other people i pretend to be happy as if nothing is wrong since i don't want to bother others with my issues. i don't really know why i am doing this.
my girlfriend died
hey everybody.i’m writing this to vent. about 5 years ago my girlfriend died. she died on the night of june 13, 2013 from a car accident. there was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. she swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.we met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. we met each other randomly i would say. we just happened to be in the same class. from 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). after 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. we still hung out with each other every weekend though. i would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. fast forward to senior year of high school. at this point we had been dating for some time. both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. we wanted to go for film/ photography. we loved each other very much. we were honestly just right for each other. we rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. we graduated from high school in may. unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. when she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. on the night before june 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. she really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. on the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. later in the day i waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. i txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. i just assumed she was busy. a little after 8 i received a phone call from her mom. i was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. i cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. it must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. i remember initially freezing up, but i could feel tears running down my face. the pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. that night i could not sleep at all. the next night i slept maybe a few hours. my life took a sharp turn when she died. i was so much more lively and joyful – i just became dull and lifeless. i felt lifeless as well. this is kinda random, but i never grew my hair out growing up. it was always buzzed short, but when she died i kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. my life spiraled out of control for about two years. i became a nihilist. i lost joy in life.i don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.fast forward to now. i’ve really came a long ways since then. i didn’t go to college right after high school. i couldn’t find the motivation to. after about two years i got myself together and attended college though. right now in my life i’m almost about to graduate from college. not in film/ photography, but i think she would be proud of me.i wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that i lost someone so important. losing her was like losing half of my being. lately i’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as i graduate. i wish she was here.   it feels good to write this though. for about three years i had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately i’ve felt the desire to do so. i hope someday i find someone i can love as much as i loved her.thanks for reading.        
a man gave me this at the airport yesterday... he'll never know how much it means to me to know a stranger cares 

why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?
seriously- i can’t tell even if i’ve known them forever. do they like me? or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. today is a bad day and i’m just obsessing over everything.
anyone else feel like they just simply weren't cut out for this world?
maybe it's just a sad excuse for where i am in life but it just feels like my attributes weren't geared to succeed in this world. it's as if i fall hopelessly short in nearly every metric that makes someone a successful and happy person.
you ever want to explain how you're feeling on here, but then as you're typing it out you realize you can't even articulate your feelings, so you're just like eh, fuck it and continue to bottle things up?
yeah, me right now.
anyone else have semi-suicidal thoughts on a regular basis?
i’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. i mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. it’ll look like an accident” but then i just shake it off. or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but i never actually act on these things. they’ve just become a part of my life. i feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that i have to constantly argue with. it’s exhausting. 
i hate being alone, yet i want to be alone.
id push someone away even if i wanted them to stay, because i feel everyone is better off without me.
we only see those who get better
aka survivorship bias. we hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better, but there’s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill. i’m tired of hearing “it will get better, just look at what happened to me!” because it hasn’t. why should i continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up? i call it as i see it. if my mental state has deteriorated, even after years of treatment, then i probably won’t end up as a survivor.
all i want is not to wake up tomorrow
i don't enjoy anything anymore. the hobbies i used to do just no longer interest me. the older i get, the less i enjoy talking to people. i havent talked to the people i used to call friends in several months. all i want is to go to sleep tonight and not wake up in the morming. so i can just be done pretending to be a happy, normal person. i don't want to kill myself because my parents and people would be sad, but i hate that the only thing i keep going for is so other people don't have to bury me. i wish i could get sick and die, or get hit by a car, or anything that would let me just be done.
does anyone else just want to disappear? not die, but just cease to exist?

millions of years of evolution among millions of species on this planet, all with a single common instinct within them :- survive. and here my brain is telling me everyday to kill myself.
if that doesn't prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us, then i don't know what will. i really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down, that too by people whom you would give your life for. fuck this shit, i hope i was born heartless and emotionless so i didn't care about these kind of people but i still love them even after they refused to help me. i hope i die a miserable death. it would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me. if i cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself, i promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this. 
depression will have you saying i'm tired cause i'm sad doesn't seem to explain how much it drains you.

i’m sitting in the bathroom at work trying not to cry
depression is a fucking bitch.edit: holy shit you guys are the most supportive bunch. i’ve been reading through every comment feeling more supported by each one. it breaks my heart that you’ve all experienced that same heavy pain that depression brings, but knowing i have people out there who truly get it makes me feel a little less alone. i fucking love you all, thanks for taking time to reach out.
is anyone else afraid of opening up about their depression because it sounds needy or desperate?
i try to keep my mental health issues to myself. i don't want to tell others because i feel like an attention whore, and i've been accused of that before. what about you?
i miss the old me
i’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. i’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. these last few months have been a blur, i can only really recall a few days in detail. i miss the old me, she had so much potential. she had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. now i can’t even move out of bed. i just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or i’ve pushed them away. i don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch netflix now. my housemates don’t even notice when i don’t leave my room for a week. even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. i used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. it feels like i have no one now and i have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn’t eat the food i gave him today because he’s so fussy and i just burst into tears. i’m so tired. i want out. everything used to be so different.edit: i never expected this post to blow up so much and i’m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. i’m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but i will soon, know i’m appreciative of every single pm and comment. thank you for making me feel less alone, this website is very special
what does a person even do all day?
i don't get it. i have so many things i could do right now - exercise, listen to music, watch a movie, anything - but i have no motivation. it's not that i want be lazy, no, it's that i have no inclination to do anything in particular and that i know i'll most likely feel disappointed if i do force myself to do anything because it won't be fulfilling and all i'll be left with is a confirmed inability to enjoy things. i don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but i'm too tired to be outside doing something. i'm just cycling between the same sites i check every couple minutes somehow expecting things to be different.what does a person even do all day? i don't get it.
anyone else feel like they're just scraping through each day to make it home and return to your vicious cycle habits?
every day i go to work barely doing anything and get home excited for the thought of being able to drink and watch movies in the dark in my room.  does anyone else feel too drained from daily routines to ever break the cycle?
who else envies people without depression?
i wish i wasn't born with this de habilitating disease. i find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive. anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it? for instance, i got promoted at work but it's so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position. other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but it's just a chore for me. and when i try to do it it's just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so i go off and do leisurely things. anyone have any tips to combat this?
the question i hate most: are you okay?
because the answer is always no but if i say no, they always ask me whats wrong. if you can see through my happy facade i'm nowhere near capable of telling you what's wrong without breaking down. if i am somehow capable of telling you, you won't understand and you will forever look at me through different eyes. you will always see my answer to your question written on my face...
high functioning depression is so hard for people to understand
people are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... i always feel like people think i'm lazy or i even question whether i have depression, i exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... but i had to cut my hours because i had a breakdown. i find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. i'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. i have days where i'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, i feel heavy and i kind of feel like i'm trying to run through deep water.but nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like i get through life just fine because i do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. i'm reading every comment and i'm trying to reply to all of them. thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as i thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.edit 2: still reading every comment! just wanted to share something that might be helpful. i downloaded an app called moodnotes, cost about £3? you can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. i'm not advertising or anything i don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day.
i had to fill out one of those depression tests today...
and i scored in the 'severe' range. this lead to the following exchange between my doctors and i.doctor: this is a really high score.me: thank you.thankfully, i saw the funny side it in it's awkwardness...and i hope you guys do too! sometimes, the only way to cope with how terrible things are is to laugh...stay strong, fam.
dae say i'm sick instead of i'm depressed because you know you won't get taken seriously otherwise?
it's ironic that depression is an illness in the first place, yet seems to be the only one that can be cured by willpower alone.if anyone knows where i can get this snap out of it medication i've heard is so effective, i would be so grateful if you let me know where i can buy it from.
i never realized it, but i always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because i never wanted them to go through what i'm going through right now.
funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me.looking back on it, it's kind of funny. no one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. the charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. a ridiculous catch-22, isn't it?i was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on.and now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. completely blank and hollow... it's as if my face has been wiped away. withered to dust.
my friend killed himself
he was 18. i grew up with him and he was like my little brother. he was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes. he was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh. he killed himself.  he didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day. he was exhausted and he only saw one option and now i'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself. i am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and i can't breathe. i feel too much while feeling too little.  i have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. but this. this is...overwhelming. it is excruciating. it is numbing. it is agonizing and yet it is impassive.  i feel everything and i feel nothing.   i don't want to die. but i don't know how to live.i'm fighting every day. i'm pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast. every day is a struggle right now. but i'm fighting. keep fighting, friends.
i'm not ignoring you, i just forgot about my own existence.
this is truly how i feel when people ask me why i'm not texting/calling them back.
do you hate complaining to people because you feel it will make them hate you because you are telling them your problems?

sometimes when i pretend to be happy i actually think my mood gets better
it's really weird. my friends in school have no idea about my depression and i like to keep it that way, so i always try my best to hide it and i smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes, not very often, but still  my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when i have a second to myself but it's just really weird. maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here.edit: it's crazy reading how many people can relate. thought i was being quite alone with that. thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. i guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days
always have this feeling of wanting to go home but i don’t know where home is

everyday i do literally nothing.
i lay in bed watching youtube videos everyday. sometimes i get up and watch youtube videos at my desk. i have severe social anxiety and no friends. this is my life. 
anyone else like to make themselves sad?
i'm currently sitting here laughing at myself because i'll literally put myself in situations where i'm destined to get sad by the outcome. i'm literally sitting here waiting for a text back from this guy as i refresh my following activity on instagram to see if he's liking anything so i can get mad/sad that i'm getting ignored. what is wrong with me ahahhahahahahhahaha
do you procrastinate even before doing things you enjoy?
because i can't watch a movie or tv show without procrastinating first, it's so annoying to waste so much time, yet i still do it. 
anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes?
i was doing great all summer. wouldn't even say i was depressed just a few weeks ago. but with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, i can feel things starting to spiral. particularly, i seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. my schedule is all shifted, and i'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. my mood is reflecting my poor sleep.i don't know if it's sad or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but i don't like it.i think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. it always seems like this stuff comes first. my mood issues are more insidious. i'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. so it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. i tend to get pretty deep into it before i realize how bad things have gotten.think i'm going back on the zoloft.

does anyone else’s depression get worse when it starts to get late?
i can be alright for the majority of the day, but as soon as the sun starts to set, i immediately start feeling overwhelmed by my depression. i’ve also been getting suicidal thoughts a lot here lately, without any external cause.
anyone else have no social life and just sits on the computer all day?

every day of my life.

does anyone ever wonder how normal/healthy people work?
i sometimes wonder how it would feel to function as a person, like how amazing it would feel to get a goodnights sleep and wake up in the morning feeling exited for the day. i mean is that even possible?
you know you are fucked up when you cant enjoy video games anymore
i am so fucked up that i can't enjoy any game anymore. i just wanna die now
fuck new years
anyone else depressed by new years.
i hate going to sleep because it means i have to wake up in the morning
sometimes, i will literally procrastinate going to sleep so that i have more time before the next day. because to me, the day doesn't end until i fall asleep. i don't even remember most of my dreams, if i have any in the first place
attempted suicide today. by stabbing myself so i can bleed to death
this is my 2nd time calling the hotline, i've attempted suicide an hour ago. this is supposed to be my final day, i was on my bathroom with a knife planning on stabbing myself so i can bleed to death.i was in the bathroom for an hour, thinking about should i do it not?i was supposed to do it but i thought what's the point of wanting end my pain if once i die i'll go to hell and i'm gonna suffer there aswell. so i didn't do it and went to my bed and cried.i called the suicide hotline, the call only lasted for 13 minutes because im scared of what will happen in the hotline.the hotline did a help a little bit but everyday i feel worthless, ugly, nothing, and dumb, i have a suicide diary so if the day comes that i succeeded suicide people can read what i've been through.sorry for posting here i just wanna let it out.edit: i appreciate all of the direct messages i've got. i didn't expect this to blow up. i'm sorry for bother y'all.i believe in the concept of heaven&hell i'm sorry if some of y'all got mad over this.yes, i'm a pussy... why would a person like go to reddit than get professional help, too broke to afford a visit. i'm only 16 so i can't really get that much money for a visit, my family never really believes  in depression.i'm sorry for bothering all of you. i really do.
our most-broken and least-understood rules is helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort, so we've made a new wiki to explain it
we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say pm me anytime in a casual social context.  we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  we're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  it will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.*****###summary###**anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (i.e. pms, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  either way, it's unwise to trust them.** pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer. and it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.* **by posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the op. if your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [the 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  * people who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** this is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  it's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  it's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. * **if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a pm conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch moderators to help**.  (contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police pms.)  * in our observation over many years, the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  community input mitigates these limitations. **there's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  if helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  *  we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  these people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.* if ops want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. although we don't recommend it, we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support. if you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them.
i showered, brushed my teeth and shaved for the first time since june of 2016
i'd slowly let myself slip away, and reviled in filth for the better part of the year. i don't know why i chose to do this now, but i've never felt better. 
i genuinely don't have anyone anymore
i don't have any friends who want to spend time with me. i have on friend but she doesn't care and i know that she doesn't. im not in a relationship and never have been and probably never will be. my entire life has been watching other people make friends, get into relationships and be happy. i know i will be alone until i die. i haven't hung out with someone in months, maybe even a year. i try to ask if people wanna spend time with me and go somewhere but they either say no or flake on me. i feel like the least important person in this entire world. i can't even maintain a friendship, so hoping for a relationship is unrealistic. i'm so sad and so tired of crying about this every single night
i hate that i...
...sleep in so late....stay up so late. ...never leave the house....never exercise....never go hiking anymore. ...never go to meetups....am so lazy....am so fat....have no self control....eat so much. ...am alone. 
my girlfriend died
hey everybody,on monday my girlfriend of 2.25 years died in a motorcycle accident. she was only 18 years old.i don't really know how to deal with the loss. i cannot speak to most of my friends. i cried a lot but now i just feel numb. i don't want to feel numb. i want to cry. i want to be sad.i don't know how to handle it.
depression makes me not care about anything, anxiety makes me care about everything
life's a b*tch
the worst thing isn't being alone, it's being surrounded by people and them making you feel alone.
my roommates having his girl over for a romantic saturday and i told him i could find someone to hang out with to give them some space. two days ago i texted cousins, friends, and co workers and everyone said they were busy. or just plain didn't reply. i shouldn't take this personally, they are probably busy with stuff, but ever since i graduated its like i've done nothing with my life and feel like i'm not interesting enough to hang out with. i use to have a someone once who i did could always count on and hang out with, but they cut me out of their life completely and i just feel like like such a loser. 
anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable?
i’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. i’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. if you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. ask me if i’m okay. ask me if there is anything you can do. don’t just make the statement that you think i’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. i’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. i’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because i’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. christmas coming up is so scary to me because i know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and i’m absolutely terrified of it. 
do y’all ever have those dreams where you wake up and you’re just so fucking empty because it wasn’t real.
i had a dream where a met a great girl and we had an amazing time. but later the dream kinda started to break down and i realized i was dreaming. i was so sad that i’d have to leave her. while i was fading out of the dream she just held me and comforted me. i’ve never felt so cared for, and wasn’t even fucking real. i feel fucking pathetic.
i hate it when you’re so depressed that even your favorite music doesn’t interest you. instead you’re trapped in your bed, in compete silence, listening to your brain talk shit to yourself
yup
my family searched my room while i was in the hospital
i don’t know if anyone will even read this, i just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago i admitted my self into the hospital because i did not feel i could keep my self safe any longer. the next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. and he looked in the box where i keep all of my sh tools in.  he then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after i was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. i didn’t even want them to read them even if i had killed myself. he freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. they then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. they took everything out of my desk. read though all of my notebooks. this happen last wednesday and they didn’t tell me until sunday. i saw my parents 3 times between the time they found the notebooks and sh stuff. they said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. i am really devastated that they read something so personal that i never wanted them to read. now i don’t know what to do. all i’ve done since i found out is cry. i feel worse now then when i went into the hospital. thanks for reading. i don’t have anyone to talk to about this. i just really need a place to rant. 
fuck all of this
i'm stuck at home. i have nothing to do. i have no friends. i have no reason to go outside. all my family does is yell at me for the littlest things (especially my mother). my physical condition is worse than ever before. every part of my body hurts. as soon as i start to break down or cry, i get yelled at even more. i feel like i'm isolated in a place that might as well be hell. i have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy.edit: thank you guys so much for all the kind words. and thank you to whoever gave this post gold. i feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles. it may seem hopeless now (it certainly does feel that way for me), but we'll get through this together. love all of you!❤️
going into 2020 the same way i went into 2019
fucking ready to die,and deeply alone.edit:wow. a lot of you feel the same. i say we abolish this holiday bs,make our lives a bit more tolerable. also,thanks for the silver i guess. that's a story to tell if i live long enough to.
i'm smoking cigarettes and drinking beer so that i have something to do with my hands. i lost interest in music which always been my passion. i spent the last 5 days browsing youtube, alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings.
i should look for a job but procrastination has taken a toll on me. my near future is uncertain and i feel unable to take responsible decisions for myself. i have to leave my flat in the end of the month. i will probably end up living at my parents again for a few months until i find something to do with my life. in november, it will be one year since i haven't been intimate with a guy and it makes me feel like i am loosing my femininity.i don't know who i am, don't know what i want, barely know how to get the things i need.
does anyone else just spend most of the day on youtube,reddit,twitter etc ?
i don’t have a life (haven’t in many many years,i’m only 25) i’m depressed and anixious all the time even when i’m watching youtube vids. i just spend the day in zombie like state scrolling through twitter or youtube.i’m just living through other people i’ve never meet. i’m just waiting for the latest news and drama. i think about suicide everyday. can anyone relate ?
how do you guys find the motivation to do literally anything?
i have no hope, i see no future and can't push myself to do the most basic of acts (e.g. brushing my teeth). how do you break through that feeling of the uselessness of your deeds? how do you find the motivation to do the things you want/need to do?
my wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids.
so um... i still haven't gotten over this. money isn't the issue - i have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. i can keep myself occupied in the morning. however, when its nap time its silent and lonely. no friends, family isn't available. night is the worst. it's dark, silent, empty and i normally cry to sleep. it's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. none of them will ever know her. she had loads of issues but i thought we could work them out. i thought she was better. i can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. i used to be able to read them but now i explode into tears and anger.   the kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. all boys. there world view is that everything is great. they smile everyday. i'm on paid leave to recoup.i'm so alone. if anyone at all could just talk to me please. even to just say hi i just need someone to talk to. i no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. i'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. edit: she is alive and at the hospital in stable condition.
who failed at 'everything' raise your hand
no, not the i recently lost my job, gf/bf, divorced, got cancer, i lost everything. no, you're not the case.it's not 'failure'. it's just losing something.what i'm talking about is, never been able to hold onto constant job, maybe dated some but couldn't manage any relationship, invisible to friends, socially awkward, never was pretty, never achieved academic/career success, who never had anything much to lose in the first place,would you raise your hands? i wanna see how many are there besides me.
my bed is my best friend
it makes me feel safe, it makes me feel at home. it will never laugh at me, i will never feel insecure or exposed or watched while at bed. i can cry in my bed for hours on end and never will it say mean things to me or make me feel bad. i won't bother it and i won't disappoint or fail it, nor does it. i can sleep on it which is the best part of the day and it makes me feel cozy and warm.my bed is my best friend and i love it to death
“you’re mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that”
yup... this is what one of my closest friends said to me when i opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year i actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. i don’t think i have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. it just makes me laugh now when i hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. like damn lol. anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? if so share it, i’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. 
i almost killed myself tonight
i know nobody will read this...i was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. but i never drank it. something stopped me and i'm not sure what. but nothing's changed. i still want to die and everything is still shitty.the only person i ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when i opened up about my mental health. just completely abandoned me. everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. i keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. but on the rare occasion she replies it's i don't want to deal with you, find someone else, etc. i fucking have nobody else. everything i've tried has failed. getting nowhere i'm therapy. i just want this to end so badly. why can't she care about me? about my life? i just need a friend in her. fuck my life so bad.
a stranger hugged me yesterday
i was crying yesterday talking to my professors because i was having an awful day. and this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn’t realize we were having a conversation. he felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. he was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.
life is a chore
having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *i have to do this all over again.* have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life. there are no questions to our daily duties, as we're following the propaganda of what others expect us to be. just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. we all supposedly have a purpose to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? where do we go from there?in my situation, i personally think i am not fit for this world. i suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. i have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. i lost the one person i loved deeply and now she is with someone else. there's nothing and no one left to live for.i hate going to sleep at every night knowing i'll wake up again, doing the same thing over. i hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain. i hate life and i wish i could give up and end everything.
it pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice
it just isn't. and not because i say it isn't. it just isn't. i try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better. coping strategies just calm me down. smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable. i don't even know. 
slowly, i didn't realize i was already killing myself
first i killed the athlete. there wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. he even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.next i killed the gamer. he was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. his antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. i just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.next i killed the party boy. this one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. i had to kill his connections with his friends. i had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. i made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. the party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when i went for the jugular to end his pain.next i killed the musician. i almost didn't like killing him. he's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. he has support your see. all the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. he's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. it was easy enough from then on. i'm just afraid, that eventually, i might kill the writer too. and when i do, i don't really know what's left.i'm actually surprised to realize that i've been hurting myself without physically doing so. i've lost more of myself in the past few months than i ever had in years. and i'm not making any more of me than what i already have.ps. i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. and putting what i've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain myself throughout the past year. i still get spans of time where i feel like nothing, where i feel afraid of being nothing that i'd rather just lose my life. but remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. so let's all hold on and hold tight :)edit: thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! and to everybody who's commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you, i'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through losing parts of themselves. let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. and for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)
people are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help. but you can literally be crying in school/public and people will just stare at you and not do anything
and then when you kill yourself they say they couldn’t have done anything to stop it. and they say they’re here for anyone who wants to talk. that lasts about a week. 
anybody else sick of the i feel the same you get everytime you try to discuss your depression with someone?
then that person tries to turn it 180° and talks about stuff that makes him sadand when we take our lives people say why didnt they speak because no body is ever going to listen.
i achieved one goal in 2016. i started brushing my teeth. for the first time in 25 years of life, i brushed my teeth everyday for an entire month straight.
i did it you guys. i'm so happy to have one small thing. i don't know how i'll reward myself since i have no money, but i'm definitely going go since this is an achievement and we need to reward ourselves when we do good. i  hope all of you who struggle with this know you aren't alone and aren't losers or horrible people or failures go being unable to donut on a daily basis. i know you're trying and i admire you for it. i love you all. happy new year! 
is it just me or does depression make basic hygiene & waking up super difficult?
ever since the diagnosis, it’s hard to get out of bed, including showering, socialising, walking (i’m not going to even call it exercise), vacuuming, combing, etc. my dad thinks that it’s laziness. he says getting out of bed & working out can lessen depression.
can't because i'm depressed, depressed because i can't.
anyone else feel this? can't work because of reasons raised by depression, depressed because i can't work.alone, no friends, no girls ever interested in me because of depression, depressed because i can't have those things.countless more
anybody wish they were 8 years old again and could start their life over.
i have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that i wish i could take back. my life is in shambles and i wish i could just magically start over. my laziness is the death of me and i constantly fight demons in my head. it would be much better to just cease to exist at this point. that seems very peaceful. life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting. i used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in 10-20 years i'll be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse. everytime i think i hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless. i won't get into specifics because there are too many to list but i am starting to feel like a pathetic failure. i always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but i just ended up becoming a no life bum. i wish i would just die while sleeping sometimes. waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world. just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point. i wish i didn't feel this way but i do. i'll end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system. even if one person reads this i'll he happy that i got this out there and could share my depression and rage which i kept bottled inside of me for so long. keep kicking y'all hopefully we can all be happy one day.
i don’t want to die
i just want to cease to exist.
i’m so caught up in my web of depression that i sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living.
it just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there?or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?how is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. it makes me feel so guilty for all the times i’ve wished to get cancer so i can die without having to do anything. i wish i could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so i can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die.
you ever wish you didn't have any family so you wouldn't feel so bad about wanting to kill yourself
i think about killing myself fairly often but i don't think i could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days i wish that i was just alone and no one was around to care so i could just do it 
i’m out
hi guys,i just wanted to let you all know i feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. i have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. whenever things go south again, i’ll know i have this safe space to return to.thank you all, and best of luck. you can do this. edit: i thought you guys might want to know what kind of things i tried and what worked. i took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, i'm now on paroxetine and they seem to work. i've tried therapists and that's not my jam. i spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and i hated it there (other patients loved it though). the thing that worked most for me was reading. i read furiously happy by jenny lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. also: the tao of pooh (i'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize i'm not crazy. and sometimes, i would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. i keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things i have to do each day. do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. stuff like that. and talk. and if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. and i'm here. pm me, i promise i'll reply.
does anyone feel like they're just overreacting and destroying their life 'intentionally'
even tho now i've seen a psychiatrist i still caught myself thinking why don't you just start being normal. like getting up on time and eating food and doing normal work isn't that hard why the hell can't i do it!!? i would hate myself forever if i'm jsut destroying my life because i'm living with a victim mindset.
anyone have trouble planning for the future and being impulsive because you think you'll kill yourself eventually anyways?

anyone cry at the sight of normal families?
it started when i was quite young. i remember being in a play park and seeing a girl get pushed on a swing by her father. i remember that gut wrenching feeling and tearing up. today i was at work and saw a mother cuddling her daughter and she said you're squishing me and the mother replied that's because you are so squishable and i love you that shit made me need to close for five minutes.
today i'm finally throwing away my suicide note
i've been a better state of mind this past year, but i think this is the day that i finally commit to it.i'm not going back again. i made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery, and i can do it again if i end up back where i was.i hope, if you read this and are suffering yourself, that you see this as evidence that no matter how long you've felt this way, recovery is always a possibility.much love x
sometimes i wish i could get killed so people wouldn't be mad that i killed myself. has anyone else felt this way?
sorry if this is the wrong place. i don't think suicide watch is the proper place since i don't necessarily want to commit suicide. i just want to cease living.i feel like no matter what i can't escape the demons i have. no matter how well i'm doing, my mind is always like the fuck? get back in line. no matter what, they'll always come back up and i'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. i'd be dead.**edit to add: thank you everyone for responding. you all truly helped calm me down. now that i've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, i feel better.****that too, has passed. this too, shall pass.****if any of you need an ear, or a digital shoulder to digitally cry on, i'd love to be there for you. shoot me a pm anytime.**
i feel alone when nobody texts me but when they do i just don't wanna answer.
it happens all the time.
there's people who don't have depression
there's people who wake up every day and are excited for what's going to happenthere's people who have a healthy social lifethere's people who have friends that care about themthere's people whose life isn't ran by anxietythere's people who get texts and callsthere's people who don't eat alonethere's people who don't hate themselvesthere's people who don't think about self harmthere's people who don't think about suicidewhen they have health issues you can see it. no one denies that they have a broken leg or a concussion and no one looks down on them because of it.fuck
anyone else's depression made worse by the way the world is?
i'm constantly so angry that i have to do all these things i dont want to do just so i can continue living, which i'm not even interested in doing.  i'm angry i'm in a major that i hate and that the fields i was interested in make so little money that the field isnt even worth pursuing imo. i'm angry i'm going to have to work +8 hours a day 5 days a week in a job i dont like, i'm angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i won't like. ill get shit benefits and 10 days vacation a year, so for the next 30 years i get to be miserable with the exception of 10 days out of the year when i can travel which is the only thing i'm interested in anymore. probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on youtube making millions for being morons while i have to go to school for 4 years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off.  i get the whole life isnt fair thing but i can't stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse.
anyone else get up, get dressed, and then just sit and stare at the floor or wall for 30 minutes trying to figure out why you’re even bothering?
then the fact that i wasted all that time makes me feel guilty and sad. 
does anyone else watch an ungodly amount of youtube videos?
it's most of what i do in my spare time. i dunno, it just gives me little views into lives i wish i could live instead of my own.
depression prevents you from doing the things you know will make you feel better.

i wish it were socially acceptable to tell your friends hey, my life is super toxic right now and slowly killing me, can we hang out sometime?

it’s 7am where i’m at and i’m about to go buy more alcohol
i don’t know how it got like this. it seems alcohol is the only way i can distract myself from myself. if i just blurr my mind i’m able to blurr the bad thoughts.update: i feel like some people didn’t realize that i had already been drinking all night then went to buy more at 7am. maybe that’s better than starting to drink at 7? idk. i ended up only having a couple of the newly bought beers and went to sleep around 8am. now i’m drinking water and watching game of thrones so i guess that’s goodedit: can people stop telling me to try weed? i have tried and i don’t react well to it
my bed is my safe place
i know this is the clearest sign of depression, but i love staying in my bed. even when im not tired i feel tired. when i lie down and hide in the covers, i feel like i  can avoid the world and the anxieties that come with it. as a result i'm so unproductive as well and hate myself for it, and thats why im in bed now.&#x200b;**does anyone feel me?**
do you guys ever quit typing your comment mid-sentence because you feel like your words aren't useful?
i want to help people on this subreddit with my experiences and pains but it's so hard for me to bring myself to hit post when all i feel is like my opinions and advice are useless,,edit: oh gosh ! i didn't expect to see so many responses on this. i really am truly sorry for everyone who feels like this. there are so many supportive people on this subreddit and reading what some of you guys wrote really made me feel wonderful. thank you <3
depression stole my education, it stole all of my friends, my motivation, my dreams, my future, my life, me.
edit: thank you to everyone who has responded with support, advice, or just simply sharing their story and how they relate. i'm not good at articulating my thoughts, so i haven't responded to anyone, but do know i read everything and appreciate it. 
i just miss the days when i’d wake up, get right out of bed, shower, then do whatever it was i wanted to do that day.
just woke up and this was the first thing that came to my mind.
does anyone feel like they shouldn't be depressed because of how good their life is, and thinking about that makes you feel even worse?
i feel my depression gets worse when i think about how i live in a nice house, work a stable job, and am in great physical shape. makes me feel like i have these things and shouldn't be depressed, but it ends up making me feel even worse. it's hard to explain
finally going to therapy.
after years of trying to bottle up and hide my depression i'm finally going to therapy to try and face it head on. wish me luck. 
do you ever feel like you are manipulating people?
whenever i tell someone about what has been going on with my life may it be friends or therapists, afterwards my thought always go to a rampage saying thats not true, you are just lazy. you are not depressed. you are just manipulating them so that they can pity you. i know its not true and that i have been very honest with them, but a part of me just think that. i am antagonizing my own self.
anyone waste time doing nothing?
i spent the last hour or two just switching between youtube, reddit and some other websites, spending no more than a couple of minutes on each. i couldn't barely finish a single video on youtube and i'd just keep refreshing the home screen for a bit, then checking reddit, then some other forums, then the game i'm afk in, then repeat again. it's too much effort for me to even finish a video from start to finish, let alone listening to music or even playing the game im afk in.anyone else just feel like doing nothing, feel like not wanting to live, when you are depressed?  edit: thank you for the reddit gold, even though its my first time getting it, i don't feel as appreciative as i should be considering the state that my mind is in, sorry
today, i had my first session with my psychologist.
it was tense, i talked him through some dark stuff. he showed empathy like no other and i immediately felt like i already knew him and vice versa. at the end of the session he asked for my id for administrative purposes. when he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?! of course, i couldn't care less if it was my birthday - i tend to forget my own age. however, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, i recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. it was the first time i felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. i couldn't have asked for a better present.edit: i can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. i've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and i've never been let down. recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart. *the bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.*i know it's far fetched but it applies for me today.
woke up wanting to kill myself. managed to go for a jog instead. fuck you, depression!
edit: holy shit! i never expected this would get so many responses. thank you all so much for your kindness and support, let's keep fighting the good fight and make depression our bitch!special thanks to /u/chaz91w for the gold, you made my day!
has anyone ever been eager, almost desperate to do something productive, but just so unmotivated to do so?
i feel lazy, i feel pathetic, i barely finished a project due tomorrow and it is the worst thing i've done in yearsi don't want to be like this anymore
i just wanna cuddle with someone and cry while he/she tells me everything it's gonna be ok
edit: wow... just... wow. i never expected this kind of response and i wanna thank you all a bit. after all, the only love someone gives me is from four beautiful girls that don't even exist (the main characters from rwby). again, i wanna thank you all and, as ringo starr would've said: i hope we get by with a little help from our friendsgreetings from spain (that's why my english is not very good)
told girlfriend i'm suicidal and got kicked out
finally confided in my gf last night about my depression and she told her mom and everyone in my family and then she said i shouldn't live with her anymore. i got kicked out and she won't let me inside to get my things. we have a 6 month old daughter together.i slept outside. it's 7 am now and i don't know what to do. i use her car to get around and now i don't have that. i also lost my job because she wouldn't let me go to work and i don't have friends or money for ubershe told me she did this to help me 
how do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?
i know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. it seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. they get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. but i can't seem to do that.the idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something i don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. it's only saturday, and i'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. this feeling gets much worse on sundays. and then during the week, i come home from work and know i have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time i don't have to be working. i feel like i spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. that's depressing to me. anyone else feel this way? 
you are a hero if you fight cancer and lose. you are disturbed if you fight depression and fail.

ever think you're over your depression but then it hits again?
just when i think i’m getting through my depression, it resurfaces and makes itself seem justifiable again. it makes it seem like depression is the final destination and i’m never going to get past it. i’m trying so hard. there’s not much more i can do. i could have the whole world and it still wouldn’t be ok. 
i just want to sleep forever.
all i want to do is sleep, but the thought of waking up in the morning and going through another day makes me want to break down and cry. honestly, sometimes, i have just from the thought of another day of just going through the motions.&#x200b;edit 1: well shit. did not expect to wake up to this post looking like this lol. thanks for the silver, and thank you for all your comments. this made waking up less painful.edit 2: this thing keeps growing so i just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responds.
anyone else afraid 24/7 that they will end up a 30 year old fuckup living at home working weekends single with no friends? i am.

just exercise bro just read books bro just go out bro get a hobby bro
i cant even move my ass to toilet,it feels life a lot of work and im tired of seeing these bullshit advices in every post i read. all i want is sleeping every day and die without pain if possible.
labeled as mature for being apathetic
at a young age i was called mature by those older than me, due to my lack of showing emotions. i thought it was normal up until major life events would happen, whether positive or negative and in between, when i would not feel a single thing except for severe apathy.
anyone else in a zombie like state 24/7
i’m pretty much a mindless robot who just goes through the motions of living more so then doing shit
do you ever feel like you are just 3rd-4th ranked option to people?
it makes it hard to even bother doing things. like what is the point? would anyone even miss me? 
i stay up late at night because i know the sooner i go to bed, the sooner i’ll wake up and have to start my day.
and in turn i get less sleep which makes my day even worse, great. thanks depression.
do you think depression has reduced your mental abilities and affected your decision making skills?
i feel like i am not the person i once was. i've gotten slow at making simple decisions. and oftentimes just confirm and reconfirm it with people around me to make sure i don't mess up.edit: wow. this really blew up. glad i'm not alone. though this is bad in a sense, to see so many of you suffering like this. depression is something i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. know that i'm with you...
does anyone find themselves just going about their lives working, going to school, etc then suddenly overwhelmed by the misery of existence and want to run away and cry?

went for 2 am walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.
after 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio i decided to take my one woman pity party outside. i let the rain fall on my face. i let it soak my sweater. i walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. i stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. i held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. i waked through the park. i got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as i could, like when i was a kid. i spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. i fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.and i know i will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. but i really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. happy tuesday.edit: just wanted to say how moved i am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. as hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. today was as hard as any other day, but i know somewhere i have the capacity to feel better. we all do. 
i really hate not taking interest in anything.
i’m the type of person who will really immerse myself in certain activities, hobbies, video games, television, etc. when i’m having an episode, as i currently am, i really hate the feeling of not being interested in anything.  i feel like i waste entire days just trying to find something i might enjoy doing, but it’s all been fruitless. it drives me crazy.  i just waste my entire weekend doing nothing of substance and go back to work on monday.
don't you love it when you're finally feeling okay and having a good time, and then a wave of loneliness washes over you, because you feel like everything you do is pointless, since there is no one to share it with
i'm so fucking lonely. i can't do this anymore
anyone masturbate as means to deal with depression?
i've been dealing with depression for a number of years now. i find masturbation as a temporary relief of that feeling. does anyone else feel this way?
i don't often see anyone mention the addictive nature of depression.
all the symptoms are negative; short temper, self destructive tendencies, constant muscle pain, sporadic tears. yet there's something deep in the abyss that beacons. there's an urge to indulge in all the negative feelings that come along with the disease, to be engulfed in it.
i feel like as a child i didn't learn how to properly function as a person, and now i'm just a burden as an adult

just because someone has it worse than you, doesn’t mean that your problems don’t matter
if something upsets you, bothers you, hurts you, makes you uncomfortable, then it matters. just because so-and-so has problems that seem worse than yours, it doesn’t make your issues invalid. it kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life, and the person they’re talking to says *well at least it isn’t any worse.* that makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because *obviously* my life isn’t actually *that bad*
anyone else feel like they have to try and fight to survive because of their depression?
depression is honestly on the verge of winning everyday but i'm still determined to try and beat it because i can't hurt those close to me like that. but it is getting harder and harder everyday i swear.
started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself
i've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (i'm 22f). now that i'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. i don't care anymore. i'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and i have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if i was dead). at least i will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. edit: i'm traveling from baton rouge. i'll probably just go through texas (namely houston and san antonio) for a week or 2. it's not the craziest trip but i think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. hopefully if it goes well i can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts edit 2: omg so many comments and messages. i can't believe so many people care about me taking a little trip. i'm reading through all of them and i appreciate all the tips and offers. i will update y'all after i leave (might be like a week) and will upload pics and stuff afterwards. one thing this has made me realize is how lucky i am to have the ability right now to pack up and go wherever i want with very little consequence 
so i bought myself flowers today.
no special occasion. i just had a tough day at work so i picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. what's the big deal? you're probably thinking. the big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of treating myself to anything just because filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. you don't deserve it. it's too good for you. you're not worth the time/effort/money. you are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. so now i really appreciate any small act of kindness i afford myself. yes, there are still days that i force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because i hate it. i love cooking delicious food for other people, but i still sometimes eat instant noodles when i'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. but today i showed myself a little kindness. i acknowledged the fact that i work damn hard and i am great at my job. i have value and i am valued. tulips are beautiful and so am i. i deserve to have beautiful things in my life because i am a badass bitch.edit: wow :) thank you everybody. honestly i didn't expect much of a response to this, i was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. i'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. you're all awesome!!! and to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. it was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today :)
life in this society is such a catch 22. people are always saying reach out, if you ever need me but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed. they either deny it or downplay your depression if they find out. or just outright see you completely differently.
so you put on a mask of happiness and no one ever finds out and you sink even deeper.
i just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! in 3 days.
hi i’m 21m and before this friday morning, i had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. no friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how i’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but i’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.i’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), i been going to places i didn’t thought i could find, i’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think i could do that. i’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but i’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but i’ve done it every time anyway!i’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but i haven’t found anyone, and i’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and i just feel so free!i lived in my own hotel room! like wow. to me it’s just wow. i been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. wow!!!” and freaked out cause i can’t believe i’m just doing this without little to any anxiety!? like hello?!i ordered room service to eat, even tho i had anxiety about it! of what he would think of me cause i’m alone in my room. but after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (self love right?)now i’m at my hotel room and tomorrow i just gotta eat breakfast and then i go home. (by train btw! i never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and i traveled alone cause i have no friends!)the clock is currently 9pm, i could go out and go to a club, cause i never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. i don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (i’m taking care of myself)this is more progress i’ve done in a friday-sunday trip then i’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.i’m so proud of myself!feels lonely tho so i kinda wanna cry, i’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if i had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (i’m gay)i’m so proud of myself. i wanna cry right now cause i’m going home tomorrow,i thought i would never say this, but i can’t wait to travel again! preferably with someone this time!i know this sounds cringe and i can’t believe ive done this. i’m so confused why i don’t have panic attacks and stuff! but if i can do it, you can do it too. it really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. i gotta go to x to eat and i gotta go see y and i gotta go check what train i’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.i know that when i get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. but this was, i gonna say it super fun! i haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!i feel alive.// anton
in 8 days i have lost my job, my girlfriend left me and i’ve diagnosed with cancer.
i feel so overwhelmingly sad. my whole life has crumbled so quickly. i’ve lost my job because i can’t focus at work. i can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. my girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, i am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what i will do on my own. the cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. i have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. i don’t know what to do. i feel like i want to sleep, but i can’t. i want to be numb to all this. to make the pain stop but i can’t. all i do is cry constantly, i just don’t know what to do.edit:  oh my goodness. i went to sleep last night, finally. woke up and saw the absolute outpour of messages on here. you guys are unbelievable. i can’t even begin to describe my gratitude that people who don’t know me would spend time sending such thoughtful messages. i love every single one of you. thank you so much.
i just don't do anything
i never felt like i was depressed, but recently i just have not been doing anything... my days look like this: wake up, lay in bed, go to sleep, repeat process...&#x200b;i rarely have any motivation to do anything, and when i do it's something like browsing social media or going to the shower or getting some food - basically doing stuff that just helps me sustain.&#x200b;i have no goals, no passion, nothing that motivates me to get out of bed and do something.&#x200b;i know that many people in this subreddit feel the same way, but i just wanted to let it all out to the people that can relate
i'm so useless and do nothing all day.
im 32 male living in liverpool and so unbelievabley useless.i sit at home all day have no friends.i moved to a place where i don't know anyone.i do nothing all day long apart from going to the gym. i only go to the gym because i'm a lazy fuck and give my self some pain and suffering for how useless i am. i'm unemployed because i have mental issues where i don't give a damm if i die or not and a risk from losing it everyday and wouldn't turn up to work if im not feeling good.i try to date but can only blag it for so long till my real self comes out that i'm nothing and not worth being in a relationship with. im to much of a coward to commit suicide but hate living. the more i try to self improve the more i end up not caring about anything.i don't trust people and people waste my time always. i tried to believe in god went to church quite a lot but feel like it's for delousonal people. and not one thing changed within myself. i'm just sitting here watching shit on netflix wasting my time knowing i'm a waste of space and oxygen hoping i die of a heart attack.33 years of depression since i was born. everyone says your life will work out you'll be happy in the future. and time has been ticking on and passing nothing has changed.welcome to a life of depression.and thanks to some incompetent waste of space of a man and women for not wrapping up before fornicating like animals.
you ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?
i don't mean just general regret for your life choices. i mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.i don't know. i guess i'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again.
i don’t want to kill myself because of the grief for others. instead i wish i could just disappear and have nobody remember me.

i finally told my parents i was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.
they didn't care at all. i got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?.when i struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because you know they just put the parents under a microscope.i'm officially done. i don't care about these people any more. i told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and i so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all i got was a tough love talk about how i don't deserve to be depressed. you are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid. edit: thank you all for the warm and understanding messages, it made me cry. to those who have parents like mine, i'm so sorry. thank you so, so much. i woke up to so many messages, and i read every single one. 
nobody cares if you're happy or not, they just want you to function.
that's what i realized today. 
every night i think what the fuck am i doing with my life then wake up and do the same thing again
no control, no ambition, no motivation. just nothing. i really wish i could muster up effort to start anything. go to the doctor, talk to somebody, start a hobby, start learning something, but instead i do nothing and feel fucking powerless. if i do do something, i quit after one or two days.my life fucking sucks.
tired

anyone else's memory gotten really bad since having depression?
i forget what i did yesterday unless it's worth remembering, ever since getting it my memory has seriously deteriorated.then again is there any wonder when our minds are going 100mph everyday and full of worry. there's hasn't been a time in 6 years where i haven't had a tonne of thoughts racing.i'm always worrying about my future, or lack of it.
i finally came out to my close friends that i have depression, and now i'm being alienated because i'm not mentally stable
probably a rant, but what the fuck.this last college semester was horrible on me, and i came out of it with depression and depression meds. i'm 19m in college right now. i thought it was pretty obvious, but i wanted to tell my friends about why i've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. so the next time we're all together, i tell them that i have depression and that's why i'm taking meds and that's why i've gotten so quiet, ect. and... barely any response. basically just some oh, ok... like really? but it get's better.so the night after i tell them, i get a message from one of my friends, whom i was going to room with next year. the message said, and i can quote, that they don't feel safe around a mentally dark person in their house. ok, what? even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... and they don't want to, in quotes again, associate with a mentally dark person as a friend. like what the fuck? it's been a week and they've lived up to it. suddenly i'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. if i'm with my friends (i still try to hang out), i'll get heavily ignored. like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.i want to ditch every single one of them, but i honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. i'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, i 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers dark and unstable and unsafe. just needed to rantedit: also thank you for all the hug pms they really do help ;-;edit 2: wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. i'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. i'm going to try hard to make new friends. **i will make a part 2 to this in maybe a week or two, just to update what is happening because a lot of people seem to have gone/are going through this and i want to help them if i can with my current stuggle**edit 3: really thank you for all the hug comments and pms ;-;
does anyone else feel like their life has been irreversibly destroyed by mental illness?
i sure as fuck do.i don't know what to do at this point. suicide sounds like a very convenient option at the moment, but i just don't know how i would go through with it.i mean, what's the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons? it's exhausting and i feel mentally crippled.this has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement.what the fuck is the point?
what depression actually looks like.
playing a wow vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed.staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon.scrolling through your facebook timeline and wondering who these people are.earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food.saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack.wondering why you still have these problems at 30.crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship.never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they don't call you.
does anyone else get the feeling that everyone around you is living a fuller, happier, more complex life full of promise?
everyone around me seems to be doing better; like they’re happier, like they know something i don’t, or they’ve figured it out. i know everyone has their own problems, but everyone else overcomes theirs. i feel stuck; even when i make progress i feel slow, like i’m behind everyone. 
anyone else casually want to die all the time?
i would probably never commit suicide although ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems. 
i am really sorry for people who post here and nobody replies.
i think it feels like nobody in the world cares.
i think the worst part of being depressed for so long is that not only do you start to believe it’s “who you are”, the people around you do as well.
i am 21 and have had mental health issues since 14. i can say at 14 it started while 16 it hit scary/severe status.so with that age i’m around my family and friends because i can’t really get away from them. over time it has become normal to them that i never want to do anything. and even though it’s true, it hurts. i know it’s abnormal and i can’t stop it. this “fog” has taken over my personality. i thought i’d be happy when people stopped asking me to do things, because i felt bad saying no.. but now i don’t get invited or included because people just “know”.
i’m tired of being tired all the time.
i’m lying in bed exhausted. tried to do homework but i ran out of energy. i’ve been spending an hour or two in bed in the afternoon every day for well over a week now. i feel okay during the day but an hour or two after sundown i just find myself exhausted. i go to bed five or six hours early too wiped to stand, not tired enough to sleep. i get up an hour or two before bedtime to just fiddle my thumbs in the little to no time i have left.this is weird for me. i used to be like this after a stressful work day but now it’s everyday even on otherwise good days. it makes me so furious that i can’t do anything. i have school, i want to paint and make little indie games but in the little time off i have to hone these skills, i’m stuck paralyzed. fuck depression. depression is a little bitch.
im going to a mental hospital and now i feel like im not depressed enough.
i feel unmotivated, lonely and like i don't have a goal in life. massive guilt has been pushing me down for two years now. i've thought about harming and killing myself multiple times. but lately, since i know i'm getting hospitalized, i feel like i don't deserve to go there. i've never actually harmed myself or attemted suicide and i feel like i'm taking away a spot in that hospital from someone, whos problems are way worse... i definately know that i have thoughts from time to time, which are extremely bad and sometimes make me suicidal, but they always go away at some point. it's so hard for me to know if i'm depressed. i always feel like i can't say i'm depressed, because there are probably others, who feel way worse and would laugh at my problems...
every time i wake up from sleeping i’m just like *sigh* “fuck.”
or sometimes i’ll be doing anything and i stop for a second and i’m say under my breath “fuck i hate my life dude.”
therapy just made me more aware of how isolated i feel because most people suck at empathy
i’ve been in therapy for years. in that i’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and i try to deal with it. i spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. for a depressed person i manage to excel in life.currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. went on vacation to asia and ex broke nc before my trip to wish me well after what i gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.i’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. a lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.my sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. wasn’t enough that i liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. nope. only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.i was livid. i had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all i could think is “wow, people only care about me when i can offer them something.”creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill i can do people rarely give a fuck about me.i didn’t want to share this, and told her i needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until i cried at a shrine. i told her why i was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. i turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when i asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.i literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.i didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.i didn’t need to pretend i wasn’t upset.i just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing i want is a little goddamn empathy.my family rarely thanks me for things. they don’t care unless i’m in crisis or isolating. i’ve learned to ask for what i need but it doesn’t matter because unless i have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.i am happy for my sister. i truly am. but jfc i am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless i act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.i am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. i’m part of this family too.tl;dr depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. talking through issues got me yelled at...edit : whoa...thanks for the gold. didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like mei know it’s hard and i know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. well get through it
i've showered every day for 5 days.
i know that this is probably pathetic, but my depression got very bad and i didn't shower for months, now i'm back on track, going to try and keep going in every day now.sorry if i bothered you.
when i talk about myself, i feel selfish. when i ask others questions about themselves, i'm sad because they don't ask me questions back.
f*ck this... not having a single true friend that genuinely cares really sucks...
i’m going to kill myself
maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in ten years, but i have a burning feeling inside of me that my life will end on my own terms, when i am ready, and i don’t know how i feel about it. 
i hate that time is passing so fast, and i'm still the same depressed shit.
i seriously want a change in my life. in terms of my social life, love life, everything... it's been 3 years i'm trying to find a change and yet i'm still the same. for 3 years i am the same shitty person, and still counting...i want this to end.
anyone else feel like they're just trying to survive rather than live life?
during a conversation with a friend i came to the realization that in my existence i don't feel like i'm trying to live life. i i feel like i'm more trying to survive, just get through each day without collapsing mentally.  anyone else? edit: thank you guys for the response. i'm sorry that people feel this way, but i take solace in the fact that i'm not alone.
i can’t believe there’s barely 1 month left in 2017...time flies when your life is falling apart

if the moods of normal people fall between happy and sad, the moods of depressed people fall between distracted and miserable.
some days i'm pretty okay. well, not really okay. it's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. it keeps my mind off of things. it keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. it's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. you know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. and that in itself is a massive fucking success.
i am 58 m. seems to be most subscribers are young.
just like the title says i am 58 m.i visit r/depression every day and start by clicking new. while reading the posts i am always looking for those in my age bracket. which is few and far between. my depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. when i first visited my therapist (about 6 weeks ago) i typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. it wasn't pretty. went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......lost house, broke, in debt, irs issues, depressed mother f-er.the issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and not being proactive. before, i always took the initiative and created opportunity. slowly but surely i lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. so, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. i care about what they write because i have 2 children (30, 25). and i hope they never experience what we are going through.but, i still read every new post, because i hope to find the answer to my condition. ok, time to go and look at the pile of important things to do, and decide if i am going to take the initiative or go into my typical depressive state.have a good day. 
why do non-depressed people think depression is about being sad all the time.
i don't feel sad. i don't feel much, actually, if anything.
diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. all within a few days.
to my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.first, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. immediately i take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. next day, after the funeral, i phone my wife for emotional support but instead i get the divorce talk. unbelievable.all of these things were completely unexpected. right now i'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but i can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.i've never been depressed. i exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. but i don't think i will be the same after all this.edit: thank you for the support everyone. i can't reply to every comment but be sure that your words mean a lot to me :)
it's like i'm chronically lazy
whatever i do or tell myself, i'm too lazy to accomplish anything. even if it's something i really enjoy or look forward to, i just can't finish it. time escapes me. and then my parents come and yell at me for being lazy, and then i zone out of even longer, and the cycle repeats.will i ever be an efficient, useful human? i think not. i asked myself this 3 years ago. i have not improved. i have not changed. how does one change, when i can't make myself /do/ anything?
idk if this is just me
when i’m around my friends i feel like i want to be in their conversation i want to laugh and smile at their jokes and contribute with my own stories but i just can’t.  like i physically couldn’t even if i tried i always end up just sitting there looking at them listening and not contributing even though i so desperately want to. idk sorry
does anyone else procrastinate till the last minute and then feel like shit for not doing things earlier

i hate lying on bed all day, being unproductive........but it's the only thing i feel like doing......

i'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. depression is my self identity now and i don't know how to change it. planet earth literally seems pointless and i dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.
i've had depression such a long time and i too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   i'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which i'm grateful for - that is a success i guess.  but i'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. being stuck at this job (its the best money i can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when i leave a shift there.  i've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what constructive discharge means that is what seems to be happening at work.so anyway i recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing i've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  i can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like i can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit i need.  i have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but i don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like i had to do this one thing or i'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  it will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe i can heal faster, i don't know.  it seems like doctors where i am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now i can't get some pain meds when i legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.i really don't see much point in my living at all when i am just going through the motions of life but i'm miserable.  i can get by financially (so far) but i don't want to just get by while i feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  i hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  i don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - i guess they are happy enough with that?  i am not ok with it at all.  hurting my family is the only reason i am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  we don't get along so great right now but i would still never want to hurt them in that way.i gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that i have anxiety as bad as i have depression.  it's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  being stuck here i am not happy but i guess i am safe.  i shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.thanks
anyone else feel that their best days are passing in front of their eyes?
i’m in my mid twenties and i feel all i do is sit around and mope. this is supposed to be the golden age of people’s lives? i’ve accepted that i am different than other people who knowhow to live fully. but what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be. it feels like i took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet. like i am responsible for my sadness and there’s nothing i seem to be able to do about itedit: didn’t think this would get so much traction. been going through every response and at least i don’t feel this away alone. thank you so much for sharing. and thanks for the advice too. 
depression leads to procrastination and procrastination to depression.
please help me get out of this cycle.edit: thanks a lot for the advice guys. i am seriously going to try to apply all the advice i got from you instead of complaining or crying and not do anything like an idiot!
i’m a 14 yr old white girl diagnosed by a psychologist with depression
i feel like i can’t talk about it because of the «14 yr old white girls» meme...edit: thank you guys so much for supporting me, and thank you for tellling me your stories, i feel less alone now, but and i hope happiness will one day come to you! (i’m bad at english sorry) but seriously, thank you!
tried to draw how i'm feeling
might not be good but whatever.
does 2018 seem like a blur to anyone else?
i woke up today realizing how little of the past year i actually remember. i can remember bits and pieces but otherwise its just a blur.
do you ever wonder if you are really just selfish, lazy and manipulative person who convinced youself that you're depressed to feel better about it?
i felt like this very often lately. it's terrifies me. i keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? or is it merely a comforting thoungt i am desperately clinging to?(sorry for my terrible english.)
anyone else get depressed simply over the fact that their own life is so boring and repetitive?
this happens to me everytime i read a really good book/manga, watch a really good tv show/anime/movie, or listen to an amazing song/track. i get so engrossed in it that once it ends, i remember my shitty boring life that isn't going anywhere, and i just begin to cry, simply because of how benign and mundane my life is. i just want to escape my life to go to that distant place that i read about, watch or listen to.i wish everything existed.
i lost my personality.
i’ve just realized that i haven’t been myself for awhile. i used to be really funny but i don’t make jokes anymore, i’m barely personable and i don’t talk to people unless they speak to me first. i’m such a fucking robot and i didn’t even realize it. so that’s fun.edit: thanks for giving this post a lot of attention. it’s good to know i’m not alone
does anyone else just sit around and do nothing a lot of the time?
lately i’ve been feeling so lonely and shitty that i’m not really interested in doing anything. i don’t want to be seen by people, so i dont leave my house. i spend a lot of time watching tv and if i’m not doing that i’m browsing around online aimlessly spending hours looking at nothing. i feel like i’m wasting my life but i don’t know how to change.
has anyone else seen a significant drop in their iq as a result of their mental illness?
ever since i've had anxiety and depression it feels like my intelligence has just slipped away. i used to be sharp, in many ways i was above average even. nowadays, my grades are failing, i have a hard time keeping up with conversation, and new ideas are difficult. today, i tried to read a book and the words just felt so meaningless to me, like i just couldn't get the full idea. what has happened to me? is this common with the other people on this subreddit? 
depression feels more real - optimism feels like a delusion
throughout the day i'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. i'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. like i'm tricking myself. i'm always wondering, 'how long can i keep it up this time?'when the time comes that i finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what i try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. this is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. like cypher knowingly going back into the matrix to be able to eat steak. it just seems like a dishonest existence...and then i tell myself i'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. i don't really know why i'm writing this here. i guess i'm just sick of talking to myself. this somehow seems a little better. that might be another delusion... 
i socially isolate myself and then wonder why people don't ask to hang out.
it seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends. a big part of me doesn't blame them - they seem happy and for that i am glad. it's not like they haven't reached out before. they did, and i was guarded and made excuses not to hang out. nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. it must be difficult.a few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. i accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts. i saw tonight through her instagram story, several of them ended up going out anyway as a group - it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason.i'm not sure who i am if i'm such a terrible friend.  not sure how to make it better.
being alive is so exhausting

do you ever secretly wish for bad things to happen in your life so you feel justified to be depressed?
i keep on coming back to this in my mind but feel bad even thinking about it... does anyone else feel this way? edit: thank you for all the responses and thank you for making me feel like a less shitty human being haha. love all of you, stay strong. 
suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out
i mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? in my opinion, that's seriously low. they don't know what they've been through. how are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? everyone processes pain differently. even though it could be no big deal for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. there is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.sorry for the vent/rant but i seriously hate life... but i'm too stubborn to give up. and i don't want to be called a coward because of the few times i've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. i don't necessarily mean killing myself, but i've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. because depression is so hard to break out of. but i will always keep trying.
no one showed. i should have expected that.
i've only ever had one friend in my life. i've tried to make more, but people hate me. i've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. people just don't seem to click with me. i'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things i've been called. the only person i can call a friend is my wife. and i still do not understand how that came along. she just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.earlier this year, my wife discovered i have never had a birthday party. i never really had any friends to have a party, so i just never tried to have one. she said that was an injustice and i should have a party and invite friends from facebook.she decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. we planned it out for a month. made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. we even got rsvps back. it all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. i was hopeful coming up on the day. then the day of the party happened. we rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. the party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. no big problem. everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. i started to eat my snacks by myself. we got various excuses throughout the night. i got sick, stuff has come up, car isn't starting, no babysitters, my boss just called me in. my wife went to bed early. she was upset and mad. i told her it's ok. i am strong outwardly for her. i don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. but i am being eaten up alive. i am now in my 30s and i can't ever said i've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. i'm thankful she gave me a chance.). i don't know what is wrong with me or why i seem to be broken. i never should have had this party because ever since then, i just can't get it out of my head. everyone time i would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, don't say that. plenty of people are your friends. you're just being negative. now my wife truly sees what i mean. if i would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and i'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.edit: everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. trying to get through replies and messages. didn't expect this many messages. thank you all again.edit 2: i see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. i am very thankful for her. she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and i'm the best that ever happened in hers. we have been through everything together even homelessness. that being said, i feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. we are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. example: she hates the show *it's always sunny in philadelphia*. she hates it to a point that if i watch it, it should be on my pc with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. i do it because i can understand it frustrates her. but i love the jokes so much and i see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of iasip, but i have no one to share it with except the subreddit.
everything hurts
my heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.had a massive panic attack last night with my s.o next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. i cried, said 'help me' multiple times. i can’t do this to him. he doesn’t deserve it.now i feel numb. i don’t care about anything. i don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, i don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. if it wasn’t for my parents and my s.o i would have ended it last night. the worst part? i thought i was done being miserable. my last months were happy and bright. i felt good. but after last night, i feel like nothing has changed and i‘m in the exact same spot again.those panic attacks scare the shit out of me.edit:to every single stranger who commented on this post: i wanna thank you. your words mean so much, you have no idea. please stay strong, the sun will rise again. for all of us.
i sold my guns.
they originally belonged to my grandpa; i'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and i was a pretty good marksman. when he died, he left me two of his old rifles. they've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but i'd come to realize that i also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.my depression has been lifelong and i've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but i've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. impulses to do things i don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and i would fixate on the details of the aftermath until i would bring myself either to tears or to panic.what if i just went up there and did it? would my wife be better off in the long run? would the friends i haven't spoken to in years show up?this is shit i do not need running through my mind.two years ago i was feeling better. i was finally getting serious about art and photography again; i actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. then the grey returned, and i started seeing less and less worth going out to see... then the darkness came back and i became convinced that those things i used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.so, last week, i made a decision. packed up the guns, all the ammo i had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.i got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home i stopped by best buy and bought myself a fujifilm x-t3 for just around $2000.later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as i tried to think about dinner...what if i just went up there and--then it cut off. the pressure was gone. went up there and what? grabbed the camera i've always wanted and started taking pictures?i did. i cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.i've been shooting the camera for the last week and i can't put it down. i feel something; i'm really fucking good at this and i'm motivated to do it. my worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.it's always going to be a struggle for me and i know that, but i feel free in a way that i never really expected.-=-=-(also posted in /r/getting_over_it, if it's not allowed to post in two subs, let me know and i'll delete.)
does anyone else’s depression make them feel dumb? or...unable to focus on school work or semi difficult tasks?
information in class is difficult to obtain. as i’m usually having anxiety attacks and trying to talk myself down. if not that i’m just mindlessly taking notes. not really focused on what my professor is saying. when i look at a question it makes my head hurt. literally. i just want to put crumble the paper, shut my laptop screen, and lie down. as a matter of fact i don’t want to do anything but stay in my room. it has a full bathroom attached so my favorite thing to do is shower and watch netflix. i do have a few friends so they randomly come in and out. but i have no desire to be sociable. i’m a shit friend. now i’m rambling. helpedit: thank you for everyone that actually replied. means a lot to me :,) i’ll try to reply to everyone asap 
i disappointed everyone that expected great things from me
when i was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly mit. all my teachers were extremely proud of me. my parents were excited for my future in education. my peers thought highly of me. however, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a disappointment according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to punish myself. to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.
i am no longer a 21yo, unemployed, kissless virgin living with my parents!
i am 22 nowhow are all you other people doing today?edit: well, this got bigger than i expected. thank you for all the comments, and for the birthday wishes!
i procrastinate because i'm depressed, and i'm depressed because i procrastinate

anyone else find that, while you're super hard on yourself, you're almost too forgiving of others?
in my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that i'm worthless but that other people still have worth. i also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. because of this, i can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. but with myself, nothing is good enough. every decision i make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence. are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth?
casually suicidal?
is anyone else “casually suicidal”? like, you’re perfectly okay with the idea of dying and it’s just an average lingering thought part of your daily thought process. it’s more like thinking of ways to kill yourself rather than actually acting on them.
does anybody sometimes hope they get sick, so they can die without having to use suicide and disappoint other people?
i just want disappear but i am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it. suiciding also affects all the people who know you. why did he do that? did i treat him wrong. my parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal. getting sick in a way that i couldn't be healed and die would be like an escape from this world. 
dae feel like you're turning dumber as depression gets worse?
it's almost like you're charlie from flowers for algernon. 
does anyone else live in their own head?
i might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. most of the time i start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. sometimes i even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. it's starting to become more and more frequent and i'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when i realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. it's just so much better in my mind. anyone else?
why can't people understand i'm not just being lazy, i just feel unable to move
no i'm not staying in bed until 3pm because i think it's cool, funny or that i'm lazy. it's because i can't bring myself to get up.i'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice. this isn't how i want things to be. 
today i witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [tldr: a tv repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.]
the tv in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days i finally called the technician. he told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. he changed it and gave me the bill. i was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. he looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. it way dated may, 2013. at that time it struck me; i had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. i was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. i just can't stop crying since he left. the worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. i have been depressed since the past 11 years and i can't stop thinking how much have i lost in life. 
anyone else feel like they go through each day just waiting to go to bed?
i'm not sure if that makes sense, but i feel like i wake up each day just to wait to go to sleep at night.  i'm almost 27 and i just quit my job that i was overqualified for a couple of months ago because my psychiatrist and i came to the conclusion that the nature of the job was not good for my ptsd or ocd.  now i wake up everyday at around 3pm because i can't sleep at night until around 4am no matter how much or what medications i can take.  i also feel tremendously guilty when i get down because i remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.  i also feel like outside of my parents i have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff.  i have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.  nothing is interesting to me either, so i am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal.  i just want something to live for, and for life not to be so lonely anymore..
i've thought about killing myself for so long i've forgotten that's supposed to be a red flag.
i'm too chickenshit to do it though. i'm too afraid of whatever potential afterlife awaits me, and i feel too guilty about how it would affect some of my family. i dunno...the idea of suicide used to scare the shit out of me, but it's become such a mundane, frequent thing that i've become numb and desensitized to it. i feel like it's no longer a threat since i would have done it by now if i'd really do it.
you can never have an honest conversation about suicide
when i was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. i had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. the following events were an absolute  shit storm. my at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. it’s been almost 3 years since then and i’ve seen therapists twice since. the part i hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. when they ask “do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” i know i have to answer “no” because if i’m honest and say “yes. this is my plan” then i’m going to get thrown back into the psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”if i can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am i supposed to get any help. when i realized this i stopped seeing a therapist. even after she promised me to keep coming in. at this point i feel like i have to fight this alone. 
as of today, i'm no longer a depressed teenager!
...now i'm just a depressed guy in his twenties.this sucks.
this is how i tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:
when one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, i was at a loss for words at first, but then i remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. thought i'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.edit: thank you all so much. it means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.okay, imagine you're playing an rpg and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. you've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. it's called the cape of depression. it's completely op. putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. you put it on.and it's as awesome as you thought it would be. nothing can harm you. it doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. nothing can touch you anymore. swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. it's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. for some time you feel like a god. you glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. nobody can touch you. you're completely free.but the cape has disadvantages. it doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. after all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. actually you dont even miss them anymore. since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? so you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. but somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. it's just you and the cape. it's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. they never healed, but you never got any more either. then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. it's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. you need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.at some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? you're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. you are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. why do they act like they do? what's the point?you dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. the cape helps you. it grants you a +10 to acting and deceiving when talking about yourself. and you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. you dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.by the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. it has become a part of you. it's wrapped around you, around your true self. you are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. you've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.when you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. they only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. they cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. however all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. it's just you and the cape.edit 2: oh, and i while this was not in my original explanation, i feel that this should definately be in....though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: anger. you're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. you start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. you remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. for a moment you're glad. you feel. and then the next day it's over. the cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. but fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.
i hate it when people say that people self harm or talk about killing themselves just to get attention. of course they want attention, they need help.
how else are you supposed to get help if no one knows?
has your memory gotten worse with your depression?
my memory is absolutely terrible now, to the point where i second guess myself about whether something really happened or not. i can still remember information as well as i normally did. but for the life of me i cannot clearly recall highly emotional interactions (normally negative). i can replay the situation once in the direct aftermath, but then i’ll keep questioning whether or not i imagined certain things. the only thing i can confidently say i remember is on a scale of 1-10 how shitty i felt during said situation. little details slip away and i don’t trust my recollection of what actually happened. i always end up asking someone who was there if my recollection of the situation is correct and it almost always is, but i keep doubting my memory.
i wish i could just press a button and never have existed. everyone would forget me, and i'd just be gone.
i fantasize about this every day, but it's impossible. i want this more than anything else.
i spoke to my ups guy.
when i go to sign for packages i make a joke everyone he comes about my handwriting. i say please don't judge my writing   and he usually says it's alright  until the other day he went on to say. you love to sign huh? and he went on to explain why they require people to sign and how he doesn't mind my terrible scribble. he even smiled and told me to have a good day. this little interaction made my day. as soon as i closed the door i told myself i did good. i held a conversation. it's the little things guys. stop beating yourself up and focus on the things you've done successfully. have a great day/night.
every time i'm faced with some kind of challenge my first thought is i should just kill myself so i don't have to do this. it's pathentic.

i talked to a girl on campus today and asked if she wanted to hang out
she had a boyfriend so she had to decline but that's alright, at least she was upfront about it. just wanted to share this small victory i had today.
does anyone else want to die without committing suicide
for quite a while now i've been pretty bummed out, and whenever i am just crossing the road or on the top of a building i just envy that somehow my death could be accidental. or just wish that someone would kill me for no reason, i wouldn't say that i'm suicidal but i just don't want to be here anymore and it would be easier on my family if they thought it was an accident. does anyone else feel this way?
so i have this virus depression.exe on my computer...
about a year ago i realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. once i realized, i opened the process tab and find this program depression.exe running, hogging a lot of my cpu. i'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that i haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as i can tell it doesn't even have a function! its only purpose is to hog cpu and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.so anyway i try closing it, but nothing happens. i try again until windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. obviously i click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. i keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (psa this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. oh well i say, i’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow i’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.the next week or so i keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my cpu. programs run slower, and i experience more stutters and lags in processing. eventually i gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.the software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. i had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. i still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* cpu.some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “have you tried turning it on and off again?” “sometimes when my computer is overloaded, i just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “it’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. they don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.it’s difficult because i rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. when i first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. some days the computer won’t even boot up. i miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. i see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what i did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. some days, i just want to scrap my computer. even though i can’t afford a new one.edit: thanks so much for the positive response guys. i've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)
does anyone else feel like they’re falling behind everyone else their age?
i’m 23 years old. i’ve failed two years in a row of university, i’m back living with my parents, i’ve never had a job, i can’ drive, i’ve never had a partner, i’ve never fallen in love. i’ve never done so many things that people my age have done.i know that really, that doesn’t matter, and that people will say i’ll get there in my own time. but i get so down thinking about how the people i went to school with are so ahead of me, and i’m just stuck here, not even living, just surviving . i hate myself so much and i feel completely hopeless about my life. please let me know if you feel anything like this, your experiences, or even successes! ^that ^actually ^felt ^really ^good ^to ^get ^off ^my ^chest, ^haha
some people think depression/anxiety is just a way to get attention, but attention is the last thing i want. just leave me alone and let me die.

every time i try to speak about my depression, it sounds like a cliche. so i keep it to myself.
i have tried to write something in this group so many times but i always delete it (i've typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past, but haven't hit send)so fuck it. i'm depressed. i'm dealing with it in my own way. i listen to music a lot. it takes me somewhere. i just wish some songs were longer. i take codeine to numb myself quite often. i get a prescription every now and then, as i have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. haha. life's a cunt. i can't cry. i need to. i feel it nearly everyday. being right on the brink of tears. but there's nothing there. i don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel everything. every fucking thing. i can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. so many thoughts running through my head at once. every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. all at once. and yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. i'm nothing. and yet my mind tries to be everything haha. such a broken piece of shit. i think about hurting myself and dying a lot. it used to scare me. i remember the first time i genuinely thought about killing myself. it scared me. and it kinda felt good that that's how i reacted. but that was ages ago. it's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.insignificant. ***hey, thank you everyone for the response. ***when i typed this out, i didn't expect it to get noticed and i almost didn't send it again haha. i just thought 'fuck it what have i got to lose'. but i'm glad i did, i cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. people who have commented or messaged me personally and said that i hit a personal note to them. it means a lot to me, i'm sorry if i don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that i appreciate this more than you know. in the future i will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. much love.
anyone else feel like when they ask people for help that you are being a burden?
this is definitely because of my anxiety, and i know that i really am not a burden to these people.but does anyone feel the same?
my friends remembered my birthday
it made me happy, that is all :)
do you ever just look at people and think, wow, im a giant loser
i just need to know im not alone. im tired of seeing all these people better than me with more skills than i have because i wasted my life playing the video games and being on my phone. i mean right now while i cant concentrate in my calc class everyone else is taking notes and im just here on my phone because i cant understand the material and while everyone else has the capacity to study for hours on end for finals i cant focus for more than half an hour before i take a fifteen minute break. tldr: dae feel like a loser and hate life
what depression isn't.
depression isn't an emotion. depression has no cause. too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. i came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people i know, he won't mention it. he sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. it is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. though i'm depressed i am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. waiting.a creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. a storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. a dull apathy in waking. a sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. depression isn't an emotion. depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life.
has anyone ever had a period of being okay, only to crash back down into the blackness without any discernable reason why?
i struggled for a fair while, probably years. the last two months or so i’ve felt great, however since yesterday i’ve just seemingly hit rock bottom again, can’t see any positivity in anything, can’t motivate myself to do basic things. i’m trying to tell myself it’s just a passing blip, however i’m low key worried i’m going back to the bad place, anyone have similar situations/experiences?edit: i wrote this and fell asleep shortly afterwards, i’m blown away by the responses. i’m going to read through every comment and try and reply throughout my day at work.
i feel like i'm drifting through life, seeing how far i get before i kill myself.

anyone else feel so nostalgic for the past when things were okay that it actually physically hurts?
even though i know i'm glossing over the bad memories....at least there were good ones as well
my girlfriend died and i don't know how to go on...
she had cancer and was 27.. we've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. we had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. we were faithful, devoted to each other. she was my oxygen, i was hers. she was my first and truly love. i've never been with any other girl but her.. i feel kinda depressed and alone.. we had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. i'll leave for our house next week, since i've been with my family so far.. i'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  i've got no reasons to keep on living. somebody tells me i should be glad to still be in this life. but as i see it, it's a curse, a damnation. she doesn't suffer anymore, as i am every second of my life now.. just wanted to open up to you...
does the idea of living the rest of your life just sound exhausting
like the past 18 years have felt so awful even tho i have lived a pretty decent life. i feel like there is no escape.
does anyone make drafts and ends up not posting?
i have a ridiculous amount of drafts here talking about how i feel. i don’t know why. maybe i just want the support of others who possibly feel the same or i’m embarrassed. i feel like i can’t go to my friends or family to talk about it. my family would immediately send me to a psych ward (i tried to od a few years back and was locked up). my friends would call me dramatic. so, i guess this is my stepping stone to post here.edit: wow it’s kind of relieving to see that everyone feels the same. but hey, let’s support each other?
depression: the disease that makes you isolate yourself from your friends, and then helps you be extra miserable later when your friends do things without you.
thanks, depression. i *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet i did it anyway because i felt i didn't have a choice. now that i put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that understand what i'm dealing with or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and i know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when i see the pictures or hear about it in passing. i know i can't expect people to still invite me to things when i always decline, especially now when the days that i feel up to being around other people are few and far between. the (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of. 
you're a goner - my therapist lol
during therapy yesterday, the topic of my past experiences with therapists came up. my therapist asked how many i'd seen in the past.me: 8, 3 of them in the past few years.her: ohhh..you're a goner. whenever i hear that from people - seen that many therapists - i feel like they're a goner. her: ...proceeds to sorta walk this back.... i'm pessimistic, but optimistic too. it was kinda funny. i mean damn i agree with her, chances are i'm a fucking goner and there's no hope, but aren't you supposed to help be building my optimism and hope? if i wanted to hear that there's no hope for me, i'd just re-read literally any of my journal entries from the past 3-4 years. i could't help but laugh about it later though.
have you ever felt so sad that you actually feel a sharp sore pain in your heart?
i feel so stupid. and so worthless. i feel like i try so hard and my trying is either unwanted or unappreciated. i feel like i burden everyone i meet just by being around them. i worry about all the wrong things never any of the right ones. sometimes i just want to up and go and escape all of the chaos. and other times i feel on top of the world. today i’m at the very bottom. 
anyone else here have no real hobbies/goals/interests and justs waste time on reddit/youtube/etc ?

i’ve had to stop my own mom from killing herself. i’ve had to stop her from beating me or my siblings. i’ve pulled her off my dad. she’s crazy. and it’s been like this for 17 years. thanks, mom (and dad). happy holidays.
my parents suck. i was in foster care when i was a child. so were my siblings. just some crazy ass shit we had to go through. i feel disturbed, sometimes.it’s so weird to know that other kids are vibing in their rooms this holiday break. i’m just trying to get my parents to get their shit together.
i don’t know if i’m still depressed. i don’t feel numb or sad, but i feel unmotivated, unfulfilled, blank and flat. i don’t want to end it all, but i don’t care if i live or die.
i can almost feel pain and numbness creeping into me sometimes, but it just goes away as soon as it came.  i honestly don’t even know what i want anymore.
yesterday i finally went to the doctors to speak about my mental health!!!!
he has diagnosed me with depression and given me anti depressants. also recommended seeing a counselor. furthermore, i went back to play hockey last night for the first time in 5 years. after a year of feeling awful, i am ready to turn it around.edit: thanks very much to everybody who commented such thoughtful, positive and kind comments. also thanks for the advice throughout too. the response made me feel so happy and like i'd really taken a big step. also thank you to the very kind person who gave me a silver!!!
am i becoming less intelligent?
does anyone else here find that long periods of isolation and depression makes their brains feel slower? like holding an conversation requires more effort and problem solving is a lot more difficult? even trying to formulate basic thoughts into text requires some hard thinking? i feel so foggy, detached and slow....
i drew out what my depression feels like.

i feel like i'm feeling less and less excited about stuff.
especially stuff that involves socializing or dealing with people
does anyone else feel that people only “tolerate” you?
i hate thinking this way. i have a few friends, but i’ve never felt i was truly “in” the group.  we “hang out” together, but most of the conversations would be other people talking. sometimes i wonder if they only take advantage of me because i would try my hardest not to lose them so i won’t be alone. do they really enjoy being around me? do they like me? i wonder...if i should find new people. but i don’t want to be alone.edit: waved hi to a friend. she completely ignored me. :/
does anyone else feel like depression has lowered their intelligence over the years?
i feel like after years of being depressed i've become worse at everything i try to do, i used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. when i'm studying i'l forget everything and even when i'm focused on reading i almost feel like i'm just staring at a blank page. no matter what i do i can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more i feel like i'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting.
i feel like i’m not as important in other people’s lives as they are in mine
i have very few friends, and even then i’m not really close to them. it’s very hard for me to make friends, and even harder to open up to them. i know they have plenty of other friends they’re much closer to and it wouldn’t really make much of a difference if i disappeared. meanwhile, if they disappeared from my life, i would pretty much have no one. i just wish i really mattered to someone.
hospital bills after suicide attempt
i attempted suicide about three years ago, and i'm still struggling to pay the hospital bills. yesterday, i received a bill for a charge i didn't even know about.it just doesn't make any sense. i wanted to be dead, but they forced me to stay alive, and now i have to pay them for it. plus i have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again. i feel like i'm literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills. why couldn't they let me just die?
why do i feel like everyone secretly strongly dislikes me?
no matter how good a conversation goes, i always end up so depressed and crying because i feel like everyone has a real deep hatred towards me. especially if i did something ‘embarrassing’...any advice?
anyone else basically waste all their time on reddit, youtube video games, discord, youtube etc etc all day ?

i took a shower for the 2nd day a row :)
it might not be much to most others, but it’s a pretty big deal for me. i normally go weeks with showering properly…
i created my first reddit because my boyfriend was drowning in his depression, and i wanted desperately to help him. since then, i've gained more insight and listened to all you beautiful people and because of you, i've learned how to better help him.
i'm not sure if this is right right place to post this, and i hope i don't upset anyone. (this is my second acct by the way, i wanted to create a new one yesterday for personal reasons) but the title pretty much says everything. i wanted to thank each one of you for being vulnerable with your feelings and helping one another, as you've helped me help the man i love. i hope nothing but the best for each of you and i hope this means something to someone. 
has anybody else been mentally ill for so long now that sometimes you don't even realize how bad it is anymore?

this is horrible, but... does anyone fantasize about ending up in the hospital, being bedridden for a while?
i picture myself finally being able to believe that my friends and family care about me after seeing their concerned faces upon visits. i picture myself finally having a shift in perspective which makes me grateful for the life that i have.i picture myself finally being able to do what i want- to stay in bed all day with no responsibilities.i picture my ex visiting me, and us finally able to work it out because my damaged health made us realize how short life is..
anyone else take days to recover from a insult?
every fucking time... first i ignore it and just brush it off then it pops back in my head and i'm stuck on it for days it eats away at me.. i manifest the insult and let it define me. the most common one is a insult to my intelligence, every time it happens i'm fucked up for a week.
attempted suicide last night. now i'm being guarded 24/7 by police officers.
so last night i got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. i took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. i would have chosen something more effective if i had thought about it more and i'm so mad at myself right now. i had the chance to die and i ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. i refused to go with them so then i got fucking detained and handcuffs. cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. i wish i'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. pills are not worth it man. probably fucked my liver up for life. oh and only one person has visited me. a friend. none of my family have so much as messaged me to see if i'm okay. i'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. how fucking dare they! i'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. i fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.update:i'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. i knew this community was amazing already but i've never made an actual post before (i'm using a alt account so when i shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) you are all awesome humans and i wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.so update on me if anyone is reading, i was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. they've deemed me fit to leave (nhs is very underfunded, i repeatedly told them i'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (i needed a 'safe space')i met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a b&b for the night in the lovely city of salisbury  (for americans/not brits this is near to stonehenge)he was beyond amazing. it's not usual for people to get a b&b but i was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. he even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me i was lovely. don't think i'll ever forget his kindness. i'm doing okay, of course i still have near constant suicidal thoughts but i've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. thank you all for your comments and love <3lots of love,jasmine 
anyone else feels like they would actually be someone if they were not held back by psychological problems?
like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.at the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.when i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.i think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (yay free shit.)edit: it's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, i really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :).

i’m a therapist- but recently lost my job to my depression. it was a personal choice, but i felt that everyone i worked with wanted me to leave. i have severe issues with self-doubt. i feel like a fraud, like my msed is not legit, i didn’t deserve to graduate magna cum laude.my family is financially supportive when i need them but not much else. my mom just tells me to take my meds (i do), or she offers me her meds. i told my sister earlier this year that i was feeling suicidal and she basically said, “between you and my cheating husband i’m going to go insane!”my own husband is patient but not very supportive. i’ve been on the couch since monday and he has been operating as normal, working, going into the office, never stopping to ask how i am. i know he wants me to return to “normal”. i worry he’ll give up on me.i interviewed for another job last week and this week. it was an adoption counselor position, something i’ve always dreamt of. i did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup. i didn’t get the job. while still working, i found a therapist- in hopes of getting the support i needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself. i made the mistake of telling her that i smoke weed sometimes. she then began questioning my work and my physical health. she also felt my main goal should be to get off meds (40 mg prozac), as i was somehow “putting my health at risk”. needless to say, i plummeting deeper into depression.i spoke to my pcp and he prescribed me an antipsychotic. after two days, i was so sick i had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again. when i asked to try something different, he told me “pills aren’t going to make you happy.”i guess i feel hopeless and alone. i have two little boys who are 3 and 6. my oldest son has severe special needs. i am able to take care of them, but i cannot get off the couch to do anything else. my body hurts, i can’t eat anything. my husband and kids went to breakfast and i stayed home to watch tv in my pajamas.i feel a bit like i’m already dead, and that nobody cares enough about me to try and help me.
depressed but in 2 0 1 8
spent new year's alone. here's to another shit year. 
people wonder why depressed or suicidal people don’t get help
when i was four years old, my family was going to leave our country to live in the united states. they abandoned everything so my brother and i could live a good life. how am i supposed to tell the people to gave up everything, worked every single day, learned an entire language through just talking to others, and moved away from their loved ones for me to have a good life, that i don’t even want my life anymore? how am i supposed to tell them i don’t want to live the life they wanted for me anymore? how am i supposed to tell them that? it would break their heart. it would break everyone’s heart. i can’t do that to them.
today my depression won, i dropped out of college
my depression won today, i couldn’t keep going as i was. i thought i could handle it, i really did. i was excited to study my major, but i couldn’t handle it. i started missing classes, forgetting to take proper care of myself. my room became a mess, and so did my grades.my parents are coming down tomorrow to pack my things up and bring me home, they’re going to get me the help i need, going to keep me under their supervision. i feel guilty as hell for wasting so much money and time for college when i knew i could never handle it with the way things are. my heart feels like it’s in my throat, my head feels like it’s stuffed with cotton. i’m going to have to quit my job and find a new one once i get home. at least i’ll try to find something to keep me sociable and busy during the day. 
anyone else's depression hit the hardest at night?
maybe it's just me, but i feel like the silence of every night is a reminder of how alone i feel. 
if someones willing to read this, itd make my night.
coming from an already broken heart:okay, so. yesterday was prom. i care about the girl i went with so much and were kind of talking too. she knows i deal with anxiety depression insomnia and some other shit. anyway. everyone got up at prom and started dancing. this freaked me the fuck out dor whatever reason. i really really felt like i was going to break down so i went outside and walked around. turns out i didnt have the willpower to go back inside with everyone dancing and shit. i was out there for 3 hours by myself, and the occasional teacher coming out to check on me which made me feel even worse. eventually i went back in just because i felt so fucking bad for not dancing with her and i just hung out with her on the dance floor. eventually prom ended, she was happy , and i wasnt. we went to afterprom and were sitting down together on a bench. i end up getting so tired im literally falling asleep. she reaches over and puts her arm around my waist and kissed by head and like rubbed me in an affectionate way. i looked at her and i hugged her so hard because thats literally one of the nicest things anyone has ever done me and one of the happiest moments of my life. prom is over now and i havent heard from her since and its making me super sad, and i know i only have 2 more months with her bc of college... i really dont know why this makes me so upset but it seriously doesedit: holy fuck this blew up. for anyone asking, i did text her yesterday. she didnt open my text and still hasnt this morning. kind of confused.update: she is super busy and i will hear back from her tonight.
depression is like being in an abusive relationship with your own brain.

if you get a pm from someone claiming that religion with cure your depression, please click report and then ignore it!
it appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to save them after they've posted here.  unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send pms, but if you click report it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take supportive conversations to pm right away.  the only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are: * they know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community. * they have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.if you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  we all get more out of it that way.  **edit:**  the above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  we completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  in those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.  don't forget that if you need help and don't feel safe posting, you're always welcome to message the moderators. 
regular check-in, and some info about high-risk posts.
welcome to the (ir)regular check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. if you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the role model rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.we try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. the community rules can be found in the sidebar. if you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us. if you have concerns or questions about the community policies, this is a good place to raise those as well. ****this time i want to share some points about helping ops who may be at risk for suicide.  * although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/suicidewatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of you should post there, not here message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  however, the information in [the sw sidebar](/r/suicidewatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  we link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  * almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the us. imagine the how it would feel for a us redditor to be told just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere meaning everywhere in the european union. there's a global directory in the /r/suicidewatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  * remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  the situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  * if you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking report.  the linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's dna, so clicking report on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  * keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  a strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. that's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1evwgu369jw) is always linked from our sidebar. 
today i realized i'm a panda.
proof:* the majority of food i eat daily is greens (mostly just spinach and kale)* i have low-no sex drive (due to antidepressants)* i sit/lay around most of the day* people care more about me staying alive than i do i honestly don't know if this funny, sad, or somewhere in between.
i feel like i'm becoming dumber everyday.
i literally cannot focus on anything. i can't pay attention in class. i can't study. i can't read a book. i can't even pay attention to video games. i can't watch a 10 min youtube video. i'm constantly zoning out. i'm just mindlessly going through life without really enjoying anything.edit : thanks for all your replies. i didn't know so many of you were feeling the same way as me. glad to know i'm not alone. gives me a bit of hope.
i hope this puts a smile on your face, reddit.

i believe this little comic i found sums it all up...

my mother died unexpectedly about 3 hours ago. the pain is paralyzing.
i was at my friends bday party at a bar when my father called me and told me that my mother laid to down to take a nap but never woke up. he was in bad shape when i got there so i decided to spend the night. i’m laying here hoping it’s just a nightmare but it’s really happening. she was my best friend and i don’t know how i’m going to go on.
anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances?
a lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. i really don't have any. i'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things i'd change but on the whole it's good).i just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. i've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. i run distance every single day and eat well.not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper. 
can you be suicidal but be scared to die?
i think about dying a lot. i think about the affect it would have and what would happen to the very few people who care about me. sometimes i wish everything would stop and i could just be gone. but i’m terrified of death, i think it’s my anxiety taking over. i feel like i can’t even be suicidal correctly, which i guess isn’t a bad thing but it makes everything worse in my fucked up head making me feel like more of a failure.
it’s 5am i have not slept and i am spiraling
edit: *obligatory “wow this blew up* i found this subreddit in early hours of the morning, very anxious and upset about life in general. i don’t even know if i’m using it right haha. but i wanna say thank you to everyone who has sent kind words or even just a “damn me too” because it really helps knowing i’m not alone in my feelings.i am currently seeing a therapist. he is great i’ve been going to him for a while, but unfortunately it’s a little hard for me to see him because he’s at my university’s counseling center and he’s pretty much always booked.i so appreciate the advice on the student disabilities and medical leave. it’s definitely something i’m going to look into, and it wasn’t anything i was aware of until now, so thank you for mentioning it!someone suggested i wasn’t going to class just because. i feel like for clarification’s sake i should mention the reason i haven’t been is because i got very sick (i know these absences are excused) and that on top of getting used to new depression meds made it difficult. i live about 20 minutes away from campus, so it’s not like i can just run out of my dorm into my class haha.i don’t know really know where else to go or how to format this so i guess i’ll just bullet point why my life is extra shitty right now:• college is kicking my ass right now. i haven’t been to class in like 3 weeks 1) what’s the point in going anymore i am so far behind by now and 2) i don’t even want to be in college right now and it’s taken me a year and a half to really realize i only went because i felt pressured to by peers and family. i want to drop out so badly, because i know i’m just not in the headspace to do it right now, but my family expects a lot out of me because i was “smart” in high school and i don’t want them all to hate me and also i will lose a pretty big scholarship if i quit going and shakdnhdiebd (not to mention no one else my age is having any problems with this, just me which makes me feel 50x worse about the whole thing. like i have friends taking 18 hours this semester and i’m so behind and i’m only doing 13 haha what a loser amrite)• i found out last week that i’m losing my job. i work retail and yeah i could find another job easy, but i was planning on being there for at least my undergrad and for some reason the store i work at being shut down threw a huge fucking wrench in my life plan. not to mention it’s almost holiday season, i don’t want to be the newbie at a new job when it’s already gonna be hectic and i love the place i work at right now and i’m just sad in general it’s gonna be gone• i started taking antidepressants about a month ago and sometimes i feel fine but mostly i’m just exhausted and can’t wake up until the late hours of the afternoon, which really doesn’t help my whole not going to class thingi’m just so stressed and have a constant headache i go to see my therapist later today which is good i guess but i just needed to put this out there to kind of clear my headif anyone read this then thank you, i’ll take it as a sign of validation hahaha
who else desperately craves stable employment but has crushing anxiety and absolutely no idea what they want to pursue?
i have had this realization lately and it is very crap :(
i desperately want someone to reach out to me, but when they do, i fucking hate it.
anybody else do this? if so, why? and what the fuck?you find yourself leading a life of self-imposed isolation, full of all kinds of self-hate, wishing desperately for some kind of validation, help, or support of some kind, wishing your friends (or really anyone) would actually reach out and give a shit......and then when someone does, and offers help or support of any kind, you get extremely uncomfortable with the human contact, and all the emotional aspects that come with it, to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you, “mattering,” or, “being worth something,” and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone, thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do? seriously, what the fuck? i’ve noticed this pattern in myself and i can’t understand why. it feels like a combination of not deserving it and flat-out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that. it just freaks me out and makes me want to push away even harder, which logically i know makes it worse, but i can’t seem to break the cycle.anybody else ever felt or dealt with something like this? because i’m at a loss here.
sleep isn't just sleep anymore, it's an escape.

when developing a crush on someone, does anyone else get depressed as fuck?
everytime i see a human being that makes my heart stop i get really sad because i've convinced myself that i will never, never be able to have someone like that...if anyone at all.
every notification i get on my phone is just false hope that someone actually cares about me.

am i the only one that doesnt go to sleep because they dont want to get up the next day?
this has been going on for about a year, i just don't see the point in going to sleep if i'm waking to another shitty day.
anyone else functionally depressed?
you can still go to work/school, spend time with friends and family, and act like a totally normal person but feel completely dead inside. i'm in school and i make decent grades. my friends go to karaoke bars regularly to hang out and drink. it feels so weird singing emotionally charged songs while feeling absolutely nothing. feels like living a lie.
being depressed is like being in a hurry to get nowhere

the saying it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem kinda loses its meaning after 15 years of having the problem.

i’m only 19 but i can’t shake this feeling that my life is over.
i feel like i wasted my youth. i get so nostalgic for high school and being that young again even though it was one of the roughest periods of my life. i just have this existential dread hanging over me. like what’s left after this? i wasted what’s supposed to be some of the best years of your life and now i’m old and my future will be working 9-5 and paying bills while living paycheck to paycheck trying to survive. i don’t know how anyone is truly happy in life.edit: thank you guys so much for all the responses. i’ve read each one and they seriously made my day so much better. i’m going to visit my college’s counseling service and attempt to make sense of my brain.
does anyone else feel like there's a voice inside your head, like an inner demon, telling you how much you suck and keeping you down all the time?
it's like, this inner demon wants to push me into his abyss and i'm holding with all the strenght i have but it's been hard to hold on for much longer. i hate this demon.
i often think depression is just realizing how the world really works.

does anyone else welcome the idea of an accidental death?
i've recently come to terms with my depression. ive contemplated suicide, but i don't think i will ever do it. but every day, when i'm driving to school, i have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me. i think that's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die. i think it would be better for my family. the memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved. i would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues. they would just say it was an unfortunate accident. does anyone else think like this?
i can’t stand it anymore. i’m committing suicide. this is my story. being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.
why does this happen to me.honest to god i hate my life so much. i’m a 16 year boy.i try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. so much has happen to me in the last year. my parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, i don’t if i should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. i never though much of it. but once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. when i came of age i found out the truth. i revealed it to. my parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. just because they wanted to save face. but what has happened happened . i escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). i escaped and entered foster care when i was 13/14 .i’m in my last year in high school. i have my gcse and i can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. i travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however i take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. so that meant i had 8 hours to sleep or study.so i barely get any chance to revise. especially since i know i’m smart (i got straight 7s ‘a’ in my mocks before this unfolded). so it’s so frustrating since i didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now i’m struggling to stay in my high sets. then there’s my social life. as i said it’s hard to do anything since i live far my original town (around an hour away). side track- i used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which i was proud off. but that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. i gained weight and now i’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). and one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. she had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). she was also a social worker. however i forgot to mention. it was this women, this women who i confided in. someone i though was my hope. she was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when i turn 18. she betrayed me and made it seems as though i fabricated this lie so i could move out. she promised me to wait till i turned 18 so i had a choice in my life. but nope she couldn’t wait. first of all. i wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. they both told my aunty. but to save face. they threatened the other two. because they’re still 11. they’re more likely to listen. i didn’t. therefore the reason i was tortured. i hate her with all my life. my only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) in addition to my social life. as i mention i was bullied my whole childhood. i was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. mentally or physically. and because i wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. i was still naive then. he betrayed me twice in high school. i ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time i trusted him and he betrayed me. a few weeks after that i met a new person who was a really good friend. that was when his cousin wasn’t around. his cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still i didn’t even say it, i proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all i did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. that infuriated me since i knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. i didn’t end my friendship with this person, but i did drift off from him. i then met a person who was a genuine nice person. we had a good couple of months. but his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone i would trust. i also met another genuine person. he was a new kid. and he is now my best friend, i think. it was weird because i never expected it to happen since he was popular i was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. but i always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. but i do know he cares for me as a friend. but a lot of the time i think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. in fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. the thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what i mean). it honestly is so fucked up me. i only have. what like a month to my gcse and all i. am is depressed, down, i have never once been happy this year. actually that was a life. the only thing that makes me happy is anime. i’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. this was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so i went upstairs to watch movies until i stumbled onto anime. the only good thing i can think of is that in 2 mo the i turn 16 which means i’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. i’ll be in a new town (in a new school( i’ll be in college) and i’ll be able to start a fresh start. but still looking how my life is. it feels like i’m meant to have a hard life. it doesn’t help that i’m an atheist because that means i’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. i’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, i’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). it’s so fucking frustrating. honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. i’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that i’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. all i want now is to become rich and take over the world. without any selfish desires, i just want to truly make this world better. because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. i’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.edit: half a year later into now january 2020(in my first year of college). my life has gone worse. i’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. and no one understands me. they have bad view of me. and when i try to explain. they place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. especially when i have facts. my social life hasn’t changed. my genuine friend with strict parents. guess what happened. you would have never would’ve guessedhe spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. i’ve gained weight. i’m back to my weight before my weight loss. i’m now again 85kg. i didn’t get into the course i wanted in college becuz i was a grade behind. the works easy, but i can’t seems to concentrate. i zone out when the teacher scolds. even though i really do want to listen. i do want to try. i’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.i’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. i’m lost. i’m hopeless. i’ve got no one for me. i’m no one number one. i’m alone. i got literally nothing  to lose. and no one benefits from me being alive. it i’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. i have bad luck. there’s no desputing that. it is what it is. i’m committing the act on my birthday which is in june.. to a certain extent. this is kinda funny. who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but i was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone i meet would suffer like this. the good guy gets nothing. wow even i cringed when i said that. whatever happens in june happens. if i do commit. i’d at least want someone to know my story. and if they meet someone like me. please i beg with all my life, help him. the one thing i wish i had. was someone who understood. someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  someone who would’ve been my hero. thank you for reading. this is ku/kw(before i changed my name and after initials) 14/6/2020✌️sorry i should’ve mentioned it. i’m in my second half on year 13. college.  i failed my gcse. i didn’t get enough sleep. i ran away during one exam and all the others i couldn’t concentrate. i kept zoning out. i didn’t get into my a level classes. i haven’t made any new friends. my anxiety hasn’t lessened.in fact my social life has gone far worse.im finding it hard to keep up with all things pain i feel mentally.
do you ever feel like you're just not cut out for this world?
inb4 comments like you're just acting helpless or what makes you different from everyone else? i'm not trying to act helpless or like i'm different. i just feel like i'm too weak. there a lot of things that upset me that... shouldn't. like i'm terrified of confrontation, to the point where i start shaking. and i can't have arguments. everything makes me exhausted, after 10 minutes of badminton i couldn't breathe, even getting excited or nervous gives me a headache. it's like i have no energy, i get so tired when doing schoolwork. and i'm very sensitive to what kind of advice i get, stuff like tough love gets me close to hyperventilating and i'll be upset for the rest of the day. i just don't know what to do, and i admit it, sometimes i just want to quit. i guess i just have to try harder, but often i feel like i'm too weak and sensitive and i won't make it in the world, and that things would be better if i stopped existing. 
my mother died today
i hope that i see you again one day.
i'm not suicidal, but i genuinely just have no interest in anything, including being alive.
i'm an atheist and i just don't think there's any reason to have to go through such a waste of time, breathing on this planet for another 50-60 more years, if it just means i'll end up in the same place regardless of if i did something with myself or not.i'm currently not studying, and i'm looking for a job. i went to a job/recruitment agency this morning, and they asked me a bunch of stuff that i was unable to give a proper answer to.---> so what's your dream job? :)\*shrug\* er... i don't have one.> well, if you had to pick a job what would it be?i really don't know... i guess one where i don't have to talk to people.> it says here you were recently studying. can i ask what exactly you studied?i just graduated in social sciences.> oh, that's great! we can help you get a job related to that. :)er... i don't really have any interest in the field.> then if i may ask... why did you study social sciences?\*shrug\* old-fashioned parents expected me to go to university after school.> okay, moving on... what are your long-term or short-term goals?er... i don't have any...---i just started tearing up half-way into answering the questions, thinking something's seriously wrong with me that i don't have any goals or dreams. i've never been ambitious my whole life. even as a kid, when you're supposedly full of wonder and imagination, i never really had a i wanna be a rockstar/princess/astronaut! moment.it was always just i have to go to school cos i have to, i have to study hard cos i have to, i have to get good grades cos i have to. and now that i'm out in the world, i still haven't figured out what the fuck's the point of anything.
does anybody else's mind immediately go to death as a solution?
every time a new problem comes up, no matter how big or small, i sometimes can't help but think, this is such a pain. i'd rather be dead.for example, here recently i caused a minor car accident, and afterwards all i could think was 'how can i kill myself?' because of the guilt and all my other faults. it almost scared me at how viable it seems as a solution. no more suffering, no more being useless, no more stupid mistakes...
could we get a hands up of those who do absolutely *nothing* all day every day?
those with no school or work. if you browse reddit 10 hours a day basically.
people are too practical when it comes to depression
so many people don't understand that sometimes, someone just wants them to understand what they're going through. to be comforted emotionally instead of given practical advice. in moments of desperation i used to say stuff like: i'm a piece of shit,i deserve to die. i don't need someone telling me i'm wrong, or what next steps i should take to feel better like exercise or eat healthy. i need someone to just say: i'm sorry you feel that way, that sucks. that's all i need. someone to acknowledge my feelings. trying to fix an emotional problem practically is like someone trying to fix a broken leg by talking.
i get a horrible comedown after fun days of socializing. after good times with friends, i get home and feel exceptionally lonely and empty.
maybe being an introvert it is just a draining affect? i dunno. it stinks when depression smacks you in the face after a while of feeling ok or even good.
i feel i am at the middle point where i don't 'deserve' being labeled depressed and i am not happy enough to be labeled healthy
don't misunderstand this title, please. i am by no means saying depression is any kind of privilege - suggesting you can use 'the depression card' or whatnot. my point is that i feel my problems are irrelevant because i know there are a lot of people out there who suffer worse than me. i feel i am not in a position to complain. yet, i don't feel content. i feel more apathy than much else and i don't know if that is depression and i am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis. some part of me believes i can solve this on my own, but another part asks, and how long will that take, considering your less than stellar situation, will and mindset?oh, and then there's the part which definitely thinks i shouldn't waste my time writing this, which in turn may waste your time by reading this. i am just confused and a little tired. i seek no sympathy from you guys, but maybe someone can relate. i wish you all a good day.
i hate the depression cycle
you know, the one where you hit “rock bottom” and you have a mental breakdown, talk to someone, and then suddenly feel motivated to do something about your shit self.. until you eventually feel awful again. rinse repeat. it’s very tiring. 
if we treated all illnesses the way we treat mental illness.

i feel the need to constantly distract myself with reddit, netflix, tv, etc because anything is better than being alone with my thoughts for more than a second

walking home after a bad week, saw this on an overpass i used to regularly contemplate jumping over [x-posted to montreal]

does anyone have literally 0 friends or people to talk to?
yes, literally 0. i kno we like to say we are lonely here, but actually most people here actually have someone to talk to, even if it's online. that being said i just havr to say that i am trying to deal with it and as embarrassing as it may sound i often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak (even if i hate my voice and i find it grating). i am mostly okay with it...i think. sometimes it gets really bad, but i try to occupy my mind with video games anf music so i don't think about killing myself.edit: i want to thank everyone for replying to this, i had no idea it would blow up so much. i was very in my feelings when i made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself. i went to sleep and now i am feeling a little better. i promise i will take time to read all the replies and respond to everyone. i also want to thank everyone who sent me a private message, i will reply to those too, but at the moment i am just feeling overwhelmed cause i didint expect people to actually relate to this or reply. i know it sounds cheesy, but i just wish i could hug all of you.
i fucking hate when that wtf am i doing with my life wave hits, and hopelessness that follows
sometimes it hits me at 2:49 in the morning when i catch myself in the mirror on the way from kitchen to my room, sometimes in 4pm when i realize how fucking alone i am and wasting the summer doing nothingi hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was not needed anymore, no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badlywhere i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have nonefor the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimesi can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to homei had a decent life back in high school, it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral, i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard
i think one of my main fears is that i'm not depressed...just lazy

does anyone else's body go into sleep mode when you're really depressed?
i've noticed the last few weeks, i've been sleeping a lot more during the day than i ever have, especially after interacting with my dad. it's not even something i can control, my body just shuts down for a few hours. the most infuriating part of it is that it screws up my sleep schedule, so i'll struggle more than usual to sleep.
someone told me i look like i'm on power saving mode.
and that's exactly how i feel.
ever get so depressed that you stop wanting to get better?
i'm at the point where i don't really want anything in life, even happiness. i know logically i could probably get better if i put my mind to it, but that thought just doesn't appeal to me anymore. it sounds weird putting it out in writing, but i was wondering if anyone else can relate to this. thanks for reading, i hope you have a nice day.
i was depressed as a teenager, worked hard and got my own place and all the things i thought would make me feel better, and now i'm more depressed than ever in my mid 20s.
i can't maintain friendships. i can't connect with people. i push people away when i need them the most.it is so hard to describe the feeling and experience. i look forward to my free time, i plan and structure my life so i have it. but when i reach that point it is like i've gotten dumped off, with a clear schedule and the world at my fingertips.i should be enjoying life more than ever, but i don't have a social structure to lean on. i've grown apart from my friends and family. i make plans for my days off with people, but when they come i cancel them.i just lay in bed and stare at the sky through the windows. the only thing that gets me up is caffeine headaches. i probably spent a whole hour today smacking the pull string on the ceiling fan in my bedroom and watched it for 5 minutes until it would stop moving completely and then i would smack it again. it was a boring, tortuous, and arduous experience but i wouldn't stop.
one of the cruelest things about depression: when even your friends' accomplishments and happiness start bringing your mood down.

do you ever feel that trying to talk about your feelings is totally pointless?
lately it feels like everyone wants me to be ok for their sake. i'm sure they want what's best for me but they feel more inclined to not worry themselves and convincing me and them that i'm fine and that i will be fine. my therapist and my psychiatrist don't seem to listen to me when i tell them i feel the same or even worse. i don't know, i try to talk to my friends, my girlfriend, that love me and want the best for me but every time i trey to open up it feels pointless and leaves me feeling stupid for even trying
i had more motivation as a sperm
i won a big marathon against billions lol.
do you guys ever think was i ever really happy?
looking back on my life everything always seems so grey and dull.
anybody else stays up late on sunday because they're afraid of the week?

do you ever cope by imagining a person/world that makes you feel safe?
i think we might become stronger if we can imagine things are perfect when reality is falling apart. it doesn't always work but you can always try
do you guys daydream your life away?
i waste so much time listening to music and pacing. i imagine this fantastic new life i have and i am wasting so much time with family and friends and on my life. my life is passing away and i realize i will never amount to what i daydream and it made my depression go to a dangerous state. do you guys do this too?edit: wow guys thanks for all the comments and upvotes it’s so incredibly reassuring that i’m not the only one with this. thanks for all the support and advice i really take it to heart. i still haven’t really solved this problem but knowing i’m not the only one really helps thanks everyone i truly wish you all the best thank you
i did it
after a month of udder crippling depression, not only did i wake up and get out of bed i got dressed in a nice outfit and put some make up on... i think things are getting better. 
just became a father, and death sounds better every day.
---update---i just made an appointment to discuss therapy and/or medication changes. i've been on this road before (pre-baby depression) with a lack of results, but for the sake of my wife and child, i'm willing to try again. wish me luck everybody.---end update---alright, parents and child-lovers everywhere - get ready to hate me. i don't blame you, and really i don't care. i can't be unapologetically honest with anyone i know personally, so you strangers on the internet are the only outlet i can use.i have dealt with depression since middle school, so this bullshit isn't new to me. about 2 months ago, i and my wife had our first baby, and those two months have been the worst time of my life. i have been in dark places before, but becoming a dad has taken me to hellacious places in my mind that i never knew existed within me. for starters, i feel no love or connection to my baby at all. all i see is an obnoxious living ball of needs. i never wanted kids growing up, in fact, i have always hated babies and children under 13-15 years old. i only agreed with my wife to try for a baby because 1) my wife wanted a baby for most of her life, and i wanted to make her happy. 2) i thought the parental instinct and unconditional love would come naturally when she was born and i started interacting with her.you always hear parents say that they love their kids more than anything, and they are worth all of the trouble they cause, but i strongly disagree. i want our baby out of my life until they are at least a teenager, maybe even forever.i am a very analytical person, and i have gone over all of the feasible options available to me, and they are all so fucking horrible to me that i honestly prefer suicide over facing the rest of my choices and their consequences.i love my wife with all of my heart, so the idea of divorce tears me apart even if it would let me be rid of our baby. i know what kind of life the two of them would live if we did divorce, and there is no way i could be that cruel. so i am essentially stuck staying in my marriage and keeping the baby, and i just have to suck it up and live with the worst fucking mistake i ever made. the idea of raising a baby, toddler, child, teen, etc is literally hell for me and experiencing it is proving to be worse than the idea alone. hence why suicide has started sounding so good.my depression has always seemed to revolve around the notion that life takes too much effort/work, which really fucking sucks since a baby is nothing but goddamn effort/work. i am literally forced to care for and sustain the worst trigger i have ever encountered for my depression. the more i interact with my baby, the worse my mental health gets. the less i interact with my baby, the shittier i feel about what kind of father i'm being, which also leads to a decline in my mental health. no matter what i do, i am in a perpetual downward spiral.i don't want to hurt our baby, but i can't deny that the temptation arises when it won't stop crying. i find myself visualizing terrible things when i am desperately hoping it will shut the hell up.i can't even put all of the words down for some of my feelings lately. i feel so horrible about the way i see my own child and even worse about the fact i can't do anything to make it better.and before anyone asks, yes i have talked to my wife about this and to make a long story short, it didn't really help my mental dilemma. nothing got worse by talking about it (besides learning she hopes to have a 2nd kid one day (hell no)), but she did not have any input that i had not already thought of myself.
i decided to open up to my mother about my anxiety problems
she understood and we'll make an appointment with the doctor. hopefully i'm on the right path to healing. :)&#x200b;edit: i wanna thank each and every one of you for the supportive and very kind comments. i love you all and i wish the best to all of you! we're all strong fighters here! stay safe :)
does anybody here feel like they daydream all the time instead of living their life?
like i said. daydreaming about the things i'd want to happen; about the things i can do, but won't, because of my social anxiety, which lead to my depression. daydreaming about having conversations with people i know that probably won't happen. daydreaming about not being lonely...it's fucking exhausting, knowing that i can't make any of those dreams come true even though there's literally nothing holding me back, except myself.
does anybody feel like they were born too weak and sensitive for this world?
this world favors strong character: confidence, self-respect, charisma, determination, fearlessness etc etc. obviously i don't add up to any of those. in fact i'm downright opposite. my life so far has been a history of failures and regrets. i'm so sensitive it's honestly embarassing. at this point anything is enough to send me into an episode. i'm too fucking useless and repulsive to succeed anywhere in life. i find myself constantly daydreaming about an imaginary world, where i actually have friends, where i don't loathe myself so much, where life doesn't seem pointless and i have a purpose
when i see posts with 600 upvotes i can only imagine 600 people reading my posts and saying: lol, who the f*ck cares...

just saying “i have depression” feels like i’m minimizing what i’m actually experiencing
i really hate it when i try to explain to people what’s wrong and i don’t want to go into the nitty gritty due to a whole slew of reasons but saying “sorry, it’s my depression” just doesn’t seem to convey the weight and magnitude this illness has. i need a new name or word for it. 
send me a message if you ever need to talk is one of the biggest lies ever.

who has peak days where they formulate new exciting plans for the week, only to end up in a cold dark lonely hopeless confused state of mind a day later? i've noticed that's pretty much my life.

my wife committed suicide yesterday
my wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. she attempted overdosing in december, but i found out and called an ambulance. yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while i was out. i don't know why i'm writing this. it might be to prevent others from doing this, but i think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  i found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. i don't mean to diminish this, but i believe it was mostly in her head. she operated normally as far as i could tell, but was fixated on this idea. i noticed she got worse recently but i believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. i guess i was wrong.  she thought i would be better off without her. that the pain i was going through watching her was too much for me. i truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. i wish i could tell her how wrong she was. now i feel trapped. i don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but i also don't see suicide as an option. how can i put my loved ones through what i'm now going through? i can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct. edit: thank you all for your support. i promise that, despite the timing of this, it is not an april's fool joke. i really wish it was. edit 2: thank you again for all the support. i'm going to see someone today and friday. the funeral is tomorrow. it's going to be a rough few days. 
i think so too.

i miss so very many people...

i don’t want to have kids because i don’t want them to experience depression
i’m only 16, but i’ve already made up my mind: i’m never going to have kids. i can’t stomach the thought of passing my depression down to them, or them having to grow up with a parent struggling with depression. it just wouldn’t be fair to them.
anyone else's 'okay' days still pretty fucking awful?
my okay days used to be decent, i wasn't particularly motivated or anything but i didn't feel like shit. now my okay days are just days where i don't actively want to die but i still have suicidal thoughts and can't stop thinking about depressing shit unless i'm fully distracted which is really hard to achieve.edit: thanks for all the words of support, it's really helped and i feel much better now i know it's not just me feeling this way, really appreciate it guys.
i think i've been depressed for so long that.....
.... that it's a part of my personality now. the helplessness and pessimism is such an integral part of my life that i now feel like i have to cling to it; to let go of it would be akin to forming a completely new personality. does that make sense?
i’m so uncomfortable when people ask “what have you been up to” every time i see them.
it’s hard fumbling about trying to think of something interesting when all i do is go on youtube, play video games and go to class. usually, i just go “not much how about you”. it’s embarrassing and sad, but it’s not like i’m passionate about anything else. i wish i was.edit: thank you for the gold, stranger! 
anyone else fantasize about leaving everything, running away, and starting over somewhere?
this has been a recurring fantasy of mine for years. i'm thinking, well, things can't get much worse, so instead of killing myself how about just leaving everything. maybe go to a different country and starting over. i've been binge watching disappeared a lot and can really relate to many of the people who vanished all of a sudden.
you know you've fallen deep, when the thing you wan't the most is a normal conversation or a hug.
i don't know anybody with whom i could have a normal conversation and i definitely don't know anybody, that would hug me. 
anyone feel like you’ve gotten so good at hiding how depressed you feel that you start to believe you’re happy but then once you’re all alone it all comes back?
this is daily. none of my friends suspect anything at all because i’m the “happy strong” one of the group. but as soon as we all go home, i can’t help but feel like i’m worthless and everyone would be better off without me. 
i relapsed
i made an oath to myself to never stoop so low and to cut myself again. i made it to two months without doing it until today. i had so many emotions going through my body and i didn’t know what to do with it and so i just took it out on myself. i kept on going and going until i realize i had to stop because i almost covered my whole thigh. i’m sorry for triggering or being to graphic to anyone. i’m having a really hard time right now.
anyone else have a terrible fucking month
worst of the year. self destructed.
i miss myself.
i miss you so much. how did i get here? i look at old photos and i see a happy girl with insecurities, yes, but someone who was comfortable with who they were.so how did i get here? i feel so alone. who can i come home to if i can't come home to myself.
wife cheated on me, is threatening me, i feel lost.
i caught my wife lying about being somewhere when she was actually at a hotel. she’s threatening me with divorce if we don’t open our relationship. we have a two year old daughter. i just graduated college and all of my plans for graduation have fallen apart, i’ve been rejected from every fellowship i’ve applied to and interviewed for. i had a surgery two years ago that still is bothering me with complications. i can’t tell my wife, the only person i used to talk to about my depression or if i’m feeling suicidal.i’m so tired of feeling this way. i’m in so much pain all of the time. i feel completely and utterly humiliated. i just want the pain to stop. please help me. i can’t take this anymore. please. i don’t know what to do. fuck.i don’t want to lose my daughter. i love her so much. i’m just so lonely, scared, and hurt. i just want the pain to stop. i don’t want to deal with this pain anymore. is there a point when it’s okay to stop? i loved my wife so much, she was everything to me. i feel so broken.edit: i have read every single comment on my post, and deeply appreciate all of your support. you’re all channeling the anger i’ve been suppressing for a few weeks now. my family is really well connected in the legal community, i’m just hesitant to pull the trigger and start asking for contacts. word spreads pretty quick and i’m not sure i’m ready for everyone to know right now.im taking  all of your advice into consideration and am going to take some concrete steps towards strengthening my position against her threats.
girlfriend attempted suicide. i'm a wreck.
i posted this on /r/suicidewatch before i realized this sub existed.we have been dating for 7 months. i don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. we are great together. i can't imagine my life without her.we both struggle with depression. i was suicidal a few years back, so i can understand what she is going through. i have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; i convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. anyway....i had just arrived at work. only been there about 20 minutes, when i receive a phone call from her. we both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so i answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing i could understand was, i did it. i'm sorry.i bolted out of the office. she lives about 20 minutes away and by the time i got there she was in her bed laying there. i thought she was dead. i can't remember ever being that scared. i walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. she had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her klonopin.i was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. she's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. i'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time i'm not going to be there to save her.i understand that it has nothing to do with me. i understand depression. i've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. but, i can't help but beat myself up. i'm about as mushy and kind as they come. spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, i listen and hang on her ever word, basically i know i'm a good and loving boyfriend. she kept repeating, i don't know why you love me so much. i'm horrible. i tried to tell her that's not true.leaving her at the facility was so hard. she cried so much. she wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. it's been almost a week and i miss her so much. we are never apart.i know i'm doing everything i can. i just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. i went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so i don't have a ton of people to talk to.i'm depressed as fuck now. it's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. i'm not suicidal, but i sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. this is tough.*edit* *update*i saw her at visitation tonight and she was very upbeat. she is taking all therapy seriously and seemed to be genuinely happy for the first time. i feel a bit better about things. thanks to all of you for your support. *edit*she gets to come home this sunday. time to clean the fuck out of her house for her. =)
anyone ever been emotionally hurt so long that it physically hurts in your chest?
i have alot going on in my mind, that it just starts to hurt alot in my chest. but i've got no one to talk to and no one's willing to listen..
one of the worst parts of depression is when people get tired of supporting you.
i was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, my family was very supportive at the start, i had a girlfriend who loved me and i wanted to make her my wife.but the years have passed and my condition has not improved, people just start to get tired and see you as emotionally draining. this caused my girlfriend to leave me, my parents to get emotionally distant from me and my friends to disappear.now i am alone, miserable and suicidal. i have no one to talk to about this. my job sucks, my life sucks, and i see no way out of the miserable pit i live in.depression not only makes you hate yourself, it makes everyone else hate you as well. 
does anyone else feel shame in their depression because having it seems cliché and overused these days?
i'm so tired of hearing everyone's depressed and other people have it much worse than you. like i'm completely aware my life should be great and now i just feel bad for complaining?? are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more? i understand i'm not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because i can't control my emotions but also give me a break.  *edit: aw, guys. this has really blown up in just over 24 hours. i'm so glad none of us are alone and it's truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view. i have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think i'm feeling. it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem, a chemical imbalance, rather than a bad few weeks. many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to. i kind of wrote this as a rant because i've been frustrated with my support system blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because i'm highly functioning. i go to work, i run errands, i see friends, but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep. you just need to sleep more, or try to relax, or my personal favorite, have you tried meditating or yoga? ha. we've all been there. i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even think you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️
do you ever pass the time at weekends by just sitting alone imagining how your life could be, if things were different?
a life of happiness, friends, social life, money, a decent job.
does anyone feel like they are faking every single human interaction?
i'm a teacher and recently, have been told by management that i need to add more excitement to my classroom. because of this, i've been trying to play a more comedic role, telling jokes, and so on. today i realized that everyone i talk to... students, other teachers, or management, i wear this smiling face. nobody sees my true colors. at the end of most days, i'm left feeling exhausted. i don't know if i can teach anymore. when i get home i just shut down, curl up in a ball and feel finally like myself..the only person who knows a little about my depression is my girlfriend. she knows i have bad days but doesn't realize it goes deeper than that.i wonder if anyone can relate to this?
anyone else not exactly ‘suicidal’ just entirely okay with dying?
like you just don’t care whether or not you die, but you’re not exactly taking purposeful steps towards it just yet? hope this makes sense ^^”
tired of hearing it'll get better when it clealy isn't
toxic family, unfaithful friends. failed relationships and no hope for a girlfriend any time soon. my marks are getting worse. probably gonna lose my bursary. medication is more but the depression isn't less. am i cursed to feel like a outcast/weirdo/loser my whole life? everyone keeps telling me just to get back up when life knocks you down. but i'm tired of fighting a losing fight. i just want to sleep.
does anyone else's mind like to randomly tell you that you should die?
does anyone else have those thing where like you're totally okay, nothing is happening to trigger it at the moment, but then your brain is just like i want to die? its really friggin annoying because like i tried to reply to it no i don't but then it replies back yes i do and it just repeats until it drives me insane. it's bad enough when i actually have something going on, but to have it on my few good moments/days is really depressing because its like i'm never free from it. if you have this, what do you do to get it to shut up?additionally, whenever i do something stupid/embarrassing/not perfect, my first thought is always kill yourself even if it's just like i cut some onions not evenly or i dropped something. its really disturbing and i'm so tired of it. how do you get this to stop?
why do parents care more about school work than your mental state?
i’ve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return, i’ve been late on assignments. my parents know that i’ve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety lately and i’ve told them the reason why my assignments are overdue. it’s because i’m too mentally drained and unmotivated to do it. i️ can’t come up with anything to write because i’m too focused on how bad everything is. they never ask me how i’m doing, they ask me if i️ve gotten any homework done yet. and i️ just can’t take it anymore.edit: my parents do care about me, i️ know they do. they just don’t understand how serious its becoming. i know they’re trying to be supportive and understand what it is that i’m dealing with and why i️ haven’t been focusing or wanting to go to school but it’s hard to believe that sometimes when i️ just feel like they’re just trying to ignore everything that’s happening.
do you ever wish with all your heart that you never existed?
have you ever hated everything so bad that you just wanted to be nothing...like literally nothing, just blank.\- it's like the fear many people have of there being nothing but blank when they die, but for that nothingness to be your escape?
anyone else miss being a kid?
i miss playing pokémon on my gameboy, i miss drawing comic books with my friends, i miss being free of responsibility. i’m a 26 year old man now and i’ve failed to live up to my duties as a man. i miss the care free days of just being a kid. who else misses it?
i'm off my medication, haven't cut myself in 70 days and i've been going to school.
for a full fucking week. i haven't been an entire week in school since like a year back and it doesn't feel 100% awful. tho it's been a full week of only rehearsals, so no ordinary classes or schoolwork, i'm still failing all my courses but it doesn't matter because i've been going to school and been there for like 6 hours every day. and i'm not even on antidepressants anymore, i can wake up, i can get out of bed i've been doing great and i'm fucking proud. i'm putting my entire soul into the play we're rehearsing and i've been praised for my acting and it feels great. i hate socialising and small talk but i  l o v e  performing, i've been reminded that this is why i'm still alive and kicking. and it's gonna be fucking amazing.edit: thank you all so much for every single comment, i opened reddit and the replies came like a punch of validation <3 
do you guys feel like every little task is exhausting?
so, i’ve had major depressive disorder for over half of my life. do you guys ever feel as if every little task throughout the day is just exhausting, to the point where it feels like you need a break after accomplishing each one? for example, i know that i need to go grocery shopping, but even thinking about doing it is exhausting; so, i take a break after thinking about it. then, i make a shopping list, which is exhausting; so, i take a break after making the list. and now, i’m faced with actually going to the store, which brings about a million other little exhausting tasks! for example, driving there, getting a cart, walking around, finding items, walking around some more, trying to control intrusive thoughts, walking around some more, then paying, then taking the shit to my truck, then driving back, then taking the shit out of my truck and into my apartment! fuck! so many fucking things! i’m exhausted just thinking about it.update: dang, this post blew up! also, i did not end up going to the store, haha.
has anyone else been depressed since they were children?
i don't know if it's even possible for children to have depression-- everytime i've told a psych professional they've laughed at me. the thing is, though, i've literally always been depressed. like, i hear people talk about how times were easier when they were younger and how they could go back to that time of innocence and all, but i never had that. maybe, *maybe* in my first few years i was moderately happy, but from then on i've always been depressed. i just grew up too fast.does anyone else understand what i mean?
do you ever feel like nothing matters because you'll probably end up killing yourself anyway?
why even attempt to self improve? i'll probably fuck it up and make myself more miserable, and since i'm going to commit suicide anyway, there's no point in even trying. might as well continue down my self destructive path until i muster up the courage to end it all
dear mods: can you please do something about the influx of tough love zealots on this subreddit? it's a clear violation of the rules on the sidebar for anyone to advocate tough love bullshit. we need you to crack down on this. people are getting insulted, emotionally abused and put down daily.
the tough love ideologues are really getting out of control. i don't know where they are coming from. they are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense, and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement. many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone, and extremely judgmental, harsh and condescending in content. we really need the mods to crack down on this. i also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here. i understand that you say that on the sidebar. but i request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner. there are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance.i strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love.i think it's about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their dr phil reruns.
im so lonely, but i no longer have any energy to maintain a relationship.
im a burden, im toxic, i hate myself. loneliness began eating me whole when i realized no one is actually ever there for me. my friends has stopped trying to understand me.it just sucks bcs before i fully sunk into this hole, i was trying very hard to be cheerful. i always went out of my way to make others happy or to try at least understand them. i always, always sacrifice my time, and love--something i couldn't give myself i gave to others. but its so sad when i realized everyone was so much happier when i wasn't included.one time i just saw my friends having fun together and i stopped in my tracks to go to them. i stared from afar how joyous they were without my presence, therefore i maintained it that way. i kept avoiding them, i just didn't have anymore energy to hold a basic conversation. i cant even finish tasks anymore. im still friends, we still talk, but they know how i feel now ans they don't understand me. they thought i was just having mood swings. how i wish that was the case. cleaning the house takes me weeks to finish and i cant even do my homeworks anymore. im failing class and im failing life.tl;dr?it doesn't matter what i do or what i choose i'm what's wrong. there's nothing i can do about it. if i'm not hurting myself, i'm hurting everyone around me. there's nothing i can do about it. i'm... i'm broken. -- det. debra morganim sorry for wasting your time.
the shittiest feeling is looking back on your day, and knowing full well you could've done a lot, but you didn't.
i could've done so much today. i could've finished work i should've been done with days ago and studied. but instead i did absolutely nothing. there were a few times where i tried to start my work, but instead just heavily procrastinated and browsed reddit and youtube all day...and look where i am now. i wasted the whole damn day! i'm on the brink of crying.and you know those occasional days that feel longer than usual days, where an hour feels like two, maybe three hours? it was one of those days. and the feeling like i had more time than usual today makes this feel so much worse.
*check this box if you have been feeling hopeless everyday for 2 week.*
for fucks sake how about half our life like most of us 
the robin williams posts are triggering
*edit: my use of triggering in the title refers to how i felt reading articles and comments regarding robin williams on the night of, not the anger i felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*it angers me to see posts saying if only robin williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now. in my bouts with depression, i wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. i'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *they don't really care. they just don't want my death on their conscience.* i'd bet money robin williams was the same way. who could be more loved than a funny-man?when someone tells me [in the context of suicide] i'd be sad if you died, i think, *great, so i should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* i think, *how selfish.* how is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? it's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. they don't feel it. they don't see it. because if i show it, hey, perk up. be happy. turn that frown upside down. depression isn't an on/ off switch.and so i never want someone to do something they don't want to do. i can remember one time that all i wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but i couldn't bring myself to say that. i didn't want my friend to play just because i asked or out of some moral obligation. (and i know that if i did, at the end i'd hear do you feel better? as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me less sad.) instead i just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.the robin williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about caring. if i die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, keep putting one foot in front of the other. just let go of that bad stuff. obligatory edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger! it's my first!
anybody else feel especially terrible on their birthday?
it’s my birthday today, and i feel way worse than usual. am i alone in feeling this way?edit: wow this post blew up. can’t say i had the best birthday, but i very much appreciate all of the people who wished me to have a happy one, and it definitely made me feel better! common themes that were brought up was that to increase enjoyment of birthdays, it is important to monitor your expectations, put yourself out there and be vulnerable, and know that it is common to feel this way, so therefore just make it your own celebration however you want to. even if that means doing it alone and treating yourself. best wishes and thanks again for your support!
high-functioning depression is...
- keeping the appointment with the dentist, because tooth pain sucks, even though all you really want to do is stay in bed- scheduling an appointment for the root canal you need, even though the mere thought of the procedure has you quaking in your boots- paying the bill that's ten days late for no reason other than you couldn't bring yourself to task on the day it was due- taking the car to the shop because the check engine light has been on for weeks and the inspection is due at the end of the month- doing all of the above and still not feeling proud of yourself or accomplished because there are a hundred other small things you're avoiding or flat out ignoring just to keep from feeling like your life is spiraling down the drain. who the hell let me adult.
when i lie in bed, i look forward to living in the dream world inside of my head. there, i am the person i’ve always wanted to be. i’m loved, safe, and happy. but when morning comes and i wake up, reality sinks in like a brick. my youth is gone and i’m still a failure, and i wish i never woke up.
i have tried so hard through most of my life to feel accomplished, to live a life i can be proud of. to love and be loved. but every day is another act of failure and rejection. the days get heavier and heavier. i’ve run out of strength. i want to stay in my bed. i want to stay in my dream world. i really, really don’t want to wake up. 
does anyone get triggered by being yelled at?
all of my life, getting yelled at has absolutely been the trigger to bring me to such a low. it’s the feeling that i did wrong, and that i’m useless and a fuck up that slowly grows darkness over me. i am not diagnosed with depression but i have bad anxiety and i know that they can go hand in hand to completely screw your life over. often, my moods fluctuate. i can have very high highs, where everything is good and i’m feeling beyond great, then with a simple trigger i can sink into this deep sadness where i go numb and have no interest in doing anything. i’m supposed to get a haircut today but i can’t seem to get out of bed. this feeling is scary and i hope for the best for anyone who deals with this. you are all loved! “one day at a time”
rick and morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts i've ever seen on television
so episode 3 of the new season, at the end, rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)when i see a suicidal person on tv i feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. now this obviously does happen, but i don't think it's the majority of attempts. those might be more likely to be a cry for help scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. if you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, i feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. you just want it done. it reminded me of hunter s thompson's suicide. his adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.rick is also one of the only characters i can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. he comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. i'm angry all the fucking time. because i'm in pain and i want to die, and i've used up all the fucks i had to give just getting out of bed today. i have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. still, most people who know me have no idea how sick i am until i tell them.  rick and morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? except nobody drinks like that without a reason. healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out. rick sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it.
school.

i don’t want to kill myself but if i died right now, i wouldn’t mind.
i hate my life. i’m stuck home with my depressed parents who make me feel guilty if i try to have a social life as though i should be at home moping around with them instead. it’s gotten to a point i feel selfish for wanting to go out with friends and if i do, i’m miserable. but i love being around people. i love talking and doing things with others but i can’t anymore. i don’t have anyone. 
do you ever feel like you have everything that's needed to be happy yet you are miserable anyways?
i just wanna now if i'm not alone...edit 1: i really appreciate all your replies, i read them all and will keep reading.i can safely say feeling disconnected from everything is what makes us the most damage, despite having all of our basic needs satisfied. i guess we all have to learn how to survive with this instead of fighting it, and sharing our thoughts here helps with that a lot.regards to everyone and thanks again.
:-)
:-(it's easy to hide.
depression is when 'cheer up' is the most annoying thing to hear.
it sucks when people tell you to cheer up when you fucking can't.
does anyone else here feel like before depression and anxiety they had so much potential and we're meant to do something great
before all the pain, suffering and hell?did you guys have potential? what did you want to do 
i just wanted to let anyone who read my last post know that i've taken a shower two days in a row and actually went and got my hair done.
i know to most it seems so simple a thing to do, but there are periods of time where i couldn't muster the energy to shower regularly.  also i didn't comb my hair for weeks and months at a time.  they cut off all that tangled mess and dyed it darker.  i feel better now, hopefully i can stay on track.
i wanted to die, but then i got a job.
now i *really* want to die.
my dad spilled boiling hot tea all over my lap. serious second degree burns.
i love my dad but he gets super mad when i don’t do as he asks, i was drinking some green tea when i was arguing with him , he hit  the cup i was holding and suddenly the worse pain ever was all over my thighs and stomach. it’s been 3 days since then, the doctors said it’s really bad but might not scar. i’m in so much pain guys i honestly wish he just killed me that night instead. i had to clean my wounds and it was so horrifying seeing your own raw flesh it’s just not meant to be seen man. worse day of my life. i’m not able to move out of bed at all currently. i’m feeling like shit atm. i just want to say that i hope you guys are getting through life better than i am. i don’t know if i’ll ever feel safe in my own house ever again. i’ve had sleep paralysis every night since of the incident. look all i’m saying is i really hope you guys are having a better day than i am, please make sure your eating well and taking as much care of yourselves as you can!edit: okay so this got way more attention then i wanted, but thank you so much for everyone with their well wishes and support. i was overwhelmed when i woke up to this, i truly was, and i was scared in a way to address all of this. firstly, if you guys want to see my wounds as you guys don't seem to be believing me, i will post a picture of the bandages, or if you guys want to see my actual wounds, i am willing, as i am getting the bandages changed at the hospital today. this post, more than anything, has made me realize that this sub is sacred to people that are going through bad things. i would never post a fake story and take up anyone's time. i understand why you guys would be suspicious, and i am willing to do whatever to prove myself. the reason i posted this was because i felt like shit and alone, and i needed to justify the pain i was going through, so i wanted to kindly ask people to be grateful for what they have, as it can always be worse, myself in this very moment included. instead, almost a thousand people have heard me, and have supported me. funny thing is, i've actually missed some resits for uni because of this and i might have to retake a year, and this thread has made it feel much less worse.secondly, my father. hes a good man, but this is the last time, he has promised to me. i belive him. i think the world of my parents, but things won't ever be the same between us. this is the last time, i love him, but this is too much. thank you all for your support, it means everything to me.i honestly had no one at that moment, but i feel so loved, thank you all.
for me, depression isn’t overwhelming sadness; it painfully boring
apathy, lethargy, dysphoria, melancholy... they all just make life so dull. sometimes i think i experience it differently from a lot of people, but i also know it’s a fairly common feeling. i’m not really seeking advice, just venting and probably seeking some validation.edit: apparently i failed to spell check the title... i blame the apathy 
if depression were a smashed hand.

i'm lonely but i hate when people talk to me.
kill   me
anyone else here feel dazed, zombie-fied and emotionless?
i mean, i feel like some kind of zombie robot just going through the motions of life but never truly engaged in it.everything i do is just on auto-pilot and it seems like a huge effort just to do anything...like even feeding myself or making a simple cup of coffee.i just walk around half-dazed all day doing what little i can do with no real motivation or pleasure behind it. i just live in a fog. it's almost like my brain has stopped producing any of the chemicals associated with reward, pleasure, motivation, etc and i'm merely existing.
no one cares if you're sad
one of the things you learn with depressionyour life isn't a tragedy to friends and fam, it's a black comedy. you don't get love and support by publicly suffering all the time. only by being great and happy all the time and having a bad day that one time. then they care.i dunno im drunk, ignore me.
do you ever feel like your depression is becoming your whole personality?
i've been falling back into a bad depressive episode recently and i feel like it's becoming my whole thing. all my jokes are about my depression and just offing myself, it's gotten to a point where i struggle to come up with non depression based jokes and comments. i was wondering if anyone else feels like their only personality trait left is their depression or if it's only me.
suicide is selfish
no, fuck you. the thing that's selfish is that you expect people to stick around just to keep you happy. why do people have such a problem with suicide? if i wanna end it i'll end it. i want out of this cruel world.
does anyone feel like depression stops them from being the person they were born to be, but then feels guilt and anxiety about trying to become that person.
i swear depression is one paradox. you start on level one, depression goes to level two, you go to two and depression goes to three. in the meantime you tell your self a bunch of bullshit to act like depression isn't taking over and ruining your life but it is. no one understands how awful it is, depression is a life stealing shitshowthere is not rock bottom, it always gets worse. whenever you think your at the lowest, it goes lower. growing into or enjoying yourself is impossibledepression has made me a walking idiot your 2% of your former self it makes me want to cry ):
does anyone else feel like they can no longer feel their own emotions, but instead have just learned to mimic those of the people around them in order to seem normal?
i seriously do not remember the last time i felt an emotion that was my own, beyond the alternating crushing ennui and bone-deep sadness that is the depression. any normal emotions; happiness, laughter, excitement, even just normal neutrality, all of those are foreign to me. i only feel them when i'm near someone else who is feeling them, and that's only because i've learned to mimic the behaviors associated with each emotion while in a social setting so nobody will ask what's wrong with me. is this a thing other people do? or am i just really fucked up?
does anyone else want to just sleep for a long, long time?
i wish i could hibernate. i don't want to die, i just want to go to bed for a couple months and come back to the world when i feel ready. 
does anyone else feel like they constantly need fresh starts?
it doesn't matter how hard i try, i just fuck up every relationship and friendship i'm in with everyone. i keep wanting fresh starts then it keeps crashing down.
where does my mental illness stop and my personality begin?
i hate my depression, but at the same time i am terrified of losing it. what would be left? my current life is the result of years of untreated depression and apathy, and that is what i have always been.
that's not how it works, asshole

this image always gives me strength when i feel like i want to give up. <3 u bob ross.

being suicidal is really scary because of how rational it feels in the moment
im not usually suicidal, im depressed but i only get suicidal when i have really bad days. and its really scary because in the moment it just feels like a rational and logical decision, that everything is hopeless and any motivation or happiness i may have felt was just me being naive and dumb. and then it lifts and i feel normal-ish again. it really scares me cause im afraid im going to go through with it one day.
i hate sleeping because it makes tomorrow come sooner.
i've noticed that a big symptom of depression that a lot of people have is excessive sleeping and depressed people often view sleeping as an escape. but for me, the thing i always dread most is tomorrow. i hate getting up and having to face the day, regardless of whether i slept. and sleeping makes it come so much faster. i don't know. does anyone else feel like this? or am i just weird
no social skills, no romance, no love. no hope for the future.
i'm a 33 year old male and i've been struggling with depression for the past 15 years of my life. it keeps getting worse one day at a time. i've always had severe social anxiety and did what i could to avoid talking to people. i tried dating a few times in my life but the relationship wouldn't last more than a few weeks. i would be extremely nervous and wouldn't know what to say but i would tell myself that every other guy on the planet can do this so i can too. it finally dawned on me that i have no social skills and can't hold conversation to save my life. you might think i'm over exaggerating but you'd be wrong. i really can't think of anything to say. even if you were to give me a list of things to say i'm not intelligent or quick witted enough to hold a 5 min conversation let alone hours upon hours of talking to someone i'm interested in. it's like my mind is a blank slate the never got programed. i tried therapy and meds but i finally realized it's hopeless. there is something severely wrong with my brain. i hate myself so much and i would do anything to be a normal guy with a normal love/sex life. i have a bunch of other problems that make me depressed but i've already written enough here. if you actually read all this, thanks for listening to me vent.
anyone else love sleeping and are sad when they wake?
i'm happy when i've been sleeping. no worries or cares from this life to bother me. then, i wake up and am sad. sad because i'm still alive. sad because i'm still the same me. all of the other issues in my life that make me depressed come back to mind and the joy that sleep brought slips away so quickly. 
i turned 65 today, and nobody cared
no calls, no cards, no emails - nothing. it's a big birthday. i always thought i'd be surrounded by my loved ones on my 65th birthday, but not one of them ever calls or writes or sends even a christmas card to me. one day i'm going to die in this goddamned apartment and nobody will know until they smell something bad and realize they haven't seen me for awhile. then they will all act so sad. i remember at my father's funeral, some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was. i looked at him and said who are you? and then i asked him if he was such a good friend, why don't i know you? i'm his daughter and i've never seen you in my life.when i die, nobody will come to my funeral. nobody will give a rat's ass that i am dead. that's why i'm donating my body to science.update: just want to thank everyone who posted well wishes or shared their life stories. i wish i had more time to answer all the replies. it really did lift my spirits, though, so you did what you intended to do. this is one reason i love reddit and why i love young people. they really have such good hearts, but i think maybe they don't want to face their own mortality quite yet, so they tend to turn away from older folks like me. i was the same way when i was younger.anyway, thanks again! 
does anyone smile and laugh as if its natural but feel nothing inside?
i do this all the time, like i really want that feeling of happiness so i smile, but it never comes.
do you ever wish you could run away and start over?
do you ever wish you just run away and start over? what would you do? 
ever realized that after you patted everyone's backs, no patted yours?
you helped everyone, gave em a smile! asked if they were okay! but then you realize that not a single one asked you back? friend or family? it's kinda lonely, some'll even call you stupid and say you wouldn't understand. well...it doesn't matter either way
anyone else so fuckin tired all the time?
after school i don’t feel like doing anything. i just wanna lay in my bed and sleep or watch netflix
i'm 24. my father died, my girlfriend left, my mother killed herself, and my sister was just admitted to a psych hospital. in the span of 4 months.
i've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; i suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. i guess i just need to get it all of my chest, and i apologize if it's a bit long. my parents divorced december 2012. after that, my father and i became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. my father was my mentor. he was my friend. he was a great man. in december of 2013, he passed away at 48. i'm 24. it was horrendous. i lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since i was the executor of his estate. a few weeks before his death, i began dating a girl. she was the perfect fit for me. she was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. when my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. she helped me through a lot. about a month and a half ago, she left. a half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now i'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. i was still not on good terms with my mom. she was not being a mother. she continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones i cared about. time and time again i gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. this past week, my mother committed suicide. she wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. she decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. my sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. it doesn't look promising. i sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. i'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. if you took the time to read this, i thank you. i just needed to vent. and to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as i have in the past, please please seek help. don't do this to those that care about you. edit: wow. i wrote this last night before getting some rest, and i woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. i can't tell you how much it means to me. for those that sent me pms, i will get back to you as soon as i can. thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. i'll be going through everyone's response today. 
why give me fucken mental illnesses and an ugly face and body? you couldn’t just give me one? fuck you.
sorry for the little rant. i’m poor and ugly. don’t hurt me.
does anyone else feel like crying sometimes but physically can’t
i want to cry so badly sometimes but my body just won’t let me 
doing nothing is boring but doing something is so hard
i'm so bored of just sitting in my room for the whole day watching youtube videos or lying in bed til it's nighttime and i can go to sleep again. but whenever i have something i need to do or when i was employed and working everyday it was so fucking difficult and i just wanted to die. 
do you ever stop and think “what the fuck am i doing”
then go right back to the empty feeling of nothing where you keep wasting life. seconds of snapping out of it then back to bring controlled by depression.  i hate that split second i open my eyes when i wake up 
the only reason i am still living is because i want to play more video games and watch more tv. i literally live in order to escape from living
this is a wretched fucking existence and i want to end it.
do you ever get it when you're feeling really fucking good but suddenly you realise that means your gonna be super fucking sad soon?

do you ever try and make someone feel better when they're dealing with problems and be all supportive on this sub then post about your problems that are usually quite similar?
i feel like i was about to do this and talk about how purposeless and lonely i am, after telling someone else they aren't alone and there are always people to help.edit: oh my god [wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h46frrvb-9o) ! this is the most upvotes i'll probably ever get i'm glad you guys know what i means <3 thank you
tonight's my final night
i sold my pc and drum kit for a handgun a couple days ago and i'm planning on using it tonight. i'm going for a long drive into a secluded area and ending it here. life is simple in the moonlight bye reddit.
anyone else here young but feel so old mentally, like they have been through war in their brain

does anyone else constantly joke about killing themselves?
has anyone ever asked if you’re ok? like, gee whoa, you certainly talk about killing yourself a lot. are you ok? 
the one aspect of depression that people don't talk about enough...
is how bloody incompetent it makes you. i'm stuck waiting outside my therapist's office for an hour, because i can't hold a time in my mind for literally the two minutes it takes to go from phone call to note app.i'm so much worse at literally everything.
i drew my depression.
today during class, i drew what depression is like for me. it sounds weird, but it made me feel better for a while. anyways, here it is. edit: thank you all for the kind words, i didn't expect such feedback! and thank you u/greydestruction for the gold, i've never had it before! it means a lot that you guys appreciate it, and i'm glad i made something finally that people like. thanks again, i love all of you and have a great weekend. :) 
whenever someone compliments me, i immediately becomes suspicious of their intent
3am again stuck in my own thoughts again.it seems i hold such a low opinion of myself, that i just can’t accept a compliment for what it is but rather find a reason to deflect it. do any of you feel this way? 
do you ever feel that when you're in your depression you see the world more clearly than other people?
i'm grateful for the times i'm *not* depressed and can function fairly normally, but i've noticed that when i'm in the midst of a depressive episode my thoughts about the world seem to be a lot more accurate (and bleak).  and then i wonder if it's better to be depressed and honest about life, or to be in la-la land.
does anyone else feel like they're a burden on their parents?
they spent so much time, money and effort for me to turn out like this. i wish i had to energy to work or go to school so i don't feel like i wasted their money to be a lazy fat ass who sleeps all day and eats their food. i don't have the energy to leave bed most days i don't even know how i can find a job or think of a career to study.
does anyone else spend most of their time laying in bed?
i don’t know how it got this bad. i’ve always struggled but this is on another level. i’ve spent almost the last 3 years in bed every single day and night. luckily i work from home, but i do that in bed as well. i realize it’s not healthy i just have no motivation. people have made jokes that there will be an indent in my bed from me never leaving it which is so embarassing. i don’t want to be like this anymore but i’m terrified of trying meds. i took them in high school and they made me almost manic. i said and did a lot of stupid things on them. i just want to feel normal again . 
math teacher made my day
today i was feeling shitty from the moment i woke up.nothing was going right. first i got yelled at by my mom, then i fucked up an important exam. i basically have a self-harm kit in my bag (razor in my phone case, gauzes and bandaids...) and i was really planning to just go and cut in the school bathrooms.but then math period came. i usually don't do anything in math and fuck up most of my exams there. but lately i've tried to understand what we were doing there. and today, the teacher told me to go solve a problem on the whiteboard.and after i solved it, my teacher said: see? you're really good at this!i almost fucking cried right there. i didn't actually feel like a worthless piece of shit for once. and you bet i didn't touch that razor today.some people dont know what even the smallest compliment can do to a person. so yeah, shoutout to my math teacher, she really made my day with this.
i’m lonely but i hate being around people.
what the fuck is wrong with my brain. 
why can’t i fucking do anything?
i have no interest in anything anymore. it just sucks. i sit around all day motionless occasionally maybe listening to two seconds of music but then turning it off after being unable to concentrate. i hate this.
i havent cut in a month!
i decided i was done cutting a month ago, and although i still really want to i haven't cut at all. my arms even look somewhat normal, which hasnt happened in years. just happy and felt the need to share it.
does anyone else ever feel...embarassed after opening up about their depression to someone?
i do feel relieved that someone knows now but i also feel kind of embarrassed that they had to see that side of me. i just feel vulnerable 
anyone else almost non-functional when they have freetime?
i recently got a 40 hour a week job, its been great, i wake up, go to work, go to sleep, repeat. when i am there i listen to music or a podcast and then i go home. once i get home, on the weekends, i am almost non-functional. i want to die so bad right now and the voices are once again coming back full force, beating me down to the point where i can't focus on anything, i just want to cry and sit in bed, or stab myself repeatedly with a knife. instead i sit in front of a computer and game for as long as i can. most of the time i am completely alone with my own thoughts on the weekend. even now my mind is yelling at me. i dread the weekends. 
you don't realize how much your depression is effecting your life until you finally make progress and your two year old points at you, smiles, and says mommy's happy!! life changing.

congrats to me...
i brushed my hair for the first time in a week.
i fear that i use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities.
hello everyone. first off, as i'm sure is the case for most of you, this post was extremely hard to write. i don't like complaining about my depression/anxiety because life is stressful for everybody. i am in a pretty good situation overall, with a good family, great girlfriend, great friends, and a nice apartment. yet, despite all that, i feel so incredibly shitty most of the time. it makes me feel guilty - why should i feel like crap when i have it so much better than probably 99% of the world? yeah, everyone gets stressed by work, traffic, money, etc but it's called life. these are thoughts i have all the time which is why i don't like to talk about my feelings much. i see a therapist and i don't really mind bitching to him because he gets paid to listen to me. but i absolutely hate talking about it otherwise. the thought of making my problems other people's problems is horrible to me. another thought that i have is do i just use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? like am i just not mature enough to deal with real life so i can just say to myself hey i'm depressed so it's okay that i don't give maximum effort? i am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating.  i often just think i'm incredibly lazy and that i use depression as an excuse which in turn gets me more depressed. has anyone had these thoughts before (and apologies if this has been discussed in this subreddit - i'm brand new here). i just don't feel like i'm cut out to deal with the real word. i don't have whatever it is to be successful professionally - between social anxiety, inability to concentrate, and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive.anyway, thanks for reading. i know this is a giant ramble. glad to have somewhere i can just write down all my incoherent thoughts
one day, that quiet kid will commit suicide
one day, that quiet kid will commit suicide, and come his funeral, his parents and siblings will be crying. but none of his classmates will say a word because they never spoke to him. they will remember the times their eyes moved past him as if he were part of the wallpaper. how many times they forgot he was in the room. isn't it tragic that the only time they remembered he was with them at all was the day he left the world? good luck to you, fellows, who are like me. depressed and lonely, and waiting for the end of it to come.
while others are out making memories they will cherish forever, i am rotting away in my room alone
i wish i could rewind at times and fix this mess. i see all these lives i could have lived and i fucking hate myself. i think about all the things i did wrong and things i should have did but i didn't. 
does anyone else feel like they’re in a trance, of sorts? as if they’re just floating through life - which feels intangible in itself - with very little or no purpose?
that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself in a mirror and am reminded i am in fact a genuine, human person.my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it’s inhabitants - that it’s all fake, in a way, and everything is very much temporary, having no long lasting impact - probably doesn’t help this feeling. it’s not a lack of awareness; i’m almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. just a constant state of being “out of it”.i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)edit: wow i forget how awful of a typist i am. i must learn to proofread for the amount of typos i make hahaedit ii: i’m surprised this post has gained so much recognition in such a short space of time. although it’s sad that a lot of us seem to be struggling with this, at least we’re not alone (ew, cheesiness)edit iii: some people seem to think i’m a guy in the comments, which is fine (i don’t mind!), but i wonder why because i’m a girl haha. thank you again for all the upvotes and comments on this.
anybody else regret opening up to some people
i feel like they didnt deserve to know me like that, some are too ignorant to deserve it.
people say you can't kill yourself, but then they disappear when you need help. fuck everyone.

today i woke up without hitting the snooze button, actually made myself coffee, did homework i could have put off, and showered standing up!
i feel so proud of myself for not letting myself succumb to the depression today and actively fighting my lethargy! even though i know that tomorrow morning i might disappoint myself, i won today's battle. try to remember that every proactive thing you do (no matter how small, like making coffee) is a huge personal success! (to clear things up, i have taken to sitting in the shower since summer was over due to a lack of willpower/energy which results in longer, depressing showers instead of invigorating like a shower should be)edit: so happy to see that my post has inspired others and thank you all for the congratulations and encouraging words :) this subreddit is truly a wonderful and supportive community
i sleep with a stuffed animal to feel less lonely
im a 19 year old male. i sleep with a stuffed animal and i cuddle with it and talk to it like it's a girl. i literally can't fall asleep if i don't do this and it makes me feel so fucking pathetic. i honestly cant think of a less pathetic thing for someone to do. what the fuck is wrong with me?edit: holy shit i can't believe there is so many people that do this... you guys are all so kind and wholesome and i feel so much better about at least this small thing. <3
many people i know wear i spend tons of hours at my job and i'm constantly exhausted like a badge of honor. i feel like i'm watching a group of masochists all slamming their heads off a brick wall, and then celebrating the person who can punish themselves the most/endure the most pain

anyone else feel like you have to be physically ill to make people realize you’re mentally ill?
i have depression since childhood and nothing has ever been done until i cut my wrist once. i hate selfharming. i never had an urge to do it, but it did feel like something you had to do to ‘prove’ you’re depressed, especially when you’re a teenager. if not, you’re seen as someone who’s just sensitive and complains a lot. other illnesses like anorexia also seem ‘necessary’ to have to make people finally realize that you’re mentally unwell. even my own parents saw my suicidal thoughts as an afterthought at first. when i confessed to my teachers about my selfharming, they finally tried to find a therapist for me. 
today is my birthday. the first recognition of that was by google at 1:30pm.
january was incredibly difficult. february is proving almost as bad. i don't know if i'll make it to see spring.
sorry i didn't reply, i was taking a nap
is really just code for sorry i didn't reply, i didn't have the energy to talk to anyone or engage in any sort of human contact so i laid in bed for 4+ hours, in the middle of the day, listening to music and thinking about how horrible everything is.me right now.
anybody else just used to being depressed and accept that's how it is?
i've reached that point in my life, where not feeling depressed feels weird to me.  i'm just so used to that numbing feeling of uuuugh, that to actually think of life without depression just makes me roll my eyes.  like that will ever be possible.  i can never just be happy.  there always seems to be some sort of catch.  happiness seems to come at a price.i've also noticed that after feeling happy, that i just *crash* hard back into depression and i feel worse than before.  i sometimes compare happiness to a hard drug.  the high is amazing and uplifting, but you fall from that high deeper into depression and you crave that happiness.  i'm also anxious 95% of the time, even when i have no responsibilities or things to worry about.  i could be sitting down on my bed listening to music and then be having an intense panic attack.  i dunno, this might all just be me.  i just wanted to vent.
the internet has turned depression into a meme and i hate it.
it's practically impossible to have a serious discussion about it with anyone because if you say you're depressed and feel like dying they're always like lol me too xd
“the best way to describe depression is the inability to construct a future.

it’s all fucking commercialized shit. fake joy. artificial happiness. fake fake fakeand fuck people who say you can choose to be happy. if that was true then depression wouldn’t fucking existfuck everything
being african-american and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is
i just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesn't discriminate when it chooses its victims, i am just speaking from my perspective.in no way am i saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a real issue. from my personal experience and those of other black people i know, majority of us grew up being told that we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason. i am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.recently, i have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. i was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. after the school year ended, i came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. the claim that going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). all they want to do is put people on pills. that is the furthest thing from the truth. not once did the man i met with suggested that i be placed on any sort of medication and even if i were, i would be willing to if i needed it.i hate that i am nothing like my family. if i believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. but i am at the point in my life where i feel that i want to believe in what feels right for me. i want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.i just wish that my parents and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their minds to the fact that acknowledging mental health is not a bad thing!update: i thank and commend all of you for sharing your experiences in the comments. in the place of “african-american” i originally had “person of color” because i am aware that this problem  is very relevant within other groups. this was basically me speaking from personal experience and you all have definitely opened my eyes to what other groups endure.stay strong everyone. no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, your problems do not deserve to be invalidated or told they are not real. i am proud of you all ❤️
sleep isn't just sleep anymore. it's an escape.

i am in shock.
today at work my boss told me that she had a special job for me to do. she introduced me to a new hire (who is my age) and asked me to show her around. she was to hang out with me all night. turns out we seemed to have a lot in common and we got along pretty well. we both left at the same time and when we walked out she asked me for my number. i'm just in total shock that anyone would like me enough to ask for my number, my awkward depressed self. totally weird
do you ever start thinking about someone and then realise they aren't thinking about you?
i always catch myself thinking about someone and how much i like their company or attention, but then self-doubt creeps into my head and i realise that i don't even cross their minds. it makes me feel weird and lonely, i always start to feel real shitty. anyone else?&#x200b;sorry if nobody gives a fuck or this is the wrong sub reddit, i just want to know if anyone else experiences this.
idk
the thing is, you don’t want to sleep,but you don’t want to be awake.you don’t want to eat.but you don’t want to be hungry.you don’t want to be around people, but you don’t want to be alone you don’t want to do anything,but you don’t want to do nothing.what you really want is to stop existing,but you can’t do that without dying,and you don’t really want to do that either.
wake up, neglect appearance and hygiene, play video games to escape life, watch anime in bed at night on my phone to escape the emptiness until i fall asleep. repeat.
this has been my routine for a while now. add in toilet breaks and eating food on the side. sometimes i watch tv too and on days i'm feeling perky i brush my teeth and have a shower! pushing the boat out right?living life on the very edge here. or merely just killing time. i'll go with the latter. i don't feel very alive even gaming is more of a crutch to me than enjoyment.
i've always had trouble articulating the severity of my depression, so i made some photographs that describe it instead. thought you might enjoy.
i've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. i started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. however, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. how do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? it's not like i really knew the other side, so to speak. it was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.so…i made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how i feel. i've always been a more visual person anyway. hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. let me know what you think![link to the pictures](http://edwardandrew.tumblr.com/post/86363961861/last-year-i-posted-a-small-series-of-images-that)
does anyone else feel like that they've become a shell of their former self?
i feel like over the years, through a mix of some events that shook me, and secluding myself in my room, that i'm no longer the person i once was. i seem to have lost my personality completely, i don't act the way i used to. i rarely have anything to talk about and i can no longer make people laugh. i also feel myself becoming too cynical of recent, and i'm starting to think i've become unlikable.   i have always been an awkward person, but as of recent i feel everything has just gotten so much worse.
my interpretation of depression. (watercolor 9x11)

the only upside to having both anxiety and depression is that depression keeps me from doing things that will trigger the anxiety, and the anxiety keeps me from actively trying to kill myself.
i didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but i am realizing this right now as i'm in the middle of a crisis. i'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. because i don't live alone, i feel like i wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. i don't want to be seen, i don't want to be acknowledged. the attention i would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if i think about it now. just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, i try not to think about my death. while the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. so i guess that's a good thing, isn't it?   edit: oh wow, you guys. i was not expecting all of this at all. i wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown, while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning. i'm sorry it took me so long to come back to this post. but thank you so much for the replies. i have read all of them, and will reply. i hope all of you have a great, great day. let's keep our heads high! :)
anyone else been depressed since childhood?
i don't see it being discussed much. it makes me feel rather isolated. i don't think i even remember joy. i only seem to recall fear and deep sadness. i've been depressed since i was 9. i suppose i was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. a lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. an inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. most people my age (i'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but i only feel helpless. i am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like i can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world. depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me. i have a rather vapid life with a personality to match. i'd be open to read your experiences and feelings! edit: wow, words cannot describe how relieved and elated i feel to know that i am not alone. all of you have dealt with such terrible experiences i wish no one had to go through. i wish all of you nothing but the best! i am exhausted on all planes of existence, but i will use what strength i have to carry on. we must all move on. 
i'm desperate, please don't ignore
i can't think, concentrate, focus, i'm anxious, scared and feel like i've gone mad, my imagination is gone, i can't day dream or be creative, i can't function, i can't relax, i can't feel calm, my memory exists but recall doesn't work, i can't play games, or read long things, my inner monologue has disappeared and left me, i'm terrified.. i don't feel like myself, i feel i've been declining since february, depression or stress? but never been like this.. this has come on over the past 7\-10 days.. it's a leap from rough days to feeling mad, i don't know what this is and my google searches are not helping.. i need help.. and some peace of mind, has anyone gone through this? is this familiar to anyone, i've never heard anything like this before, like my mind has betrayed me.. or just, given up on me.i'm so fucking confused and scared, is this just me? anyone else?
are weekends really hard for anyone else?
i work 8 to 5 monday through friday waiting for the weekend. then every weekend i'm alone and empty. life sucks. 
7 years ago, i never thought that i would have considered suicide to get out of homework.
really, i just want to die anyway, but more and more often lately that’s my number one failsafe. “don’t want to do work today? just kill yourself.”“can’t be fucked exercising? just die.”then i realise i’m tethered to life by the people that love me most. fuck i wish they hated me so i could just be done with this already.

i stay up late at night, not because i enjoy being awake, but because i dread the next day.
i want to delay tomorrow as much as possible. i get little sleep and feel like crap in the morning. it would be nice if someone put a gun to my head & pulled the trigger while i slept. it would be the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me./* edit: really surprised so many of you feel the same way! it's 3am goodnight*/
when you have depression, a very good day is a happy persons normal day.
and very good days are rare.
ever start writing a post and just delete it because you feel like a failure for not getting attention even in here
i know getting votes and attention isn't everything but being very self-conscious about not being interesting sometimes i delete posts mid-writing even in this sub because i feel like a failure when no one replies. sorry this isn't meant as a call for attention either i just have no one to share these feelings with
yesterday, was my 14th birthday. got absolutely nothing.
so yesterday was my 14th birthday, got up in a good mood looking forward to it just to find that none of my friends really did care, same for my family. my family mainly just ignored me that day. but on that day they bought my older brother, younger brother some stuff likes clothes and video games (rounded up to $500 all together). but even though it was my birthday they didn't get me anything not a cake, not a hug, not even a simple happy birthday or love you. just ignored me. but not going to complain since it's been like this for years and i was abused in all ways as a child by them, i was also called the problem and interference between them.anyways whoever's read this have a good day. :)
anyone else wish they could just die in their sleep?
like not so much actively suicidal as just kind of like, it would be super convenient if i didn't wake up in the morning?lately i feel this way every night.
knowing that i can kill myself is the only thing that keeps me relaxed.
so, as in the title, one of the few things that makes me not fall in complete despair is knowing that i do have this way out. just want to know if anyone knows what i'm talking about. like, it came to a point where thinking about suicide actually comforts me enough to not do it. am i a idiot for thinking this way?
i'm the funny guy. i instinctively put on this act to make everyone laugh. yet i really want someone to just see through my bullshit and understand how deeply sad i am.
when i'm around other people, i laugh boisterously and crack jokes like it's my fucking job. people think i'm this confident, hilarious guy who enjoys the fuck out of life. of course, i can't blame them. i mean, i'm full of shit. that's the image i project. i can't help it. i just do it without thinking about it. but all i really want is for someone to understand the crippling melancholy that forms the foundation of all my jokes. i want someone to see through it all and just acknowledge how fucking hopelessly sad i am. the hilarious thing is that all it takes is a bit of honesty. yet honesty feels completely unnatural to me. i can't be honest about my feelings. i just can't. i can face a wall and tell it about how miserable i am. but replace that wall with an actual human being, and suddenly it becomes impossible. i *pay* my therapist to listen to my true feelings, but as absurd as it is, i can't even bring myself to tell him just how dark my inner world has become.i'm sad, internet strangers. i'm really fucking sad. all the time. 
the only reason i haven’t tried to kill myself is because it would destroy my parents.
my mom is my best friend in the entire world and i couldn’t do that to her. i wish i could.
scared of helping people here.
i just want to say to everyone here that didn't get a response to their post, i'm sorry. i'm sure there are tons of us. too scared, anxious to respond. from time to time i just go here and read people stories, their life and their problems. most of us here have similiar problems and i'm 100% sure even though you may have not got a response you were hoping for, that there are people reading your stories, your problems and that they would want nothing more but for you to get better, even though they are too scared to respond.
your 'friends' say i'm always here for you next thing you know you share your feelings and drive everyone away
fucking sick of this happening to me all the time
my parents and only sister died in a car accident. i am 20.
it had been 4 months since i woke up to my uncle’s call telling me what happened. i feel so lost, i thought it will only get better but it doesn’t. i lie to my therapist so she wouldn’t ask to see me more. i lie to my friends. i have no other family. i have never been close to my uncles and aunts. my parents were everything in me and my sister’s lives. i never imagined life would be this hard. i never thought there is a jungle out here. i need someone who felt/feels the same to tell me that it will get better. i don’t want to feel alone in this. 
is there anyone here who is about to write a text post about their problems but then erases it because you feel like you're unnecessarily whining?
i do it many times. posting this alone was a struggle. 
does anyone use video games as a form of escapism?

litter saved my life.
i was in my car this morning ready to kill myself (or at least trying i always chicken out). i went out driving looking for something like a bridge or a really sturdy tree so i wouldn't have to take anyone with me. that's when i drove by this massive littering is illegal sign and guess what? there's a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign! at this point i was beginning to somewhat calm down. i turned around and parked on the side of the road. i picked up litter for about 30-60 mins in the hot southern sun. luckily i had a cheap duffel bag i wasn't using. felt like i lost a pint of sweat (my fatass sweats a lot). after that i just got in my car and drove home. it's kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me.edit: thanks for the gold
my. mental. illness. does. not. make. me. weak.
my grandma said i can’t handle things well. she doesn’t even know what i went through. i hate it when people judge without even having all the information. and of course she went on to talk about her own problems, and how she thinks of herself as a superhero for going through them. i love her, but that’s lame.
is anyone else high achieving when not depressed, but absolutely broken and non-functional when depressed?
haha. kill me 
do you ever feel ashamed to be in public?
like you’re just so ugly and awkward and disgusting that you should never show your face again. like you’re an embarrassment to the word human. and people are just getting second hand embarrassment just from knowing you’re in the room.
i told a girl i liked her. she doesn't feel the same as i do but it's the most alive i've felt in years.

does anyone else crave attention
like getting a text, a snapchat from a friend would feel so good right now. i mean just to know someone is thinking of me or wants to talk to me is the best feeling. i feel so replaceable because i know people can easily live without me. sorry for the pity party but i wanted to get that out and see if anyone else can relate
first thought after waking up: i can't wait to go back to sleep
the first few hours in the morning are almost unbearable...
anyone else feel like they will inevitably end up killing themselves?
it feels like i already know how i’m gonna die— suicide. i can do all i can to prevent it from happening, but it’s like a curse that can’t be broken. i can’t escape this fate. terrifyingly, this is becoming the reality, the longer i live, the more i want to kill myself. now, it’s just a matter of figuring out when.
spending new years in the hospital
i’m typing this from the waiting room of the er. i finally decided to get help. i’ve checked myself in for suicidal ideation. i’ll be spending new year’s eve and new year’s day in a hospital. i’m really proud of myself for mustering up the courage to ask my mom to drive me here. i hope this experience will finally help me in someway. i hope you all enjoy your new years festivities. edit: today, january 4th, i got discharged! thank you all so much for your kind words. spending 4 days disconnected from the outside world was tough but i know now it was absolutely necessary for me. please get the help you all deserve. i'll be in an iop (intensive out-patient program) for the next 6 weeks, i've started medication and for once i can say i have hope for the future. here's to recovery in 2019.
i wish i could give my life span to someone that was taken too early that deserved to live.
i just watched the andy whitfield documentary be here now. he was the title role of spartacus in the starz series years back. the show was a hit and he was no doubt destined to do great things moving forward, but he was suddenly diagnosed with lymphoma cancer and died 18 months later. he left behind a beautiful wife and two children. he seemed to have been a decent and talented guy all alround and did not deserve to die.i'm just a 27 year old pos working a crappy job and getting drunk every night. i'm short and ugly and will never find a women to start a family with. why did a great guy like andy have to die instead of me? fuck cancer.
does anyone feel like they’re not going anywhere in life?
i’ve felt like this for quite some time and can’t quite shake it off.
wife is dying and i feel so lonely.
i've suffered with depression all my life, i was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like i didn't fit in. my wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. i can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. we lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.during this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. after four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.last month i took my wife to a&e because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.she is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. she has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while i sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.the trouble is i can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but i'm devastated and alone. besides, how i feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and i don't want to put that on her.i feel like i'm already grieving her even though she is still here, i'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.i've already lost so much and i don't know how i am going to cope when i'm here alone. i feel like i'll probably just see out my cats life and then take my own, nothing feels worth doing if i can't share it with her.
that fucked up moment when you realize even suicide is not an option.
when you can't come up with an answer to what to do? question. when nothing is getting any better but you still keep on going for no particular reason. when you ran out of hope and started to exist like a zombie. fuck, i'm really feeling like shit. 
does anyone else excessively browse reddit so they don't have to think about anything else?
i spend all day on reddit so i don't have to think about things that stress me out. the stupid thing is that there are things that i want to do, yet i always put them off until tomorrow. i've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. i have a tablet and can download photoshop for free from my university, yet i haven't drawn a single panel. if i can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am i going to survive life?i'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. before winter break, i promised myself that i'd apply for the study abroad program that i need for graduation, but i haven't started that either. i'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since i haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. i know i need to just do it, but the more i put it off, the more anxious i get.**edit:** wow, this post got so much more attention than i was expecting. i'm really glad to know that i'm not the only one struggling with this. that being said, i think it's time for me to really make an effort to disconnect myself from reddit. to help me in this process, i'm going to be deleting this account, so i'll have less of an attachment here. i've read every one of your posts here. thank you for sharing your experiences and opinions, and i wish you all the best in overcoming your struggles.
my ex texted me i don't give a fuck even if you die
so there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. i'd always apologize even if i was wrong. i refused to apologize and it all fucked up. she knew i had depression when we were in relationship. i told her i feel depressed and she said there's no such thing as depressionanyway, she found out from out our common friend that i visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. so at the end of the chat,i told her i'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said i don't give a fuck even if you diei stopped texting her after that. i was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, i fucking won't. fuck you.. i'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.edit: just came home and saw your replies. i'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. in the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if i can help one person, i'd be the happiest person in this world.
meeting a former bully
i just found out that my hairdresser is one of the people who bullied me a lot earlier in my life. i didn't recognise him, but he suddenly asked if i was dnali3n, and we had a long talk while he did his job. he apologised for what he did and how he acted, and it removed a big load from my heart. just wanted to share a ray of sunshine
it's so hard to get out of bed.
i've spent 4 hours lying on the bed this afternoon. it's so hard to convince yourself because there's nothing to look forward to, nobody to talk to and you cannot find the reason for self-care. it's easier to stay in bed and struggle about things like self-hatred, sexuality, all the types of relationships and the future than to take steps to improve the situation. it's so hard when you have no emotional support, nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through things with you, step-by-step. nobody's listening.i'm aware that i cannot and should not rely on other for validation, and i cannot seek their help all the time. i'm aware that only i can change things. but as soon as i'm trying to be independent, everything just falls apart immediately. why am i like this? i just want the demons to go away. i don't need to be happy, i just want this to stop.
my depression makes me want to be alone, and makes me lonely.
what the hell is this bullshit.edit: thank you for the gold. it's very kind.
no matter how early i go to bed, when i wake up it feels like my battery is at 50%, feeling like i want to stay forever in bed, so i try to rest a little bit and stand up after several minutes.

does anyone else get jealous?
i get jealous of other people’s abilities, talents, and achievements, since i have none. i also get terribly depressed when i hear stories of other people’s supportive families, their possessions. this makes me seem toxic and irritated out in public, when in fact i’m trying to cope with my worthlessness. i especially can’t stand people who have a tendency of humbly or subtly bragging. those people make me feel like absolute shit. does anyone else experience this... sense of loss? is it valid, or am i acting like an asshole? 
i get really uncomfortable when people ask me where do you see yourself in 5 years?
because i just hope i don't lol
i forgot where i live
i have a brain tumor and the doctors told me my memory is going to get worse and worse. at first it was only little things, but today my friend was driving me home and i totally forgot where i lived. my road that i have lived on for my whole life seemed totally new. i had to think really hard to remember which house was mine. i've been crying for the past 4 hours over it.
did you ever feel like your depression is fake?
did any of you ever thought about you depression beeing fake and you just make it up to get attention? or am i the only one feeling like that
i won't commit suicide but i wouldn't mind dying
so much shit has been piling on and on. i feel like i am not making the people i care about proud and the only reason they talk to me is because of pity. i am scared of not being able to reach the expectations my parents have of me.i will not take my own life, but if a car hit me, i got a terminal illness or if something fell on top of me. i would not be sad about me being gone.
anyone else feel like they're just living the same day over and over?
i feel like for as long as i have been depressed, i am  reliving the same day over and over again. sometimes i just watch the clock change from 11:59 pm to 12:00 am and see the date change and think yup, another day feeling the same way. time is moving forward and i am not. 
i wish suicide was easier
i tried to hang myself today but i was too scared. it's a painful way to die. i wish i wasn't scared of the pain. i want to die so badly. i wish i had a gun or poison. there are so many people on this planet anyway and death is just a part of life. i wish i could just buy a pill.edit: thank you for your kind words. i really appreciate them. it's good to be reminded that i'm not alone and other people struggle with this too. to those telling me to see a therapist, i am in therapy and have been in therapy for 10 years . i am currently on medication, just increased my dosage about a month ago actually and have a doctor's appointment scheduled for next week. i've been in this battle for a long time, i've worked hard, i've tried many things and sometimes suicide feels like the only rational option.
i dont want to kill myself. i just don't want to exist
i dont want to exist. i dont want to deal with all these emotions. i hate myself. i know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. i dont want to kill myself. it would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. i'm an accident. nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. i wasn't meant to exist so why am i here? if i wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. i just wish i didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyone
do you ever read/watch a really good story about friendship or love and then get sad because you realize its probably never going to happen to you?
feel like all the best parts about life i can only dream about.
does anyone have a completely normal day but still think of killing themselves?
like i dont feel like i have any problems, but the thought of killing myself just doesnt go away.
you can talk to me about anything! :d
biggest fucking lie i've ever heard. 
does anyone hate not having anything to do, but at the same time, can't stay productive when there is something to do?
my life is a mess right now. everyone's ignoring me, and i can't stand being by myself. but at the same time, i want to be kept alone.i don't know what i want to do, but even if i try something, i can't push myself to stay productive.what am i even doing to push my life forward?!sometimes i feel so useless. even i don't know what i want.
news flash!!!
hey people without depression who think i'll be cured by working out and eating better guess what!!! it doesn't cure it!! i run every other day and eat healthy with lots of vegetables, i journal, i do yoga, i go to individual and group therapy, i'm on medicine, hell i even have an essential oil diffuser to make my room smell nice. i make my bed and clean my room every day and stretch out morning and nights.all neurotypical minds probably think i should be not depressed right now but guess what i still am!!! doing all those healthy things makes my overall mood higher but it doesn't cure what's going on in my brain. i just want people to know that i'm trying hard and i still am not on neurotypical level like they want me to be. thanks for coming to my ted talk
life is too hard for me.
you have to take care of your body. brush your teeth, shave, shower, get regular haircuts. eat varied, healthy meals. exercise regularly. you need a varied and fashionable wardrobe for social occasions.you need money to support yourself and your lifestyle. you have to work or study for years to advance in anything that's not a dead end career. you have to deal with your boss, with your coworkers, with your clients. you have to deal with a thousand other people in a cutthroat environment who all want the same job or that promotion. you have to devote at least 40 hours a week to this, sometimes more.you need to develop your identity and your personality. find what interests you and pursue it. have hobbies, read books, be an interesting person. you have to maintain a social life on top of all this. you have your family, your friends, your significant other. birthdays, anniversaries, thanksgivings, christmases. mandatory social obligations. gifts. money. endless conversation. most of it is fake. there are so many unspoken rules and customs involved in social interaction and you're not allowed to show weakness. it's a constant, tiring charade and everybody knows it's an act but it goes on and on and on.this is a fucking rat race. it's too much responsibility, too much chaos. i can't handle it all. how do people do it? i don't think i was meant to be human.
happy birthday, u/feelingdepressed, i told you i'd remember! :)
in july 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and i just wanted to say:have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! i know this year has sucked, and i'm here to let you know that it will work out, and if i care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in july, others do too. stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and please don't end yourself because you do matter! we love you! 
depression is humiliating
it turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. it affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. it scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. you alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. you become pathetic and you know it. and you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. you have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. so you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. if you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. no one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. it’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. it’s an incapacity to function. at all. no one chooses it. no one deserves it. it runs in families, it ruins families. you cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. depression is real. compassion is also real. and a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. have a heart. 
is anyone else always tired?
and i’m not talking about tired of life (well not mostly.) i’m tired. all the time. no matter what i try to do, i can’t stop being tired. exercise? tired. stay in bed all day? tired. try to socialize? tired. be alone? tired. eat or not? doesn’t matter. tired. not matter how much or how little i sleep, i’m tired. i can’t find fun in anything anymore.
does anyone with depression forget their memories?
i've noticed for a while that i'm forgetting things very easily. i can't remember the good memories i had with my friends whenever they bring up some past event. it's like my head is just erasing all of the memories i have, and it's making me more depressed than i already am. does anyone else notice this too?i thought maybe it has to be with depression, at least  it's my guess. otherwise it could be just me.
anyone else feel horrible about wasting their youth?
i'm 20 and i feel like absolute shit. this past year i've been doing nothing and i've been letting my illness ruin my life completely. i could have been doing something, anything, but i let it all go away.i'm trying to make the most of my time now, but, it's hard, and i feel so bad... and i feel like i'm out of time and i can't have the experience i could've had. and most of all, i don't want to get older.
depression and social anxiety have turned me into such an uninteresting person.
the worst thing about these two things together is how boring i must be to other people. i'm either too afraid to do things with people and don't like myself enough to engage in social activities, or i'm so depressed that i don't have the energy for it. if i do try doing things, i feel like i'm faking some bullshit personality anyways. i would 100% change my personality if i could, but it just always gets too uncomfortable too handle. being alone is comfortable and familiar.
it came back. it always comes back.
i was doing so well. i was excited to be alive for the first time in many, many years. i thought i had finally begun a new, positive chapter in my life.  boy was i wrong.  i'm sinking back into the depths of this insidious disease and losing my will to fight it. the older i get, the more i see suicide as an inevitability.  i was not made for this world.  i'm lonely. i'm lost. i'm afraid. and, above all else, i'm tired.  what a cruel joke to be ripped from the womb and thrust into this absolute wasteland.  welcome to hell.
depression feels like you're drowning and no one wants to save you.
most days i feel like i'm in the middle of the ocean, gasping for air as i bob up and down trying to scream for help. yet yards away are a beach, a beach of my friends and family. they know the signs, they know what drowning looks like, yet they do nothing. just stare. just stare as i try to keep my head above water. no matter how hard i scream, no matter how much i wave my arms hoping for someone to notice and help me out. no one moves.its just me. alone. in the middle of the ocean. praying i can just keep my head above water for at least a day.
who else is spending nye alone?
i’m gonna be all by myself on nye. i keep telling myself that nye is overrated just to make myself feel better. but who am i kidding? i hope you guys have a good one and a happier one than mine!
for those of you who have been diagnosed with depression, did you ever feel like you didn't want to feel/get better?
now first off i feel it's imperative to say that i haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact i haven't even talked to anyone about how awful i've been feeling the past year or so.  however i feel i definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, i do not feel suicidal at all).i suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but i was thinking that if i did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication i would not feel comfortable with taking it.  i mean for one, i have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  even just talking to someone i feel like i wouldn't properly be able to open up about what i've been going through. ...and sometimes i feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that i'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  i mean, there are times where i am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  i feel like i'm feeling sorry for myself.  i mean i have a great job, i'm only 23, i make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  but something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   it seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication i just need an escape via some new activity or something.  i just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible.
i raised my hand and spoke up in class.
after having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what i did today made me extremely happy. i hope i keep doing better.edit: thank you for all the support! i think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. i love this community.
you know what kills me about being depressed, and how people view me/us? please read this. directed to all of you.
is that depressed people are honestly some of the nicest, open-minded, loving people i have ever met/talked to. we all know how it feels to be in the darkest places, and we don't want to see anybody go through that. i feel like a lot of us would stand by somebody and help them through anything they needed. whether it be big or small, depressed people know that there is no such thing as a big or small problem. problems are problems. people just like to point and act like they know what we are going through. like we are the mud on the bottom of the shoe, and can't lighten up. i really don't know any of you, but i already know that you are all some of the best people out there. i know how strong you all are, how loving you all are, how open-minded you all are. in some weird, seemingly contradictory way, you all are the love that is needed in the world.  nobody wants to talk to a depressed person, but a depressed person would talk to anybody.
i've skipped work and laid in bed for 3 days straight. i don't know what to do. i just have no motivation to get up in the morning.
this is becoming a problem. this is not the first time this has happened either. i am surprised i have not been fired. i just can't get up. i am so unmotivated. help! what can i do?edit: i am currently in therapy twice a week and taking antidepressants. i also have been working with my dr. to get a healthier diet and exercise routine. all of these things have help a lot. but i still can't seem to get up and face the day. 
i realised depression makes me only try to re-live old memories, and never new ones.
every week i buy a packet of strawberry bon bon's from the same shop because i did that every week when i was 12 and i associate the flavour and the smell with coming home from school, excited to spend the weekend playing video games.i buy an energy drink every wednesday because that was the night i used raid with my old wow guild. best times of my teenage years, and every wednesday i had an energy drink alongside me. i'll probably do it tomorrow, too.i stay up until 5am regularly because i long to feel like i did when i was 14 and i remember staying up watching old movies i'd never seen before. i no longer get that sense of awe.i used to eat pizza from the same place because i used to do it with my old band. the only place we ever went to and whenever i eat there i feel like i'm back in those days. occasionally i walked the same route home that i did in high school so i can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl i fancied on msn. that was a decade ago, though. msn doesn't exist, she's moved on and i don't have anything to look forward to. the pizza place shut down recently, new management who can't make pizza worth shit. i fucking cried because i felt like that part of my life was finally gone. i wondered if, in 10 years, i'd be doing the same things but to re-live the memories i'm making now. i don't know if i will.depression has successfully taken away my ability to make new memories. now my old ones are becoming harder to hold on to.**edit:** hey everyone. i woke to an overwhelming response, thank you all for kind words, advice and for sharing your own tales of nostalgia. this is a hard subject for me, i look forward to the future but the past is special and i never want it to go away entirely. i'm not one for unique experiences, the memories i have were never holidays or the first time i kissed someone or when i left high-school, but rather a broad feeling because at some point there was a part of my life that was really good and even though doing it once was fun, doing it over and over and over again cemented it into my head as a source of overwhelming positivity. hopefully by making broader improvements to my life they'll start to form again.i'll continue to read the comments for as long as this post remains relevant. thank you, if anyone else is trying to get one over on depression too, i'm right along with you.
i can't kill myself because of my cat.
i realized that today. this little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. she even learned how to give human hugs. everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. i never saw her do that to anyone or anything. just me. not always, but most of the times, when i'm stressed or i feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. almost everynight. today, i felt suicidal since the morning and i was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. it turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back. as ridiculous as it sounds, i don't want to cause any harm to this little thing and that's what keeps me alive. 
i graduated from college
i didnt go to any parties or share anything on social media, but i did it. i really didnt think i would make it through the semester, but i survived.
i can’t “do” self care
i know that it’d help... but it’s so difficult for me to clean, cook, whatever. i get fearful of it, actually, find myself tearing up whenever i tell myself i have to clean, change the sheets, do laundry, etc. i know this is a common symptom of depression, blah blah, but my life is spiraling and i wish i could take some control by having a clean environment, but this fear / anxiety is overwhelming. :(
anyone else feel like your “friends” aren’t really your friends at all?
i feel like all my friends hate me. the people that truly know me resent me. i feel my presence isn’t enjoyed — just tolerated. i’m the clown of my group. i’m always the butt of their jokes. but yet they always want to hang out. probably because i’m too nice. probably because i have a car and everyone just uses me for a ride. i don’t know who’s really there for me and who’s just taking advantage of me. i’m better off alone. i don’t even know how to have a friend...
3 years ago i nearly killed myself. 2 years ago i posted some drawings here. now i have some more.
hello everyone! about two years ago, on the anniversary of a near-suicide attempt, i posted an album here of different drawings i had made to cope over the year. the response was overwhelmingly positive and really encouraged me to continue pursuing my art. a lot of time has passed since then, and i’ve gotten a lot healthier as well as more skilled artistically, as it really helps me express myself in a positive way.this project has taken me about 6 months to complete, and it’s been hard, but has really given me purpose and meaning. i cannot thank you all enough, for the role you have played in encouraging me to take this thing art thing more seriously. it has revolutionized my mental health.so this project is something i've been working on for a while lately. it's called the banality of monsters, and it's ten ballpoint pen drawings, each with a corresponding text piece, telling a story about depression. don't worry, i'm not selling this project or anything, i want it all to be free. i just want to draw. it gives me purpose. thank you all so much for your support.ps: if this is something that seems to be harmful to the community, please let me know and i’ll take it down.
i couldn’t kill myself tonight.
10 minutes ago, i sat down on my bed, i had my 9mm cocked. i held my gun next to my head but never actually pointed at my head.i was scared. i couldn’t do it. i kept telling myself that it’ll all be over soon. just point it my head, quick little pressing my of fingers and it be all over. i won’t feel it probably because it’ll happen too quickly for my brain to register the pain. told myself that in just a split second, i won’t have to feel pain again.i couldn’t do it. i felt like a fucking coward.edit: thanks for everyone’s kind words and support. it means a lot :)
31 and scared. no career, no friends and no girlfriend.
i haven't had a friend in almost 10 years. i used to have lots of friends and then everyone moved on with their lives.i'm quiet and have social anxiety and it never really got better. i thought my life would change but it never did.my parents are all i have.i've never had a job where i earnt more than minimum wage. i have a degree. it didn't make any difference.i joined a running group. i am always stood on my own and i feel very awkward and uncomfortable.i am no different now than i was at 16. i am forever stuck in the summer after high school. i am scared that this is it and i will live like this for the rest of my life. i am genuinely terrified that if my parents go i will be completely alone. i want to cry but i am too despressed. i never made the life progressions that everyone else makes and i am in a daze wondering how and where it all went wrong. it feels like yesterday that i was in my teens.
fucking sick of this bullshit
fucking sick of waking up every fucking day to drag my ass to somewhere i don't even want to be just so i can come home, get high and play videogames. i'm fucking sick of pretending that life is some grand adventure that should be cherished. fuck this shit i'm gonna eat fried chicken every fucking day till i have a heart attack
do weekends suck for anyone else?
spent most of today laying on my bed staring at the ceiling listening to music and watching youtube videos on my phone. loneliness is so boring.
i had my first kiss today
i know, im really late on having my first kiss. today i finally kissed my crush, and it felt wonderful. for a moment, all of my problems were lifted off my shoulders and i felt like someone actually cared about me. i just thought i would share this with you guys, because for me right now in my life, its about all i have.edit: wow everyone, thanks for all the kind responses, i never thought this post would really get any feedback, and it now has 556 up votes on the front page. i really appreciate everyones support, and i hope each and every one of you has a wonderful day. stay strong! - colourgreen3
a year ago today i nearly killed myself. the next day i bought a sketchbook. here is an album with drawings and doodles from a year's worth of recovering and coping.
hello everyone. as the title says, a year ago on june 20th i hit my lowest point. i had close calls before, but this one was worse. i was going to throw myself in front of a train. after that incident i decided to get my act together. i started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. in addition, i started to draw again. some of the stuff in this album i have submitted to here or r/anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. this is the first time i'm submitting almost everything i've done up til now, so i hope you guys like it and this helps you cope. please tell me if this is harmful and i will take it down immediately.edit: i am making this edit pretty late--it's march 11th as i write this. if anyone is still looking at this or happens to stumble on this post, i have decided to make a website to host my artwork. i cannot thank you all enough for your support. http://www.aninternalsoliloquy.com/
i finally got a job
now i can save so i can get myself out of this shitty place i'm in rn. wish me luck
do you ever just sleep bc you don't want to be awake?
i always try to make room for at least an hour and a half or so nap every day in my schedule and today i came across an unexpected few hours of free time and tried to sleep but i wasn't tired and realized just how often i sleep to avoid the pain that comes with being awake. wanting to sleep but not being physically tired enough to do so is a whole new kind of torture i wasnt prepared for. i just want to sleep, i dont want to deal with the pain i wish i could just have some peace and quite and curl up somewhere cozy and just fade away
does anyone else wish they could simply sleep forever?
it seems only in my dreams does the feelings of hopelessness and unhappiness goes away.
i’m really proud of myself! i’m back at work after 8 months off due to how bad my mental health has been.
i had a mental breakdown in january and my boss told me i either had to quit or keep working 50+ hour weeks. he could see i was in no state to be working. my family and friends also could see it. i quit and moved back home after my mother and friends were basically begging me to. they were all so worried and were afraid i would attempt suicide again. i’ve been seeing a psychologist once a week. taking my meds every single day. going to the shops and taking up hobbies so i can feel joy. all of it has been extremely emotionally draining but i have finally reached a much more stable place. so with the go ahead from my psychologist i started looking for part time work ( full time may be overwhelming so i’m easing back into it). i’ve been on a trial a few days last week at a cafe and really enjoyed it. being around people and having a purpose feels so amazing. i got the job yesterday and start in a weeks time doing 28 hours a week. i am so proud of how far i have come due to all the hard work i’ve put in and all the amazing support from my family, friends and my partner. i am so proud of my self and genuinely excited to be working again. (i wanted to share because i am so happy and want people to know).edit: this got a lot more attention than i expected!! i am so grateful for all the supportive messages and all the people who i have given hope to. i wish everyone the best of luck and am extremely grateful for all of you ❤️
does anybody else just feel like only laying in a couch/bed and just watch youtube?
i often just only sit or lay in my bed using my phone to watch videos or maybe play a game, since i have nothing better to do. i don't feel like doing any homework at all. sometimes i might get my ass up and use my computer. does anybody else experience something similar to this?
who here stays awake late at night because you are trying to avoid the next day of bullshit at work/school.
i know i do :/ 
whatever you do, please don't ignore me.
you can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. but please, please don't ignore me. i want my existence to be acknowledged. i want to be sure that i'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing i'm there, like i'm an outsider looking in. please don't make me feel any more isolated than i already do, like i have no friends who genuinely care about me. i know i suck, and i know i fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. i deserve it. but whatever you do, i'm begging you, *please* don't act like i'm not there at all.
i wish there was a way to restart my life, instead of permanently stopping it.

i want to kill myself but can't because i need to play fallout 4.
you might think this is a joke. it isn't. i've wanted to kill myself for a long while now, probably since around 12 years old. the only thing that alleviated my depression when i was younger was fallout 3. it was the best game i'd ever played. i swore to myself when i got bored of fo3 (two years after it came out) that i wouldn't kill myself until fallout 4 was released. i didn't count new vegas, because, well, it sucked. now that 4 is coming out, i don't know what to do with myself. i still want to die, but i can't just keep pushing it off until the next fallout release. i'm addicted to the series, yes, but i'd like to have some motivation to live other than a video game. i feel so pathetic. i've attempted suicide twice before and been admitted to a ward for two weeks once, which only made things worse. what else is there to live for? people generally bore or upset me. i have a girlfriend, friends, family, pets, a job, everything i could really ask for. i'm not allowed to get medication as i'm still under my parents insurance. i'm working on going back to therapy, but my parent's think my depression is just in my head.  i'd really love some advice, or just someone to talk about random shit online with. i hope people don't see this as some kind of joke. just writing this has helped, to some degree. thanks.edit: fallout was released last night at midnight. i'm feeling pretty good about it so far, but it better have some damn good replayability cuz fallout 5 is probably quite a ways off... i'm honestly surprised to see how much attention this got. its really pretty cool that other people can empathize with me. thanks all.
everyone click on this and sigh with me
*big sigh*
my depression and anxiety keeps me from saying anything
people don’t understand, sometimes i want to say stuff about how i’m feeling or talk about my depression or anxiety, but i just don’t. i just think if i tell my friends or anyone anything they won’t understand and think i just want attention. sometimes i literally type whole posts on here and don’t post them because i feel like people won’t care. i don’t know why i do this to myself but i can’t help it. i just hate myself for doing this to myself.
i hate when my boyfriend says, but don't i make you happy? that's not how depression works, love :(
then i have to be the big bitch, instead i just ignore it, which could possibly be worse. i don't know how to explain it, but no, you don't make me happy because i'm too depressed.
does anyone else retreat into their own self made fantasy's?
lately i have to keep my mind occupied on something, or else i feel like breaking down, like a damn that's about to burst. i keep fantasizing about a fictional version of me that isn't so broken. someone who has made something of themselves. i've been watching hours of youtube and inserting my self into those videos and it's just making me more depressed. someone who is normal and does normal people things. i feel like someone on the outside looking in. i still find it easier to just day dream than feel anything real in my actual life. else i just feeling like killing my self. 
people mistaking your lack of motivation for laziness
i feel stuck in my current situation, even thinking about it stresses me out. when i explain it to people, they say it sounds like excuses, me being lazy, me feeling entitled... every day i want to go out and do something about it. i don’t want to feel like a leech on society and absolutely hate feeling that way, but i just feel like i’m damaged beyond repair. i barely interact with people. i barely leave my apartment. i feel like i’m incapable of functioning properly in society, no matter how good my facade of being a “normal person” is.
it’s 3am
this again. i have to be up in 3 hours. i can never sleep because my mind never stops racing and it’s awful. all the reasons to hate this life, all the reasons to hate myself, all the things i could do to myself. funny how little does everyone know that i hate myself more than anyone could imagine, i constantly wish i could hurt myself as punishment for being the sore loser that i am, and wish i could be dead because i feel so worthless in this world that it would be easier than trying to fit in.i hate depression.
depression has turned me into a mean person.
this past year has been so scary because i’m noticing that my sadness and lethargy is turning into uncontrollable rage. everything sets me off and i lash out at people who are only trying to help me. ex: yesterday i was cooking, and my mom asked me if i washed the vegetables. instead of replying like normal and saying “yes”, i started yelling at her for over 30 mins and acted like an asshole to someone who was only checking on me. same thing happens when i misplace something or have to repeat myself. someone next to me parked bad? let me yell/rant about it and exhaust myself and everyone around me.immediately after, i feel like absolute scum and want to cut/drink/do drugs/kill myself because i’m making life unbearable for everyone around me. i know how awful i am to be around and it makes me hate myself more than i already do.for background, i’ve been living at home for the last 8 months after having a massive depressive episode my last semester of college. i want to go back in the fall but i feel like a massive embarrassment as a 23-yr old “super senior” and as someone who was always good at everything. i’ve always been known as “nice girl”, smiley and compliant. but now i get so fucking irritated to the point where every nerve in my body is on edge and my stomach is twisted. like panic attacks but anger. i’ve never been physically violent in my life but sometimes i get this uncontrollable urge to cause damage. i feel so out of control and like a crazy person because my moods come so suddenly and i can only ride it out. it’s like i’ve become a different person. i’ve been replaced by a different person who’s cold, twisted and bitter. and what gets me is that there are parts of me that crave the anger and volatility. 
you ever feel like your entire existence is wasted potential and you never became the person you were supposed to be?
i can't help feeling this way all the time. i look at the people around me and they've accomplished so much and done so much more than me. when i look at myself i see nothing special or interesting and it hurts more because i feel like i was supposed to be more, but i'm just nothing.
one of the most frustrating things about depression is how much of an idiot you become the longer you're depressed
i feel like my brain has just rotted into swiss cheese. i used to have an incredible memory and now i can't remember what i did this morning (although doing nothing every day helps in this regard). i can't remember teachers names from high school or college without putting serious effort into it and even then i can't remember all of them. seeing something about derivatives (math) and realizing that i took and passed calc 1 in college with a b but i literally can't remember what derivatives actually mean much less how to solve them is depressing in itself. it's like whatever work i managed to do 5-10 years ago is meaningless. it also makes the thought of going back to school impossible. i'd give anything to be average and to not constantly walk around forgetting what i'm doing or what i wanted to say. 
people mourn you if you kill yourself and ask what they could've done to prevent it, yet they treat you like a pariah if you attempted to kill yourself and failed.
sometimes i feel like people would appreciate my existence more if i were dead. why is that?
depression has turned me into a fucking idiot.
my attention span is shockingly short, i forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. the worst thing has to be the memory problems. i forget shit all the time. what chores i'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not i took my meds this morning. i also have a lot of trouble focusing. i can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. even driving has proven dangerous a few times. sometimes i doubt whether or not i should be out on the road. i can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.people close to me think that i'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but i'm actually trying my best. but they won't hear any of it. they always see if you wanted to, you would and while i guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that i forget shit all the time.on top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things i *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things i have to get through before anything gets done. i have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. then i have to remember what to do. then i have to have the energy to do it. then i have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.i feel like i have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.
sleeping is nice because you're not actually dead and you're not awake so it's a win-win situation
i saw this [here](http://i.imgur.com/ueolwhv.png) and thought, fuck, this is my life. every night i wish i could sleep and sleep and sleep.
sleep is the best part of the day
i don't know if it's just me but the best bit is sleeping. it's not part of laziness, it's the fact that you don't get to live the world during that timeyou don't get the stress of this world but just doing nothing. even if it's lying in bed it's enough.when you sleep you aren't comparing how miserable your life is to anyone else and nothing could matter at that minute
i'm depressed because i'm lonely. and i'm lonely because i'm depressed.
it's catch-22. fuck this shit.edit: does anyone want to talk? maybe we can be a bit less lonely together.
depression has changed my memory-- has anyone else experienced this?
i know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but i feel like depression changes my memory in a way that i never hear anyone else talk about. after a depressive episode, i feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and i have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. even after i have fully recovered from the episode.my last episode was during last fall, and even though i got better in the spring, i still feel like i have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. it just feels like everything is so different now, like i moved to a different town, but i didn't.i don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. i am really curious if this happens to other people.edit: wow. i did not expect so many replies. i know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after i'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. and i have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and i can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that i'm not just stupid or flakey. but hearing that this happens to so many other people too... i don't know. it sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like i am really not alone in this. i know there are other people out there who understand. thank you for your comments :)
does anyone feel like they aren't good enough to date someone?
like your life is too boring? like the fact that you have no friends and no prior relationship experience and nothing exciting about your life makes you not good enough? there was a guy i was interested in but i've decided its not worth it because a) i'm sure he's not interested in me and b) he has great people around him, does great things and really lives life, while i'm this shitty pile of nothingness.
a guard on world of warcraft told me, may your blades never dull, and it was the nicest thing anyone said to me today.
fuck.
i’m a deeply depressed mental health professional. does that make me a hypocrite?
i am a mental health counselor and student pursuing a masters degree in social work to become a therapist.i spend all day helping those who are depressed, suicidal, self-harming, anxious, but i can’t seem to apply any of the coping skills to myself.i’m so depressed. i cry all the time over the smallest things. i daydream of relapsing back into cutting, even though i’m 3.5 years clean. i’m so anxious all the time. i want to die but i’m not actively trying to kill myself. one of the reasons why i haven’t killed myself yet is because i am scared that it will influence some of my clients to follow in my footsteps. but aside from that, i don’t have much interest in staying alive.am i a hypocrite for wanting to help others but not being able to help myself?
the only reason i wont kill myself is because i don't want to make my mom cry.
i want to die and i fantasize about killing myself everyday. the only reason i wont do it is because i do not want to hurt anyone. i am just here, rotting away.
nobody thinks depression is serious until suicide happens
i've been on medical leave from work to seek treatment. few know where i am. those who know have been telling those who ask some variation of she's fine, just taking care of what she needs to. three people know...all three have told that they've just been relaying that i'm fine.the other day, my supervisor and i talked about sending the office an email about how i'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return datefine. my apt. is a dumpster. i don't have real relationships. all i do is eat and throw up at 31. never once have i uttered those words fine, but others are saying it for me. i don't even know what i'm hoping for or want...but i feel like my illness is all made up in my head. if i had cancer, nobody would say i was fine. i get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is less than a physical illness.  i'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. i'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. i'm not fine. i don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but i have to. because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. back when i asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something serious so that people wouldn't worry.
you guys prevented me from committing suicide yesterday. thank you.
you guys are so kind and supportive of a complete stranger. i felt a strange comfort seeing your kind messages when i asked this subreddit to help me kill myself with painless suicide methods. thank you. i havent felt that warm comforting feeling in a while. i cried.
yesterday a random girl on campus hugged me and i felt much better
i go to one of the largest universities in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life. yesterday, i was killing time in between classes as usual, sitting near some trees in a popular part of campus to study at. on a scale from 0-10, my depression was at an 8 or 9 and i desperately needed help. i posted on yik yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug (yik yak is a popular app among college students kind of like an anonymous twitter, and you can only see posts within a mile away from you or something like that). i ended up deleting the post almost instantly because i felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug. but within a minute, a random girl peeked at my phone, asked if i was the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while i choked back tears. i still can't believe it happened. i didn't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day. 
is anyone else thinking of killing themselves after their parents die?
they're the only ones who would lose the will to live if i died. 
i know what i have to do to get better; however, i don’t have the motivation nor concentration to do it
anybody in the same boat?:(
i'm just tired, has become my catchphrase, and a pretty huge lie, at this point.
the people i work with are quite bubbly, talkative, and sociable, but there are a lot of times i just don't have it in me to try to socialize. my job locks me in a room with 1-2 other people for 12 hours+, so talking and playing games is the only way to pass the time. when i'm not actively talking or contributing to the conversation and they ask me what's wrong, my response is always sorry, i'm just tired, when i mean sorry, i feel like a useless piece of shit today, you'll have to excuse me. do i want to socialize with my co-workers? of course. does my mood/brain want me to socialize? hell no, it wants me to brood in the corner and overthink. i even do this in my personal relationships. when i'm in a bad mood (which is about 99% of the time anymore) and i shuffle around the house not really talking to anyone, and my mom or step-dad ask if i'm okay, my response is always i'm just tired, then i'll go to my room, shut my door, and only come out for basic necessities for the rest of the day. i haven't talked to my friends in god knows how long because i'm just not mentally prepared to most days. i'm scared i'll lose them eventually. my phone is never moved from where its set down when i came home from work because no one is concerned enough to talk to me unless they need something. 
who else lives their life in a fantasy world?
i spend probably 90% of my days daydreaming. sitting in class, watching tv, playing video games etc i'm always daydreamingi go to this fantasy world where i actually have a passion and i actually have support and friends where i'm the best at something. some cultural icon.it's unhealthy and it's caused me to stop myself from ever being happy in life. how could i ever be happy when all i think about is what if i was someone else? some amazing artist? musician? and not just this talentless loser who will spend the majority of his life grinding a 9-5 and the most exciting thing i do is play video games on the weekends?and then i get the whole bullshit about well instead of daydreaming about it, go start finding your passion and get good at iti'm hoping you guys know that that is just bullshit. it hurts me every time. i'm tired of hearing it.learning how to accept being a nobody sucks. idk if i will ever fully accept it.
do you guys ever feel ashamed for having depression?
sometimes i think about my current situation i'm in and i think:  i have no reason to be depressed and sometimes i see others with depression who have a good reason to be depressed but sometimes i feel ashamed to think i have depression when i think of other people's misfortune despite my own misfortune.i even avoid saying i'm depressed and just say i'm sad now because i feel like i'm insulting those who are depressed.
my mom asks don't you get tired sitting around everyday doing nothing? i do. i want to do something, but i just can't be bothered.
there's just nothing interesting.
the scariest part is when depression becomes so normal you forget what happiness really felt like
when i was 16 it was so strange to me. i have a journal entry where i wrote, this isn't who i'm supposed to be. everybody noticed me go from goofy a-student to constantly skipping classes and looking so empty and sad.i tried to fight it. i really did. but fast-forward 11 years and the 16-year-old me is gone. the intelligence is there, just not applied towards anything useful or productive. the humor is there sometimes, just more morbid and mostly kept to myself. i am constantly fatigued, unfocused, sad, irritable, pessimistic, and anxious. the most common coping mechanisms i have that give me comfort are food and tv/games. oh but i'm not really like this—it's my depression! that's what i said for a fucking decade and i can't even believe it anymore.my depression is who i am now most of the time, and it's been that way for years. it's become my personality. it's become so normal i don't remember that people aren't supposed to feel and act like this. it's not fucking normal to take a few hours to get out of bed, not shower for days, and do nothing but binge eat, watch tv, play games, and sleep for days and even weeks on end. i can't stand it anymore.i just took a wellbutrin again after giving up on it after a week last time. fuck it, can't get any worse. i have to tell myself that i have a serious problem and the only way is to get help. because if i don't then i'm back in that damn pit again, feeling miserable yet powerless to ever change it. 
anyone else constantly check their phone even though you never receive anything?
i woke up with 30 reddit notifications, thank you all for making me feel valued.
brilliant mind?

i did it! i’m sixteen!!!
a year ago i was convinced i would never make it  this far. well fuck you depression, i did it.
does anyone else feel guilty about being depressed?
i just feel guilty about being sad all the time. like i have a decent life, no financial trouble, or family deaths, so i feel like i don’t deserve to be depressed. i always think about how much worse other people have it in life, and it makes me think i’m just spoiled and unappreciative.
the only messages i receive is from automated apps.
:(
i just showered. tomorrow i start a new job. feeling hopeful.
reddit,a year and a half ago i was bullied at work and forced to quit. i've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). i have nightmares still about my past work place. i truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. my depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because i was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. i soon spiraled into a mess. i financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. many days i stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. i currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. i do take them now though, that's something i usually haven't done.but a couple months ago i updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. from that interview to now, yeah, i've still had a rough time. i haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. but i finally showered. i brushed my teeth this morning. i'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. i'm going to work. my new manager seems like a great person. i'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. plus i'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced gi procedures.all of my previous posts here have been eaten by the auto mod i think, but thank you to anyone who reads my story.edit: wow, thank you so much for everyone's support. here's a little something about my first day:these new co-workers, i already can tell they talk bad about others but basically to warn me about a chatty cathy, and from two individually they mentioned that the it guys walking around (doing yearly maintenance it looked like) were nerds through and through...but i can't help but chuckle at that. the guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. i didn't participate in that conversation but i suppose i am now. i assisted during one procedure today. and it went well. my preceptor has twenty years of experience in gi and i can tell she's not aware of some best practices, but she's a wonderful lady with 4 grandkids and high energy. i can appreciate that she knows what she's doing. and has the answers to my simple questions. i'll actually be working at 3 different locations for this hospital system, but i'll get comfortable with hospital #1 before i move to #2 then #3.i also was given a few checklists to complete. one was computer education, which i completed entirely. long story short, i had a great first day!!
i did it guys.
i talked to a girl and actually got her number. as someone with sever anxiety and depression i finally did it. she even called me cute and complimented me on my hair. for the first time in a long time i feel something.
i want to sleep so i don't have to be awake yet also sad because it'll make tomorrow arrive sooner
i want to be asleep so i don't have to feel the crushing emptiness, to escape the painful loneliness and to have some relief from feeling lost. i'll snuggle up with my teddy bears as best as i can and try and sleep.... though what's the point if it makes tomorrow arrive sooner? tomorrow... another day of feeling like this. another day of feeling like this. then another and another.edit: thank you so much for all your responses and insight, i appreciate it.
plenty of people have told me i'm here if you need to talk yet i'm sitting here and i can't think of anybody i'd be comfortable taking to at the moment.
that includes random online people.  not fishing for attention. 
i feel like a background character in everybody else’s life
i never go anywhere, always look the same, don’t do anything interesting or have any goals. it’s been this way for as long as i can remember and i know it won’t change. 
i understand now what my neighbor said to me years back
he's 5 years older than me, i remember it was like summer of 2013 and i just started dodging social events, i remember one day binging season 6 of how i met your mother while all of my friends(back when i had any) were outside playing football and messing around the entire day,i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of talks on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this: *you can't possibly understand now, but you will see it in couple of years if you become like me, how stupid you'll feel waking up one day to realize how everyone around you has left, moved on and you are still in the same spot you were years ago... if you sit in your room and jerk off on computer all day long nothing will happen to you, ever, but it takes you years to truly realize that*i always found it funny how he's giving me advices and shit but he is fucked up himself, it's ironic how i'm exactly like him right now, soon to be 23, unemployed for 8 months, exhausted from social anxiety and depression, i spend most of the time inside on pc, watching my friends on social media being happy and having such normal lives, big majority of ppl i know has left for jobs or college
feeling like i'm faking depression
i don't know about you guys, but i constantly feel like i'm just a lazy piece of shit, and not somebody with depression.doesn't matter how many suicidal thoughts i have... nah, just a lazy shitbag who doesn't give a fuck about their degree and spends hours a day on league of legends. that's me. it's great. especially when it's backed up by your parents complaining that you don't actually study. 
does anyone just want to move away and never look back? just disappear from your current existing life
and start over, fresh? i feel like i have the bigger desire to change my number, move to another side of the world and just live my life there.  i feel like i’m so done with my life and where it is. 
for anyone going through a break up, here's a quote from south park (of all places) that helped me a lot.

my bf is cleaning his car and it's a big deal to me.
as the title shows i know this won't be important to others but my bf has been suffering from severe depression after dealing with a loss and he is in the car detailing business. he has let his car go to where there was dirt and trash and piles upon piles of things in his back seats. i have only ever mentioned the state of his car once to him but i knew ultimately it would be up to him to clean it (i know i could have but when it comes to him and his car, he is the only one to do stuff to it. he just lets me drive it when i want). well today is the day and even though it's something small he has been making all these steps to better himself and i support him every day as much i possibly can. i just had to tell someone :)&#x200b;edit/update: i just want to thank everyone who commented i honestly thought that only like 8 people might even like this or upvote it. i want to let you all know he had a good day and that we are doing great. i personally have suffered from depression (diagnosed at 13) for a large portion of my life and i honestly think thats what has been so great that when he has bad days/weeks and shows all the symptoms i have learned when he needs me to just be beside him and when to give him space and remind him of my constant support and love. it's not easy but it has been the easiest thing for me to love him the way i do. i hope you all find the joy in the little things and wish you all the best!
anyone else get annoyed by relatives who think that finding religion will help your depression?
i’m not sure how to go into any more detail than what the title says but it seems that religious folks and most not only born agains believe that finding jesus will make every single life problem go away. it doesn’t and yet they still keep insisting that it will.
i am so lonely
does anyone ever have that feeling of i want to go home but home isn't your old house or your family or a time in your life before . it's a feeling that you miss but you don't actually have anymore. 
i made my bed
guys i know this might be stupid.  but i finally was able to make my bed. like i mean having sheets on it and stuff. i know otherwise it's gross. this is really big for me. i final didn't feel like it was useless to do. sorry. i'm gross. but i'm actually proud. (wish it didn't happen at 3:30 am because i can't sleep but oh well i got a burst of energy so i did it.) i'm feeling tired now but i hope this boost will stay tomorrow to clean other things.  sorry if this sounds stupid.
tfw you cannot function and have an intense fear of failure so you skip all your classes and spend your days in bed hoping for some kind of miracle
i want to die.
you know you're depressed when...
* you sleep 4 hours some nights and 16 hours others. * the grocery store is right across the street but you just can't get over there to buy food. * you need a dedicated blanket for your couch for those times when you just can't get up. * you run out of clothes to wear because you just can't make yourself do the laundry. * dirty dishes pile up in the sink even when you do manage to run the dishwasher, because ypu can't manage to unload it. * you come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything. * if you're unemployed like me, same, but as soon as you wake up. * sometimes you do make it out of bed, and onto the floor. the door is just too far away. * you buy books, games, etc. and they sit on your shelf because you don't have the energy to read them. * you regularly go days without leaving your apartment. * you get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted. * you think of things you normally like to do, and just don't care to actually do them. when you do, you just get bored and don't get any enjoyment from it. * you hear the phone ring and just can't be bothered to get up and answer it. * you try as hard as you can to think positively, but everything just feels dull and grey. * when you do well you just feel apathetic and that you only did what was expected of you. * your goal in life is to minimize suffering instead of maximizing enjoyment. * you'd be okay if one day you fell asleep and just didn't wake up, even if you don't actually want to kill yourself. * everything in life just feels like a burden. even eating. * you can't remember a time in life where you truly felt happy. moments of pleasure are scarce and fleeting. * you don't take vacation days because there's nowhere you want to go. * you hate being around happy people because it just reminds you of how bad you feel. * you take antidepressants and see a therapist and it doesn't really help. 
does anyone else feel like you want people to care but when they do, you feel embarrassed and try to act like everything's okay?
i don't know why i do this. i don't like appearing vulnerable i guess? or maybe because my mind's so messed up they wouldn't be able to help me anyway and it's daunting to explain everything.
depression in its simplest form.

does anyone else feel “casually suicidal”?
i’ve been dealing with depression for almost 8 years now. i’ve had good times, sometimes they’ll last as long as a year, but it always comes back.i’ve reached a point where i know i’m too much of a coward to just kill myself. and i feel like if i did people would just say even more terrible things about me when i can’t defend myself...so i call myself “casually suicidal”... i can’t bring myself to actually slide that razor... but if i just so happen to die in a freak accident... if i “forget” to look both ways... if i happen to end up in a dangerous situation... oh well... just does the work for me.i fall asleep at night just thinking “i want to die i hope i die” in the hopes that if i think t hard enough maybe my heart will just stop while i’m sleeping and no one will be the wiser.does anyone else feel like this?
it makes me fucking angry
it has stolen our lives. all of the experiences you are meant to have - an innocent teenage relationship, making friends in college/highschool, marriage, having children, having fun in your early years. most of us here have been robbed of some of these things and we will never have the chance to experience it again.people are having fun my age, partying, socialising, having fun without overthinking it. whereas i am stuck in my room, starving myself because i am too tired and too anxious to leave my room. people are working hard to get an incredible degree and have a great uni experience whereas i am stuck staring at the wall, too tired and unmotivated to do anything, becoming a husk of my former self.it really hit me today. these moments have been stolen from us forever, swallowed by the gaping pit of depression. and no one will care.
when i say 'i'm tired'..
i don't just mean because i haven't slept, although sometimes that is the case. what i really mean is i'm tired of fighting. i'm tired of feeling worthless and useless. i'm tired of trying so fucking hard and it still not being enough. i'm tired of getting up again. i'm tired of lying. i'm tired of people taking advantage. i'm tired of people not understanding. i'm tired of the pain. i'm tired of surviving. i'm tired of existing. i'm so goddamn tired
does anyone else have unprovoked, casual suicidal thoughts?
i'm posting this here because i don't really know where else to put it. i noticed the sidebar link to suicidewatch, but it didn't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help. since i was a teenager i've had casual suicidal thoughts. i don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when i say that, i literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go i made a small mistake at work today, i should just drive into that concrete barrier or i'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching tv or something, and think you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head. i don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. and what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like yeah, i guess that /is/ an option!this has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently i've been thinking about how fucked up it is. and i feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode. i just had to get this off my chest. it's difficult to have these cavalier thoughts and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/imposter syndrome to seem normal every day. 
does anyone else feel like they don't exist in anyone elses mind unless you're standing right in front of them?
i can't imagine anyone even thinking of me, even for a brief second, when i'm not in the room. all my life i've been forgotten and invisible. no wonder i'm so depressed.
i can't kill myself because i'll cause grief to others. atleast this way i'm the only one who's suffering.

so it's a sunday morning and i'm going to go to a coffee shop on my own
for no particular reason. just as a baby step, going outside, enjoying myself **for myself**. i've forgotten how to do this. let's re-try for hundredth time.
i hate when people say if you're having depressed/suicidal thoughts, reach out and talk to someone!
ok, done. they said the same old platitudes that everyone has heard a million times. it gets better take it day by day lots of people care about you etc. so now that they know an embarrassing and vulnerable fact about me, what have i gained? do i feel better? are they going to have any insight or advice that i haven't already learned? ha, no. at best they have sympathy for me (which i don't want), and at worst they will be uncomfortable and not want to interact with me anymore (this happened with 3 different friends before i finally learned my lesson).i mean, perhaps that helps for people with very mild or temporary depression. and that's fine and all, but it's pretty discouraging when the advice literally begins and ends with talk to someone. if you say yeah so i tried that... they'll just throw their hands up and tell you to use drugs. or just say hang in there! hang in there, huh? just a few more decades and you'll die naturally :) hang in there, every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain, but do it anyway :) depression causes you to be a worthless failure because you don't have the motivation to further your career or social life, but hang in there as a complete loser!then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone' is a 'therapist.' talk to a therapist and get help. ok, let me just pull money out of my ass, and pay hundreds of dollars for someone who probably won't be able to do shit for me anyway. but that's another story...
does anyone else not remember the majority of their childhood?
for me i had a pretty traumatic childhood. i don’t remember most of it except for some of the really bad things. it feels like my brain just blocked everything to protect me or something.
does anyone else procrastinate to a ridiculous degree?
so i procrastinate far *far* too much. absolutely nothing motivates me to do work any more. nothing at all. back in high school i was a pretty good student. i got all my work done on time, literally never missed an assignment etc. but in college, i just can't bring myself to do anything. i have a huge project that needs to be completed and the idea was that we'd do a few weeks of work in class and the rest at home. ever since the class sessions ended, i haven't even looked at it. and it was due to be finished 2 weeks ago. i open the file, look at it for a couple of minutes and then put it away. in part, it is because i find it incredibly difficult (and yes, i have asked for help but none of it made it any easier for me) but it's also because i've pretty much just fallen into a pit of inescapable procrastination. i wake up way too late, stay in bed for at least an hour after waking up, sit around playing video games, glance at my work, play more video games and then go back to bed. for god's sake, i even put off making this post for a week.is anyone else like this? it's slowly destroying my grades right now and the longer it goes on, the harder it's going to be to get out of this complete mess that my life is at the moment.
does anyone else feel like there getting stupider?
i have had anxiety and depression for a really long time and recently i've been thinking that i might have lost at least some of my mental capacity and i was just wondering if anyone felt the same or had anything to contribute to the thought.
my girlfriend took her own life today. i don't know how to handle this.
she texted me to say good bye while i was gone for a couple hours today. i was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. she was gone by the time i got back home. she had been fighting depression and i guess she lost. i called friends and family for support right after 911. they've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, i can't. the image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. that was my baby, my better half. falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. there's a huge hole in me and i don't know what to do or how to handle it. i just cry, i've been crying since 3pm. my face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. to anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? what gave you the will to want to go another day? or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what i'm feeling.thanks for the kind wishes everyone. the xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and i'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. can't take any more tonight.i was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. spent today with friends keeping me busy, i haven't cared about any of it. i've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. i know the sun shown today, but i didnt notice it. i've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. not sure why, i guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. i'm gonna quit driving for now. my school friend said our college has grief counseling. i will be going there in the morning. i knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but i'm just cold. cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. tonight will be rough again. everyone is sleeping again and i've taken my xanax so i apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. just wanted to give some back story. beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. she was the most compassionate person to me. she had tried this before before we met. we didn't find, never did. once when i did get upset with her, i caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. i'll finish this in the morminfit's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. i want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than i can express in text. today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. i got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. i'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but i think its important for me to write this down. and i apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. my gf wasn't from here, i never met or talked to any of her family. i didn't even know their names. she told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. so i never asked questions, i just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. she said they divorced when the children died, on oct 15. fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. that was 2 years ago.we started dating in no november of last year. she started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. the coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. i got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. i wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. the reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. well her mom was gone but not for what i was told. there was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. that was a few months before we met. she liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. i talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. all we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. there was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. id here her talking to herself, but now i'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. she would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. it's just so much to process. shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. she believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. this just makes things clearer and so much more sad.12/03/2012: i am doing much better everyone. i thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part. the only lingering effects is the last image of her, every time something remind me of her my mind goes straight to that. that happens quite a bit, but hopefully that will pass as the other pain has. to those that have messaged me saying how much this has helped them, it really means a lot to me. i am glad some good could have come from this at least. if anyone needs to talk, please feel free to message me.
do you guys ever have random short bursts of crying that only last for a few seconds.
it happens to me when i watch tv or listen to music. 
my wife killed herself last week.
about a week ago my wife left the apartment, bought a gun, drove somewhere secluded, pulled over and shot herself. i have been with her since 2007 when we were still in high school. we became adults together.i have always had mildish depression and anxiety, but she has always had major depression and suicidal ideation. it just kept getting worse and worse. she tried all sorts of medications, therapy (including dbt). she had a partial diagnosis for bpd as well.i'm not even exactly sure why i am posting here other than to vent a bit. i see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday. i am also on an ssri already, so i am taking the proper steps. i just am so beside myself. i always knew it would happen. she told me it would and that there was no way to change it. i lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself. i had to make so many excuses for her to my family throughout the years. i could always tell they disproved (even if only a little bit) of me putting so much effort into her. i think they better understand now.i do not mean to be dramatic, but i feel like, even though i do not regret being with her, it has tormented me in a deep, possibility irreversible way. i know she never meant to harm me and it was the depressed train of thinking she had, but only about a week before she killed herself, i finally got her to admit what i suspected for a long time. she was distancing herself from me for 8 months in order to soften the blow of her suicide. for 8 months at least, she was purposefully distant, did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me. i felt so alone. i hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead, because the pain of seeing her suffer was so unimaginably hard to bear.i feel so angry at her parents, especially her mom, for always putting her down. making her feel worthless. her mother is the literal worst person i know. she always acted as if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public, but in private she shit on everything she did. my wife was literally a genius at least according to the iq tests the doctors gave her when diagnosing her mental illnesses. she was an incredible artist who painted, drew, sewed, wood burned, and a shit ton of other things. anything art, she could do. and her parents hated that, because she did not want to join the navy like them or go into business. she wanted to teach and almost achieved her dreams before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work.i just wish could have been different for her. all she ever wanted to do was help people and make the world better. i just want to sit on my ass and play video games. why here and not me. i work in corrections and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves. why not them. she never hurt a god damn soul.edit: a name.edit 2: i just want everyone to know that i was hesitant about even posting anything about my situation, but i am glad that i did because it has been very therapeutic. i only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one's thoughts, feeling and beliefs. most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and i am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do. so thank you everyone.edit 3: thank you kind stranger for the gold. i think i know who is was, but i will just leave it at that.edit 4: just a few photos of my wife's art.
do you ever worry that you've been depressed for so long that you don't know how not to be depressed?
if that makes sense? even when i'm not feeling so down i still don't do anything like go out and see friends. it's almost as if being depressed has become an ingrained habit and i don't know how to break out of it. if i was magically cured of depression i'm not sure that anything would actually change because i'm so used to seeing no one and doing nothing. does anyone else feel like that? 
told my psychiatrist that i want to be dead
a while ago i told my psychiatrist that i want to be dead and that i’ve been having suicidal thoughts for a while and i’ll never get his reaction out of my head. he told me “why kill yourself now when you can still do it later”idk, it was the first time someone didn’t react badly when i told them about my thoughts and i can’t even disagree with him lmao
i’m so sick of being ugly
i hate being a girl with excessive body hair i just want to be normal. i fucking hate my life and i hate the way i look. fuck this.  no guy will ever like me or want to be with me. i’ll be alone. i don’t have hope for anything.edit: thank you all for the kind words and messages. i appreciate it so much. i feel really lonely a lot of the time but this really helped. i’m still struggling to get past the excessive body hair but at least i’m trying. again, thank you ❤️
sometimes i just wanna purposefully fail a suicide attempt
i don't want to make my family and parents sad, but i just want to make people understand what i've been going through, it feels like nobody cares until you actually kill or try to kill yourself..
my therapist was like fake it 'till you make it... i actually was pissed. what the fuck do you think i'm doing? i'm faking it every day. i pretend to care at work, with friends, at the grocery store, etc. i'm sick of having a fake smile on my face.
i've been trying to do things that interest me, and even that's not working. i 'want' to put a new fender on my car, bought it, removed the old one, and don't care enough to finish. i've been embarrassed driving the car as is, but can't care enough to just do it. i don't care about work, eating, exercising, watching a movie, doing something online, etc. i just don't care. and it sucks. my life is stagnant and i wish i could move forward... &#x200b;
the moment i wake up, i'm already looking forward to going back to bed that night.
wish i could just sleep for 16 hours a day and dream whatever the fuck i want to.
does anyone pretend to sleep to hide from being social?
it takes so much energy just to socialize and put on a fake smile.
i'm almost 24, and have completely wasted the past 5-6 years of my life. i'm in such a dark place and don't know what to do.
hi there, i'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in august. i have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. i have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and i'm completely devastated about it.if you'll excuse this, i'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. i just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. honestly, i can say i've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. all i did in my younger years was play video games. i didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, i didn't grow into a man. i stayed a child, and i am a child now. in high school, all i did was waste my potential and genuine ability so i could play games and not have to think about responsibility. my senior year i didn't even apply for a college. i graduated and went to a community college even though i didn't know why i was there. from that point, all i did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, i then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where i left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. once that depressive period related to my ex was over, i realized with shock that i had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. so what did i do? did i snap out of it and start climbing upward? no. i was so horrified, and i slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point. the good news is that after three semesters of just laying around (not even using the time off to do something adventurous or awesome), i started back into school this spring, and though my gpa is shit from my earlier failings, i will almost surely finish with a's in both my two classes this semester. i still have no idea what i want to do long-term, but i'm ok with that. what i'm realizing now is sort of an exponentially increased version of what i realized after my first rut. i now realize that not only have i done nothing with my recent time, but i've done nothing during the entire 18-23 period of my life but wallow, and i will never be able to do it over. i'm almost 24, and i'm starting to feel my perception of time speed up. this is quite honestly making me panic severely. i feel like i'm going to blink and be 40, then blink again and be 70. i don't really know what to say. i feel so up against it. i could have spent the last 5 years actually finding myself, or traveling, backpacking, adventuring. at the very least i could have been responsible and had my b.s by now, and now i could be adventurous for a period before getting a job or going to grad school.but now i won't finish my degree until i'm 26 or 27, and i could be 33 before i'm done if i want to pursue further education. i see people who are 18, 19, 20 and going on adventures, taking advantage of that time. people i know. and it makes me sob inside. i feel that there is some neoteny going on here. the thought of the magic of childhood ending has always been too much for me to think about. i feel that these years are a result of this. i was terrified to grow up. now i'm at the age where i'm on the roller coaster of adult time with or without my permission, and i wasted those precious, fun transition years.i wish i had done something responsible in the past 6 years. i wish  i had worked hard, maybe learned a trade in my teens so i could have moved out, felt secure, and pursued a fulfilling career with my feet under me. i can't bear the weight of the situation i've put myself into. i can't even think about it straight enough to organize this post. the only responsible thing i've done is pay off 2k in debt last year. that's it.my parents look at me with this look in their eyes. like they're thinking, what is he doing with his life?, that they can sense the personal hell i've boxed myself up in. the reality of this is so damn final. every time i watch a movie, i have this sort of sorrowful pang in my heart as i watch the heroism of the characters. spiderman made me long to be 18 and start my youthful adult adventure, but do it right this time. even about my childhood, i feel the same way. if i see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a self-sufficient man, it makes me desperately wish i had spent my youth building skills, or learning self-sufficiency instead of gaming and ... gaming.i just don't know what to do. my heart begs to have another chance, and i of course know that's an impossibility, so i feel paralyzed by finality. this part about my time perception speeding me up is what really  started this boiling point. i'm cracking under the weight of it. i want to grow into being a man, learn skills, become secure and self-sufficient, go on adventures, have a period of joyful expression and free adventure before i have to walk into the monotony of adulthood. but now, even if i do these things, i'll push my degree off even further, or my bank account even lower, and i'll be in my 30's before i even get to where most people are at my current age. i don't know what to do. i don't know what i should do. i don't even really know what i want to do. i don't want to be 24. i don't want to have this weight on me. i want to take this darkness and use it to make me stronger, wiser, more experienced, self-sufficient, mature in the truest sense of the word. i want to experience a full 50-60-70 more years, not a cheapened, sped up version that only feels 20 youthful years. i just want to conquer this, and finally experience fulfillment, adventure and joy.
i was severely depressed during my teen years and at some point i was happy. during that time i would think back and i couldn't believe or understand how i was ever that depressed. now that i'm depressed again, i don't believe or understand how i was ever happy.

i bet al lot of you are like this aswell as me. 

i swear. every time i feel positive and im talking happily and feel okay, someone says something or replies to me in a way that takes my smile away immediately.
out of the very few times i have the energy to speak and suggest positive happy things, shut down. i feel my body's emotion literally shift. i get lethargic, my smile immediately fades and i don't speak the rest of the day. the out of my stomach drops and my chest begins to form that empty feeling.it sucks. i hate this feeling, what's the point in being positive or telling me to be if you're the one that won't even acknowledge me while im speaking as well or reply rude or curt or short when i thought we were having a good time and im just talking about stuff i like or want to do.it hurts.
when the little voice says i want to die
i force myself to replace it with i want to try. i don't know if it's working, but i'm still here.
anyone feel depressed because they just don't care about life anymore? that to do anything at all is exhausting mentally and physically
i have lost the drive to get through life and care about what happens to me and that makes me depressed.  i have been medicated and see a therapist but nothing is working. i also have friends and family that care deeply for me.  but that almost makes it worse, they're caring for someone whose ability to care about anything is broken. its as if i am a black hole and their caring is matter that just disappears when it reaches me. there isn't really anything i enjoy and just existing is overwhelming.  and i am no longer young anymore (i am 34) so it feels like time is running out.  what is the point of living if i see no point in it?  i am alive because killing myself would devistate my mom and others that care about me, but is that really worth it? existing just to please others while feeling no pleasure and mostly pain?  
anyone else fantasize about the freedom of suicide but would never actually go through with it?
the idea of never having to worry again/being free from any expectations is really appealing, but i don’t think the positives of suicide will ever outweigh the negatives for me. but i imagine killing myself a lot. anyone else feel this way?
being depressed is bad. feeling guilty about being depressed is the fucking worst.
anyone else feel like it's not even the anxiety, isolation, lack of interest etc. that feels the worst, it's the sense that nothing sufficiently bad has happened to you to make you feel like you *earned* being depressed? i remember at one of my lowest points a few years ago not wanting to call the hotline because i thought they would tell me it was reserved for people with *real* problems, of which i had none. i just feel absolutely awful wasting away all of the time, energy, and money my family poured into me over the years when i feel depressed when i can't point to anything specific that's causing it. makes me feel weak, like i should just be able to snap out of it, and when i don't, the guilt multiplies how bad i feel.
i decided to come out of the closet about suicidal depression on facebook when robin williams died. it went better than i thought it would. my friends were extremely supportive. this is what i posted.
hey, friends! today i want to talk about suicidal depression. every time there's a big suicide in the news, i see a lot of conversation that makes me concerned. it seems like depression is a problem that lots of people don't understand very well. i'm sorry this is so long, but it's an issue that's very close to me. i see people say things like it was the coward's way out or he threw it all away over nothing. you should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it. it's an illness. your brain isn't working properly, the same way a broken limb doesn't work properly. instead of being unable to walk, you're unable to process positive feelings. you're constantly in a state of sadness, or anger, or fear, or self-loathing. this is a lifelong condition for many people. you can develop coping strategies, but there's no real cure or universal answer. if that imagery is not helpful, it's like having goblins in your brain. it's like fighting an enemy every single day that you can't see who makes it impossible for you to be happy. it doesn't matter that you have all these nice things and people who love you, because you physically can't enjoy them or anything else. that's a really hard way to live. it hurts me when i hear people with depression described as weak. they have to be strong and brave everyday, just to leave their house or have social interactions. these are people fighting a war that makes it difficult or painful to do very basic things. it is tragic when someone dies fighting that battle, but it is not shameful. the second thing i want to talk about is dismissive solutions. i love that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable. however, it seems like some people think the conversation ends at get help. if only he had gotten help! why didn't he get help? why didn't he dial h-e-l-p on the phone so the helpers in the help van could take him to the helpatorium? it is absolutely important to tell people get help. it is sometimes a little patronizing when it's coming from people who don't understand how hard that is. i've seen this taken to a very nasty place, where people say things like it's his fault for not getting help. why should i have sympathy? if you're struggling with depression, i want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessities. if you've never struggled with depression, i want to stress that seeking help can be much harder than you think it is. i have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life. i called the suicide hotline back when i was delivering pizzas. it is not a magical fix-everything service. they told me their nearest facility was further away than i could afford to drive on my gas budget. i've tried talking about depression to most of my friends. i'm fortunate to have some great people in my life, but i've lost a lot of relationships because i was open about depression. there are people who don't understand, and they get angry at you when their misguided attempts to help don't work. there are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you makes them sad or uncomfortable. i don't blame these people. it is very difficult to deal with someone else's depression. that's nobody's fault, but it makes depression very isolating. i've tried to get professional help many times. i've had doctors who were helpful, but we couldn't afford them. i've had doctors who were unhelpful and made things worse. i've been put on medications that made me better for a little while. i've been put on medications that messed me up so badly i couldn't leave my house and had to switch high schools. this is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment. you have to be able to admit your deepest problems to yourself, and talk about them articulately with total strangers. i don't know a lot of people who can do that, even without depression. it is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly don't like yourself and don't believe you deserve to get better. i'm not telling this as a sob story to try and garner sympathy. i just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression has stories like this. we almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal.i hate when posts like this are all criticism, so i'll try to leave with something helpful. you have so much more power than you think you do to help another person. even when you don't feel like you're making a difference, the smallest acts of kindness can really touch people in unexpected ways. you probably don't understand depression. that is okay! we appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding. we're sick of people telling us they understand when they don't. you don't have to understand. you just have to believe us. 
i can go an entire day without talking to another human being.
i’m 22, senior in college, and some days i’m in up to four classes. if i don’t have to work that day, work requires me to talk, i can go through the entire day with having little to no interaction with another human. no one texts me throughout the day, no one talks to me before or after classes, and i feel as though no one even looks at me when i walk down the street, beyond the cashier at the cafe telling me my coffee and donut is $3, i feel as though i don’t exist. i’m not suicidal but that doesn’t mean the thought that if i’d i disappear the entire world would continue moving without noticing hasn’t graced my mind. to complicate things i’ve even walked by friends, best of friends, without them noticing me or saying hi, even if i make an attempt to. i try to just enjoy my walk but being surrounded by so many people makes me feel claustrophobic. today in particular i decided to dress nicer, maybe i’d get someone to notice me. i wore something my ex-gf had always thought i looked handsome in. the painful reality is that i felt even more alone today, more distant from the entire society of college that i wanted to run as far as i could away from it.people are always telling me that “if you want to make friends or meet a girl, you have to be the one to make that first conversation” but if that’s the case why isn’t any ever trying to make that conversation with me. thank-you for noticing me today. 
why am i so fucking tired all the time?
everyday is so monotonous and i have trouble doing the simplest things. everyone says it's going to get better, but i'm just getting more and more tired of all of this. 
i feel so silly getting sad over downvotes.
i thought this was my safe place. an accepting place.now i'm not sure where to go.i feel so alone.
i hate myself so much i take away the auto upvote from myself
i just feel like i don’t deserve it.
if i'm not going to kill myself, then i need to make my life better.
that's it. this has been yet another dumpster fire of a year. every year has been worse than the one before since 2016. this year was a banner year. one of my best friends lost her child. i lost my best friend of 20 years in the fall out. but if i'm not gonna call it quits, i'm just hurting myself. 2020 is time to heal. and that's my mantra. i hope it's yours too.
it hurts to exist.
don't get me wrong, i'm not suicidal. i'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. i'm just tired of existing. i just wish there was some way i could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. i'm sad all the time, and i'm sick of it. i'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if i don't then i get accused of attention seeking. i can't stand being alive anymore. i'm tired, mentally and physically, and i don't know how to handle it anymore.edit: thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. it means so much to me and, i'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. to all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, i'm not a certified therapist, but i'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it. i'm just a pm away to anyone who wants to talk. i'll listen. thank you all for making me feel less alone, and slightly more normal for a while.
my girlfriend dumped me, my best friend killed himself, my parents are getting divorced, and i lost my job.
i pretty much don't know where to go at this point. i keep telling myself things could always be worse and then things actually get worse and so i just repeat that phrase ad infinitum. lately it seems like the big man upstairs has it out for me.edit: holy butts this blew up. i'm overwhelmed with all the love people are showing. i'll try and answer all of you.
i am no one's favorite person
no one wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, i'm so excited to see her today! no one sits around and waits for me to text back no one's first thought when they're happy or something good happens is to text meno one asks me to call them when i get home no one cares enough to tell me, no, not another drinkmy mom would rather spend time with my brother and my dad loves my sister more than life itselfi am no one's best friend, i am not the love of anyone's life, i'm not anyone's favorite student. i'm not anyone's person. people care about me, sure, but i'm no one's favorite. there is not a single person that values me above all the rest and that hurts. i'm just another friend, another face to blend into the crowd. i'm no one special or important and it makes me want to cry. i'm not my best friend's best friend. i'm not my favorite professor's favorite. i'm not my person's person and it's fucking miserable. edit: i am so surprised by the number of responses. i had no idea that other people felt this way and, while i think we can all agree that feeling this way sucks, i'm glad that i could be a source of resonance for some people. and hey, fuck the world, let's be each other's favorite person. 
do you guys feel it too?
don't you feel like wanting people to just get off your back and leave you alone, except that you don't really wanna be alone?don't you also feel so sad that you internalize everything but you still hope that someone... anyone will just read your mind and come by to give you what you want to hear, except you actually don't know what you want and you can't tell them because you already know what they'll say?and don't you also feel so... defeated but you hope that maybe eventually you'll find a reason, maybe a person, or at least a way to cure this feeling... but not really?yeah sorry guys i don't really have a place to vent,  just wanted to share.edit: wow i honestly never expected this to get this much attention, thank you for the support guys :,)
do you ever get the feeling that if you tell someone you are depressed they don’t believe you?
this is hard for me to tell anyone because every time the talk about depression comes up i get told why should you be depressed. i don’t know what to do and i honestly just want to shut myself away from it all some times but there are others around me that will get affected by the way i start to act. i don’t even know if i should be posting things up as i n is the internet can be a bad place sometimes....  
mathematically, it isn't worth being alive.
if you live a banal life, you work for around 8 hours everyday. if you enter the time wasted getting to work (for me anyway) it's 2 more hours. it means that approximately 41% of your day is spent wasting your life away at a dead-end job. this isn't even including sleeping. if you sleep between 6 and 8 hours, it's 25% or 33% of you day gone too, leaving you with about 26% of free time everyday. in this time you need to shower, eat and go to the toilet so it's even less than that.&#x200b;i don't have any friends or lover. i don't really have anything i'm really passionate about so even the tiny fraction of daily free time i have is just spent trying to escape boredom.i won't kill myself because i don't want to bother my family members, but man, living is just a gigantic pain in the ass. i don't even think i'm depressed anymore, i just don't see a point in living, it's too much effort for me. i just want to wither away.
told my husband about being depressed for the first time today
he was so supportive. he held me, asked me if there was anything he could do to help me. he told me he would set me up with an appointment with a therapist if i wanted and told me i'm not alone. honestly, i duct expect otherwise because my husband is a rare find, a true gift and all around wonderful human. but depression had me by the neck, scared to let him in and it's lifted a huge weight to talk about my depression with him, and to be honest the first time out loud, to anyone, everedit: i just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your kind and support words, it means so much to me and it feels like there could be a light at the end of this tunnel for the first time in a long time ♥️ and gold?? wow i'm honored honestly thank you so much!
does anybody else feel like they want to find someone as lonely and desperate like them?
i'm often finding myself thinking that it would be easier if i found someone as lonely as me, to the point that we would be dependant on each other and kinda resolve part of our problemsdoes anybody else feel like this?
today a woman on the train looked at me and smiled and it honestly made my day.
i know it sounds stupid but it made me happy. i was feeling very sad and you could probably see it on my face. the woman smiled at me and it cheered me up because i was dying inside. sometimes the little things matter. edit: i wish she knew that she saved my life today because i was close to ending it. thank you stranger. 
dad died. no family left. slowly drowning in bills and debt. now i'm the sole provider for a household and i'm about to have a complete mental breakdown [29/m]
i really need some help.last year my dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of 66.  zero warning.  one minute we're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend, and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two blocks from the house on the way to work.ironically, he was in great shape and we worked out every weekend.  he didn't smoke or drink and his doctor said he had the fitness of someone half his age.  he was the pinnacle of health at that age, and this happens somehow.he was my only family and i'd been living with him for a few years after graduating college.  i'm one of those probably borderline autistic, zero social life kind of weirdos, who was in a position where his dad told me i could just live with him, work my job, and spend free time working on my passion, which was writing soundtrack music.in an instant my whole world - the only person who ever mattered - was ripped away from me.  the tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debts and the funeral, and i'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably.there are so many bills, so so many bills, and my job can barely cover them.  my fiancee has been out of work for two years due to an injury and i'm supporting both of us, while trying to maintain the house, with no friends or other family to speak of, and it's a battle i'm slowly losing every day.i don't have any time for myself any more.  i don't have time to exercise, don't have time to clean, don't have time to make music, don't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pays better than the first because i'm just at the end of my rope.and above all else i miss my dad, every single day.the one saving grace is that i also inherited his retirement account, which ironically he was never able to even touch.  and now i can't touch it until i'm 65 either, and i don't think i'll make it that far.  i honestly worry about being homeless, about having my whole life wasted because i'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and i can only take out one tiny bucket at a time.and i feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything.  some days i go to sleep and honestly hope i never wake up.i hate this.  i hate everything.  i hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life, only to end up in a happy place with my dad and then to have him taken away with no warning, no explanation, and no way to stop.every day of my life i want to cry, to breathe, to take a break from all this stress and sadness, and yet i have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and i will not be able to survive.i need a break from all of this, but i can't, because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water.i don't know what to do.**edit:**  hey everybody, i just wanted to say thank you for all your insight and thoughtful words.  i ended up going to bed yesterday after a bit of dialogue on this topic and had absolutely no idea this topic would explode the way it has.i'm going to try to reply to as many people as possible but honestly feel a bit overwhelmed (in a positive way, of course - i've never had so many people actually caring about me).  just please know that i've read everything you've posted and if i don't get back to you immediately, i genuinely appreciate all of your thoughts and kindness.
my partner of 5 years dumped me. i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i lost my job. haven't talked to anyone or been out of the house in weeks. yesterday a good friend died from suicide. it's too much.
a lot has happened in a very short amount of time. when shit hits it really hits hard.this christmas i got dumped by my so of 5 years. two months prior to the breakup he started being very mean and mentally abusive. i have abandonment issues due to childhood trauma, and he made sure to push every trigger. he was  my best friend. the only one i really trusted. and now he's gone.after the breakup i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i'm in therapy and on meds now, which helps a bit. but it's still so bad that i had to quit my job. i just couldn't go back there. i haven't spoken to anyone, except sent a few texts, since new years. i don't go out of the house except to go to therapy. i'm too afraid. i've shut myself in and everyone else out. my friends send me texts now and then. i know they care, but i just don't have the strengt to answer them.yesterday i got texts telling me that a good friend, the kindest guy i ever knew, had died from suicide. i feel so guilty. how could i not have known? what is i hadn't shut him (and everyone else) out. what if i could have talked him out if it? with depression comes thoughts of hopelessness, despair, feelings of not being good enough, being worthless. a failure. i've felt all those things. but right now i don't just feel it. it is me. i don't feel like a failure, i am a failure. there are so many 'what if's'. what if i could have saved the relationship. what if i could have saved my connection with my friends. what if i had tried harder. what if i had pushed myself and went back to work. what if i could have saved my friend.i'm so scared of being alone, yet i can't bring myself to talk to friends. right now i feel utterly and horribly alone.what if. just what if.edit: i never imagined getting this type of support. from the bottom of my heart; thank you. thank you for the kind words, the uplifting comments, the stories of your own hardships.i've always been introverted and never had a lot of friends. i used to play a lot of video games, but even on  online games i play alone. depending on someone, even in a game, scares me a lot. so i've never been part of a community. but right now, i feel like i've been in the wrong all this time. i feel like i might find something here. a friend, comfort, or someone to discuss the weather with. when i am stronger i'd like to be a helpful part of this community. i'd like to pay you back, or at least pay it forward.i'm doing ok. i try not to think. that's why i haven't written sooner. i couldn't bare to look at my phone. i read, watch hbo, read, hbo, read, hbo. i can't let myself think. when i think i see my dead friend or my ex. how i'll never be with any one of them again. i can't do that. i have to keep my mind busy.
does anyone else have a spotty memory?
i can't remember who i ran into today. i can't remember three days ago. i can hardly remember anything. if i focus i can bring up certain memories, but it's difficult. i feel like my brain isn't working right.
i just realized there are days when i don't talk to anybody
is anybody else in a similar position? i mean, there are days when i just wake up, get food by myself, go to class, study, go to sleep, and the cycle repeats. days when i don't even say a simple hello to even one person. it's not a matter of ignoring people, it's just simply hard for me to connect to the world. 
you miss 100% of the shots you don't take
well i also miss 100% of the shots i do take so whether or not i actually shoot is irrelevant. i have the same amount of failure either way.
i can't fucking talk for shit
i stay quiet all day b/c of overthinking or stand up for myself. fuck this man.
do you ever just stare at your computer screen and think of how pointless life is?

i've burnt black a pan full of beans and corn. fighting the smoke and fire was the best fun i've had in months and i feel totally satisfied.
after throwing the flaming pan out of the window straight onto the street i've been thinking and developing strategies how to get rid of the smoke and that horrible smell. it's awesome. i'm making herbal mixtures and boiling scent candles in water now. i feel like a shaman.10/10 would burn shit again.
anybody else tired everyday no matter how much sleep you get?

i hate people who call you ungrateful when you don't appear happy
sometimes when i appear depressed, people tell me that i should be grateful for the situation that i am in. it makes me feel guilty since some people do have it worse than me.
when your mind switches to embarrassed/angry/sad/negative and you suddenly hate yourself for every time you tried be attractive/cool/funny/smart and you're sinking into sickening greyness you only wish was death, wondering how you even go on when you are so disgustingly imperfect.

worst. advice. ever. for. dealing. with. depression.

just ran 2.5 mi at 2 am to stop me from killing myself
(on mobile so bad formatting) i couldn’t find any alcohol to numb so i did the only other option which was running. i’m home alone at my dads house all night bc he’s in the hospital and the rest of my family is at my moms house. i started feeling what i think was mania of some sort wash over me at about 12 and it really hit around 1:30 so i frantically searched for alcohol or even weed even though no one in my house smokes but found none of either. i thought about how we have an old treadmill downstairs so i put on a dirty shirt of my dads, chunky filas, and ill-fitting shorts and just fucking ran. im writing this at 2:32 am, having just finished running at 2:20. i can’t feel my body. i don’t even think i ate enough today to allow me to do this. i don’t know. i still feel like killing myself. so it was all for nothing. i hate this. why do i have to live like this.
existential depression
life in my opinion is not worth the struggle. we are literally born to go to school just so we can get a job that we will most likely hate just to pay bills for the rest of our lives. i don't understand how more people don't think the way i do. i fully believe that money is the key to happiness in today's society. being financially free and being able to do the things you want in life is the ultimate goal. college is pointless for anything other than being a doctor. even for engineering most of the classes we take have zero real world application and 9/10 you gain more knowledge in the work force than in college. a college education now a days is meaningless the only thing college does is allow students to pay $100,000 + just to get opportunity from a piece of paper. i'm convinced most people don't actually get smarter in college since its not even about learning anymore its about passing. i just don't see how life is worth is when there are more bad things than good. the burden i feel everyday outweighs the good. does anyone else feel like this? people try to convince me everyday that there is a reason to live but their words just make me feel worse as i continue to believe that life isn't worth it.
storms are comforting
i prefer a rainy day over a sunny day. 
the only reason i'm alive is to consume media
the only thing i ever have to look forward to is playing the next game or seeing the next movie or waiting until the next episode of whatever the fuckmy need for fiction stems from the hope that i can find something to lose myself in for a few hours. maybe a few days.i don't want to wake up in this world any more
do any of you have people that say i'm here for you. but never want to text them and vent because you feel like it would be an inconvenience to them?
i feel like if they really meant they were there for me, they'd text me and see how i'm feeling. but no one makes the effort. no one wants to dig deep and extend a hand it seems.. everyone says they do, but no one proves it..
did anybody else have a complete breakdown with crying, shivering, sobbing etc after realizing that you missed your life completely and wasted it?
been a month or so earlier. it lasted for a week max. it felt like a spear piercing my soul. i've never cried so much. i couldn't even go outside anymore without sunglasses. i often stayed up entire nights.i wonder if that was mid-life crisis? i'm mid 30.
does anybody stay up late to have sort of a “second day” that you control
every night i stay up as late as i can muster because i know that the second i sleep i have to wake up to the same wash rinse repeat life. i live with 3 other roommates, and once they all fall asleep, and it’s just me, i finally can feel a glimpse of happiness. whatever i do can’t and won’t hurt anybody (to an extent), so if i were to just die right then and there, no one could stop me. the scariest part is i feel relieved just thinking about it. no matter how hard i try to convince myself not to, the thought just keeps coming back, and it’s gone to the point where the thoughts just don’t stop, and any day at this point might be my last. i’ve attempted suicide but to no use. one of my roommates almost caught me, but he took a right into the bathroom before he saw me attempting to find a knife to slit my wrist. at times i wish he had caught me so i could have someone to talk to, but everything is temporary, so why bother him with needless worry. i have a will ready, my money in an account to divide equally to both family and charity, and next to no wills to live. at first i made all of these things incase i were to die, but now i realize i made it for when i end myself. i’ve talked to therapist after therapist, but to no avail, pills that don’t work, and friends that just can’t deal with me. the only reason i have roommates is to pay rent so i could afford college. just writing this makes me relise that whatever this world is, we are all just seconds in the grand scheme of time. if i were to die, all the regret and sorrow cause by me would mean nothing, so if i do end my life, i don’t really feel remorse with anybody i affected. why worry about me and my death? people die everyday, so don’t single me out because i “touched so many people”. just get rid of me and move on. well, that’s all i really have to say, have a good night. don’t let yourself get as fucked up as me, please enjoy your time here to as much  as you can, cause even though a second is short, sometimes a second is all you need.
anybody else just spend all day sitting around thinking up conversations that'll never actually happen?
like, playing through what you and someone else would say in the event of some unlikely circumstance? except, it seems likely at the time, that's why you're imagining what's gunna happen, but then it never does, because you don't ever actually talk to anybody, ever?me neither, haha...
i took my medicine everyday this week.
i realized my prescription that has three refills was written on september 9th, 2016. that means in 11 months i took two months worth of medicine. my girlfriend bought a white board with little sticker magnets, and i get a gold star when i take my medicine. i'm 28 yo and that shit worked like a charm.i love putting the sticker up and seeing how happy it makes her.
i wish depression was all like ‘aesthetic’ like it is on tumblr but what it really is is locking yourself in ur room for days and not eating at all or taking a bath at all. you kinda just stare at the ceiling feeling void wondering why cant u enjoy your life like everyone else

battling depression is a skill. here are some tips that worked for me.
after battling depression over the last year, i have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. the first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way i perceived happiness. before my bout with depression, i assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. happiness was my baseline, i didn’t have to do anything, and i just was content. of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. here’s what i discovered; being happy takes effort. being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. once i got my mind around this concept, i worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. it’s a lot like weight lifting. it takes a lot of effort, it isn’t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. however, it is completely worth it in the end. not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but i will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. here are the simple things i added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness i was stuck in: 1)	**talking about it.** i got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. we literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. after a few weeks it really started to help. i was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring so that put up with me while i battled through the darker times. 2)	**putting away the booze.** i don’t think i had a problem with booze, but it wasn’t improving the quality of my life, so i stopped drinking. made a difference. 3)	**exercising. seriously.** it might sounds cliché, but holy shit does this ever help out. lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. while you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. lift that fucking weight 7 more times, that’s all i have to do, just lift it. the physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain i was feeling inside and i was finally able to match my mind and body. being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. it also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, i was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment.4)	**gardening.** i never planted shit before. on a whim i bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers – about a $15 investment. best money i’ve ever spent. the process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. i read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. i live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but i have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. grow something. take care of it, and it will take care of you. try it out. 5)	**meditation.** i still suck at it, but it works. every morning before work i take 5 minutes for myself. i just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. 20 deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. in, out, in, out. simple. i added stretching into the mix. stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. do it again 2 more times. try it, right now.6)	**vitamins and water.** omega 3 (fish oil), vitamin b, multivitamin, vitamin d. take them. especially the omega 3 and vitamin b. after only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins i noticed a difference in my mood. drink lots of water. more than you are currently drinking now. it’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 7)	**daily log and journal.** the world isn’t out to get you, people aren’t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. this was hard for me to learn. pick 1 daily goal. that’s it. what do you want to accomplish today? what completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? need to make a phone call? need to pay a bill? need to wash your sheets? once task, one goal, per day. write it down, that’s important. write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. you might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. the feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. big or small. just try. 8)	**small improvements.** do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. get a haircut, trim/shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. look better, feel better, be better. small, tiny incremental improvements. you will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. 9)	**understand that it is a journey.** it’s hard. for you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. that’s ok. you can work towards a better life. some of the shit that i mentioned above takes 5 minutes. the activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. just fucking try it, please. pick a couple and try it out. you’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, i know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. you can help turn the tides. i went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. you owe it to yourself to try. i think you can do it. you’re awesome.  edit: speaka_engrish brought up a great point - just to tag on to number 8, keep your room clean! make your bed, wash the dishes, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. a clean room is analogous to a clean mind.edit 2: andnowiknowwhy made another great suggestion - find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. making something can become very meditative and self-asserting. whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. just don't do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. it can be very stimulating and i like to create useful stuff for my household. just googling the words easy diy and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r/crafts, r/diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.
does anyone else ever cringe themselves to sleep?
i always find when i am trying to sleep my mind wonders to all the stupid and embarrassing shit i've done and i just end up cringing so much i fall asleep, anyone else?
i feel like depression has made me see life in it's true form. and everytime i see people enjoying their life i think of them as being oblivious and blind to the truth.
i had to get that out. it's been on my mind all day. are there any people that feel the same?
i won the genetic lottery of depression, anxiety, a kind of fucked up upbringing, and tedious family dynamics.
my youth has been stolen from me by depression. my life has been stolen from me.my social circle has been completely disintegrated. i actually, genuinely, have no friends i can rely on. zero. no. one. my social media is a network of peers i am (irrationally) angry at for leaving me behind, abandoning me, having inherently better pathways for life.what the fuck does it feel like to hang out with friends, party, date, have sex, make fun mistakes and have optimistic hopes for the future, instead of mope alone in a dark room?
how many of you are so lonely but in reality you have loved ones
i have a fiancé. i have a mom who loves me to death. several best friends, two of which i can talk to about anything and i know they’ll still love me. i have a wonderful dog and a cat. i only talk to one friend super honestly about my mental health, but everyone else knows i struggle or have struggled in the past. but somehow i still feel so lonely. i wish i knew why.
i don't skip class because i'm lazy. i skip it because i literally feel like nothing and do not have the need to leave my bed and see people who don't care about me.

perhaps this can help some of us gain a new perspective...how things actually are.

lonely scumbag brain

does anyone wonder who would they be without depression or anxiety?
i think about how depression and anxiety has shaped me as a person, and how it has just become a part of my life. i wonder how i used to feel without it, was i carefree? was i happy?  does it define me as a person?
immediately after having a good time with friends i’m sad.
i can go somewhere with a group of friends, like the mall for example. when at the mall i have a great time, smiling, laughing etc. but then on the car ride home and the rest of the night i just feel sad. i don’t know why but one minute i’m super happy and having fun but the next i’m depressed as all hell and questioning why i’m alive. am i the only one like this?
not necessarily suicidal, but feel like it would be so much better to just not exist?
who else feels like this? where you don't really want to kill yourself, but if you could go back and never be born, you'd jump on the chance...
anyone else feel lonely around happy people?
i know this might sound backwards, but when i'm around relatives or friends who are having fun or sharing their grief, i feel even more lonely than when i am actually alone. it's like i am unable to take part in whatever they are feeling and feel left alone. i usually end up distancing myself from them by sitting slightly apart and it makes me feel miserable. it is perverse how you can be with people but feel lonelier than ever. 
do you ever feel so empty and sad most of the time even while you’re having fun?
its like there is something holding you back from even enjoying yourself and honestly my insecurities keep messing with me to the point im only focusing on them instead and i have this constant thought that everyone is not genuine with me and its just a lie or the fact that they feel bad for me 
i'm always there for people but no one is there for me
i always try to make people feel better and cheer them up but then when i say how i'm feeling i get told stop complaining. you're annoying. i have no friends. no family to help me with my depression. i'm honestly just crying rn because i always try to cheer this person up that i chat with online but then they say that to me... i feel so horrible and worthless and those words make me feel even worse. i really wish i wasn't here
has anyone else always felt like an outsider?
it always seems that no matter what friend group or people i am with i always feel like the outsider. it could be the depression talking but i wish it wasn’t always this way.
some people never have to deal with depression
it just blows my mind, ive been depressed since i was about 8, and i feel like i have never been truly happy, and i never will be truly happy. it’s even hard to realize that other people are happy, it seems like we are all just drifting, with no idea what comes next, so in the end what we do doesn’t matter.
my doctor was crying
about 15 months ago l found a psychiatrist here in michigan. she has multiple couches in her office and gives one hour sessions. she is a throwback as she manages meds and gives therapy at the same time. this is very rare nowadays. she also works on assignment and only accepts medicaires payment as payment in full. today l was pouring my ❤ out to her and she started crying. i couldnt believe it. she really really cares. this gives me hope in humanity and hope in the medical profession. just thought ld share.
i'm genuinely not interested in anything anymore. all my free time is spent feeling immense boredom while trying to want to do something.
all my free time now is spent being bored and being hyper aware of being bored. everything i was interested in, i can't muster up the desire to want to do it. books i wanted to read seem like a chore to read even a paragraph. podcasts and audiobooks i used to listen to feel like someone reading a textbook. tv shows and movies i could binge over and over again get turned off in 5 minutes, and whenever i try and find something new to watch it feels like anything i see sounds overwhelmingly dull. there's nothing to me anymore. i'm basically just a void.
i just spent the past 15 minutes sobbing in the bathroom at work because it finally hit me that i have no friends
it’s not their fault, it’s mine. i had tons of friends in high school, we hung out almost every day. i was always over at someone’s house, saving sleepovers, playing games. after high school i kept in touch with a few but you separate and move on somewhat right? made two friends in university, i dropped out after my first semester and just started working, everyday. i was and still am too ashamed to see some people because while they’ve gone on to do good things and good schools and good jobs i’m doing nothing with my life. i’m fatter, stopped caring about my looks, boring, working a dead end job. every-time someone asked to hangout i said i was already working. eventually people stop messaging. eventually people stop caring. i just finished up my shift and was scrolling through instagram after getting changed. i’m alone at work and i’m just waiting for my wet mop patch to dry so i’m just standing around in the bathroom being lazy and waiting. someone’s picture scrolls by of their birthday celebration, it’s in black and white, they’ve got big silver balloons behind them with their age, they’re dressed up, they’ve got a little tiara on their head, she looks happy and she’s tagged her friends who she’s out with. i knew her in school, not really friends and i’ve seen tons of pictures like that before loads of times, especially on instagram.  for some reason it just struck me, being happy out with friends, someone’s taking their picture, celebrating their birthday, they’ve got a little tiara and they look like a friggan princess. my birthdays coming up and i just realized no one will ever do that for me. i haven’t been ‘out with the girls’ like that in almost 5 years. no ones going to take my picture, get me balloons, let me wear a stupid little tiara and sing me happy birthday. it’s so stupid, i don’t need those things, i feel like a spoiled child but i just feel so alone. it made me burst out crying, and i can’t stop crying even writing this because i crave friendship but i don’t even know where to look anymore. and if someone were to come along and offer me their friendship, i wouldn’t even know what to do anymore. i feel so stupid. i have a loving boyfriend who would do anything for me and is my best friend but we see each other every day and sometimes you just need something a little different than the same person all the time. sometimes i feel so selfish and needy for thinking that update/edit: thank you to all that commented, i didn’t think my midnight ramblings would get this popular and now waking up to it and rereading it, i feel better having vented and crying it out. some of you gave deep insight on your own lives and what friendship means to you or how you’ve lived without friendship as well. i really appreciate that and i hope everyone here finds their version of happiness, regardless if friendship is in their future or not. i have two hangouts scheduled for the end of this month and may so if those go well i’m going to try and push myself to get back in touch with more people. while i do like my alone time, i also realize that maybe my friends who did keep trying to reach out to me maybe still do care, maybe they still want to see me and ask how my life is and i should take that chance to open up to people again. thank you for listening, your stories and your advice ❤️
i swear to god my depression made me dumber then a 5 year old
i'm a straight vegetable. fucking kill me. it makes it so hard to function at work and school 
spending the entire day keeping yourself busy and active feeling alright, then the first moment you get to yourself the empty feeling comes back.

i just want to sleep all the time
i'm tired of my life. i do nothing all day, always procrastinating. i want to forget all my problems and to sleep all the time. to be comfortable in my bed and to have good dreams.
i feel bad for everyone who is depressed
as someone who has struggled with depression, it really disheartens me that there are so many depressed people in the world. i mean, think about it. it’s heartbreaking. i wish i could hug every one of them and ensure them that everything will be okay. that life can be wonderful. so, i write this message in hopes that you make sure to treat yourself. make yourself laugh. enjoy a good book, show, film, or whatever that entertains you. take it easy. life may be pointless to you, but you can’t do anything about that so you might as well have an enjoyable time.i love you all and wish you a wonderful, wonderful day.
the holiday season can be hard, sometimes a nap and a snack is just what you need to clear your head

reading this today, i felt a little better.

seeing this made me feel a little better today

i made a list of things keeping me alive

i’ve been severely depressed most of my life. i’ve finally cleaned my room after a month of neglect. you’ve got this! don’t give up! it seriously does get better!

actually went for a run today... never done this before and i feel a little bit better now

it's complex.

‪you did it, that’s what matters.

this is a reminder that things can get better and therapy is invaluable.

i started gardening and it has really helped with my depression! i’m really proud of this little space

barely eaten anything since thursday morning. was hospitalized that night for si and cutting. husband hasn’t spoken to me since friday. this is the first food i’ve made or eaten. fuck you depression. go home.

.

this is my first post but i feel really proud of myself tonight! my first step to help myself

.

good info to note

stranded in a country after losing my passport. waiting for a visa outcome. didnt leave the room all day but finally at 6pm went to the hostel garden. it was raining, reflecting my mood. saw a rainbow. felt 1% better. just sharing.

xmas present from my sister. nice reminder that there is someone who knows my struggle and is there to help.

i thought this art so we'll reflected what were all feeling. i wanted to give this artist some recognition while reminding all of that we are not alone in this, and together we can get through it.

when u want to talk to someone but you remember you got banned from r/depression for absolutely no reason

this is what depression looks like.

for anyone needing to hear this 

it's going to be okay.

celebrate the good days #happy

you are right on time.

it feels silly to celebrate; but i got out of bed, showered, and dressed before the sun went down today! 
i stopped taking my meds last week (adderall) because my tolerance grew and i don’t want to up my dosage. ever since, i’ve been experiencing the worst depression i’ve had in forever. the rollercoaster i’ve been riding for the last week brought me to the point of wanting to just end it all a few nights ago. i was feeling really guilty this morning for what i have been putting my loved ones through. i almost fell back to where i was a couple of nights ago. but instead, i got out of bed, and just took a shower. now i’m laying in my moms bed. i haven’t said anything to her. but i’m feeling a lot better now. and i was able to avoid the longing to end my life.  thank you all for your posts in this sub. i stumbled on it this morning and it motivated me enough to get me out of bed. i didn’t even have the strength to move before. i’m so happy that i wanted to share my excitement with someone. but no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. thank you again! 
this was on my therapist’s wall. it has helped me and i hope it speaks to you as well.

has anyone else feel like they have become less intelligent after dealing with depression...
sorry, this is my first reddit post, i'm fairly new to the community. thank you for taking the time to read this.&#x200b;like (presumably) a lot of people, i felt as if i was incredibly smart growing up. i was able to start school early when i was younger, i had a near perfect gpa, i painted, i played multiple instruments, and my parents were pushing me to apply for top schools. my future looked really bright.however, in the middle of senior year (of high school), something felt really wrong, and everything began to fall apart (lol, that sounds overly dramatic...but just know that i really was not in the right state of mind). i couldn't get up to eat, i cried at random times at school, **(warning for triggering visualization? not sure if this would count as one) \*\*** i began to harm myself a lot (like i mostly beat my legs or arms with objects), and i was just deep into depression. i tried to commit suicide multiple times, **\*\***&#x200b;like i've experienced periods of sadness before this, but never as intense and for an entire year.luckily, i did well enough in school before all of this happened, so i was awarded a scholarship to let me go to community college for free— so i didn't completely self-sabotage my future. so i've been working on transferring for the past year.&#x200b;however, i'm so distraught. i feel like my intelligence has gone down the drain. i slur when i talk, i developed a bit of a lisp, i can't coordinate my actions to my thoughts, i even forget letters when writing (for example, i would write oadside instead of roadside or mozzera instead of mozzerella). i feel so, so disappointed in myself and it's ruining my self esteem. i even had to say the phrase i want to know what i originally got on my essay three times the other day to my professor because i couldn't remember how to say it, and he looked at me really funny.&#x200b;is this normal?? like i said, it's ruining my self esteem completely, and i feel like i'll never be the person i once was. i'm starting to relapse back into my depression because i feel so worthless, and i feel like i don't know what to do. i've tried reading more, downloading cognitive supporting apps (like luminosity?), and i've been sleeping okay and drinking lots of water. but i don't know. has anyone experienced something like this and was able to rework themselves back to the person they originally were? if so, how did you do it?or am i doomed to plummet even further than i am now...sorry if this question seemed pretentious or if i seemed pretentious in any way.
this helped me. i hope it does for you <3. we are all here to support each other. we love you.

an interesting view on depression and addiction, made me take a step back and see the truth in it.

i can relate

this really helped me

slowly accepting the fact that some (or a lot) ppl may never truly understand depression. and my energy to explain/educate them is finite. so i probably need to be extremely careful who i talk to.

this man > my therapist

has anyone else lost years due to this shit?
i wasted 7-10 years. pretty much what should have been the prime/best years of my life and literally nothing notable happened during that time. not a fun weekend, not a date, nothing
my fiancé started walking as a way to relieve anxiety and depression. now he shares his hikes in the english countryside as a way to help others, and to share beautiful natural places with those who might have difficulty accessing them otherwise. i hope you enjoy :)

never saw it like this until i was severely depressed (anybody else remember this?)

if your reading this, i don’t know you, and you don’t know me, but i just want you to be happy.
i just want everyone to be happy, and no one to care about me, i love anyone reading this if there is any. please just be happy. please.
came across this. hope it helps you as well

whenever i get too low o wear this shirt. i made it when i felt i was at my lowest it says the pression won't beat me and in the bottom it says push on, be strong ,keep living

you guys are a big part of my support system

i finally cleaned up the clothes all over my floor
after almost 6 months of having ankle deep clothes on my floor, i finally cleaned my room. it’s not much, and things have been getting worse lately, but i did it.
don’t give up on yourself

i'm proud of you

the problem with depression is that it keeps proving itself right...

just getting through the day is enough

i believe in you.

let's start doing weekly wellness checks with each other

found this. hope it helps someone.

this place could always use more positivity :d

gentle reminder to brush your teeth
had to go to the dentist due to an abcess and a tooth needing an immediate root canal. went back and they are now saying 3k for all the work needed. ill be making it through the treatment and payment plans over the next forever. but this is a gentle reminder to brush your teeth or swish some mouth wash. been in a bad spell of depression for the last year and a half but im in therapy now and we will see how it helps. but like many i stopped doing anything to take care of myself this is the hardest to break out of but seeing this as my result is upsetting. knowing there is a solution is helpful. i just have to make it through to the end
being proactive is the best thing you can possibly do

another pic i found on my facebook feed that i thought others might like. it's always good to be reminded of this.

depression needs to stop freeloading and kill me itself-like every other illness does-instead of telling me to do it myself

i am happy y’all exist~thank you.

it's calling me back

sometimes you have to will yourself to have a good day

idk who needs to hear this today, but you're important and you deserve to be happy.

i appreciate you guys more than you'll ever know you're like a second family

if you’ve forgotten/been unable to brush your teeth in a long time.
if you’ve been unable to brush your teeth in a long time you may have developed mild gum disease. if that’s the case brushing for the first time will lead to bleeding and discomfort.if you’re really struggling just buy some mouth wash, the cheapest i’ve seen is 70p for a normal bottle. using this just once a day can be a start.when you can start brushing your teeth use sensitive toothpaste such as sensodyne toothpaste. it will hurt a lot less and claims to repair damage. if it hurts, stop! when i’ve been at my worse i had to build up from mouth wash to 30 seconds then adding 10 seconds each time until i built up to 2 mins and then flossing.if you start to floss, use sensitive floss and don’t do it straight away after a long time, it can make the bleeding worse. work up to flossing.i tried to find this advice a few years ago but no one is really open about it so i thought i’d share. good luck!
stop overthinking happiness.

sophie t., you are an inspiration

being a parent with depression is hard

this is exactly how i feel

congratulations /r/depression_help! you are subreddit of the day!

for anyone who needs this right now.

i want to hug everybody on this subreddit
i won’t say it’ll be ok. i won’t say it won’t be hard. and i won’t say it’ll be easy. but i will say i understand. i’m struggling. i’m struggling so hard. i’ve been struggling for a long time now. it’s hard to get through each day, and sometimes i want to give up. i just want you to know you are worth it. i know these words may be meaningless. i know these words may sound cliche. but please keep going. you where born for a reason. you are here for a reason. you are worth it. please don’t give up. i wish i could help. i wish i could be strong enough to take all the weight of your sorrow and take it away. i wish i could give you a hug. but i can’t, all i can do is type this hoping it gets through to somebody in need. thank you for reading, i know it’s just words but i hope it helps a little.
you are beautiful

someone here needs this today.

no matter what they say.

i just read about a poor little 10 year old boy who committed suicide because he was bullied and i ask all of you to please keep him in your thoughts because he was one of us.
this morning, i read about a little boy who has had more than 26 surgeries and had to carry a colostomy bag around with him. kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. his family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. this poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.we are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. and those “bullies” are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. and unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.so today, i am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. if any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. please seek help. reach out to those around you because i would not be here today if i didn’t make the decision to seek help.best wishes:)

today is meh... (here's a comic)

i hate when people, don't believe mental illness is real, they want an explanation for something they can't see daily.

if you don’t have the energy to do something, try taking a micro-step
many people with depression obviously lack energy, ambition and motivation. thinking about accomplishing large tasks can trigger anxiety, which causes depression, which causes anxiety, and so on. it’s counter productive to think about the large task you have to do.a solution i found helpful for this problem is to take micro steps. just do the tiniest step you can towards that goal you have, and don’t be embarrassed by how small it is.for instance, if you want to lose weight, exercising is an obvious goal, but it can sound so painful and atrocious that you simply refuse to do it. on the other hand, you could effortlessly do a single push-up (or whatever exercise is effortless for you) at this moment. *boop.* it is done. you did it. it took 3 seconds. it didn’t hurt. you may be thinking, “oh wonderful, now i’ve done a push up, i’m still nowhere near my goal of losing 50 pounds!” yet, what i’ve found with micro-steps is they build momentum: - even if i only do one push-up, i’m better off than where i just was. - then, upon realizing one push-up was so easy yesterday, i can do another push-up tomorrow. it is still extremely easy. - then i do one push-up every day for a week. it’s still extremely easy. - then i do two pushups every day for a week. still extremely easy. and hey 14 pushups a week ain’t too shabby. - then i decide i’m going to add one more push-up every day of the week (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). it’s still easy. it’s just *one more* than i *yesterday*, which was easy. - then i do this for two weeks (14 push-ups at the end). i reach day 14 and while it’s no longer as easy as one push-up, it’s something i’m proud of now and i don’t want to break my streak. i’m doing hundreds of pushups a month now.. i hadn’t done a single push-up in years before this started. it’s still nowhere near as hard as i originally imagined. it hurts for a minute, then i get a body high. it’s enjoyable overall. wow, i see why people like this! unbelievable. people are complimenting me for looking healthier. unbelievable. i feel healthier. cant stop this now, it’s working!- then, a few months later i do this for 3 weeks- then 4 weeks..- and so on... i repeated this pattern and i’m currently up to doing 150 pushups 3x per week. i put on a podcast and take my time and don’t even think twice about it. it’s mildly annoying and then it feels great when i’m down. i have the strength to do 150 pushups a day now because i wasn’t ashamed to do that one pushup 5 years ago. if i hadn’t done that one push-up, i probably would have never done *anything*. taking the tiny micro step of manifesting your goals can build momentum that you desperately need when you’re in a depression funk. without any momentum you feel like there is no purpose. you are like a flower blocked from the sun. but even a small amount of sunlight can change everything, causing you to grow into places where you can effortlessly reach more sunlight. this also works for tasks you have to get done in the short term. have a paper due tomorrow? first thing in the morning, just open up microsoft word. you’ll think “well that was easy, i took the first step.” then you will consider how hard the second step is: a title. not hard. now you’ve done something. and it’s only 7am. i’ll take an hour break and then write some outlines... then i’ll write a sentence. ..then a paragraph... this is actually not so bad... once you take that first step of that opening microsoft word, things stop seeming so daunting. everything gets put into better perspective when you manifest your thoughts into actions, even in the most microscopically small way.
here’s an update to my room guys. thanks again!

how do you get over your emotions

i love this

upvote if you're feeling hopeless

wearing my social mask exhausts me
i feel like i'm losing my ability to cope with being around people. even those i like and am friends with? being around people has always felt like it's depleting a little hp bar somewhere inside me because i have some inner pressure constantly to be likable and interesting. it's shattering.but it's getting worse. i'm finding it harder and harder to resist the temptation of isolation and then fomo starts kicking my ass too. can't win. just feel miserable...
it kills me to see others in worse positions than i am. you matter. you all matter and it doesn't matter what your depression or suicidal thoughts tell you.
i'm in a similar boat with all of you, but suicide isn't the way out, and self-harm doesn't help. everyone i know who's self-harmed tell me not to do it. your life matters. i know it doesn't seem like it does, i know you're being told something entirely the opposite, but theres always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how long that tunnel is. it doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. please, you do, in fact, matter. you are, in fact, worth something. hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. if your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that i'd care. alot of people i knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them.&#x200b;please. do something. go on a walk, for example. it doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. i know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. i'm speaking from experience.eat something.  don't starve yourself. it only worsens the pain.&#x200b;you have to force yourself out of this. i know, all you feel like you're capable of doing is lying in bed, but it won't ever get better if you don't break the cycle. i know this seems like an impossible task, but do you really wanna wake up every morning wanting to die? i don't think any of us enjoy it. do you really wanna die, or do you just want these thoughts and feelings to cease? vent in the comments of this post if you want. i don't mind.&#x200b;talk to someone, anyone. you can even talk to me if you want to. your life matters. your feelings matter. don't end it. please. you matter.
enjoy the good times

you've got this, every one of you.

i need help. i procrastinate way too much it’s to the point where all my room literally is the most disgusting place i’ve ever been

i am not always very attached to being alive | an article about passive suicidal idealization
my girlfriend just sent me [this post](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation).she and i both teeter the line of depression and sometimes, i find myself unable to understand her. my depression comes out in bursts and tears and when it's happening, it's easy to see and hear and feel. for her, i think it's something different. she told me this article really put her feelings into words and made her feel like someone else understood and that someone else was facing the same feelings she was.i wanted to share it here so that others could see it and maybe be comforted by those words as well.i hope you are all doing well, genuinely and truly, and that something is making you smile today.&#x200b;
my friend killed himself after 8 failed attempts over many years. don't always trust their parents alone to do the right thing cause sometimes they just don't; they make it worse.
i'm 23 now, it's been a couple years since he died and i can't help but remember him on occasion whenever i experience something new or good in life. i just think if he didn't end it all he'd have seen the bigger picture eventually. it's never as simple as that but at the same time, it is; it's all about the timing.  he had it all. he was popular, had that ripped body everyone envied him for, had the attention of the ladies and had a wealthy family. none of that seems to matter one bit when it concerns clinical depression. it only got worse with whatever his dad thought was the best response which was to initially send him to live in another country thinking a change of scenery was all he needed after his first few attempts, that didn't really work either. his dad's solution was to just deal with it like a man ought to and so my friend confided in his grandfather instead of his own parents. this one time he jumped off the fourth floor of his house (wealthy family like i said) and only survived cause he landed on his car. shattering his skull and shoulder blades, he was back up and walking in a few months. the guy was a tank, a kick boxer and at the peak of his physique so he seemed to oddly survive his various attempts.   things settled when he got into a stable relationship for a few years and we grew out of touch but i heard he was doing well and had left the country with his significant other. the last thing i heard after that was how his grandfather had died and that they found he had hanged himself a few days after the funeral. his family didn't even tell his friends about it, they just had a quick and quiet funeral for him the next day and i only found out about it months later.   that was the end of his story but it doesn't have to be for so many others out there. please seek professional help for you or for those you know are going through cycles of depression. the worst way to deal with it is to leave it to conservative families that care more about impressions and manning up than being humble enough to band together when one is hurting and be supportive and nurturing.
threatening suicide as a means of control: it is toxic. don't do it.

well, this made me laugh until i almost peed, thought maybe it would make you smile too.

even for a second i hope this would make someone smile

a friend sent me this... and i found it amusing

i’d love to have access to mental health services without going broke

depression is not who we are

time stands still on tuesday, january 27th 2015. i was left behind after the suicide of my first true love. i am still so lost, trying to find meaning in all of this. much love to every single one of you.

im jealous of developed countries
sorry for any bad grammar, i didnt feel like fixing any mistakesim jealous of people living in developed countries, i really am.i was born in a joke of a country in africa, its just like the usual, crap healthcare, shitty education, corrupt government, locked in neverending wars, blah blah, and im not really sure what i can do about it,they had somesort of revolution recently but itll probably take years before any real changes happeneverybody is living like shit but theyre all so hopeful about the revolution for some reason, im not really sure whyits amazing thery all so hopeful even though everbody lives like crap, im really jealous, i wish i could feel the same wayand my family has been really helpful so far, giving me a bed to sleep in, food to eat and such even though everything is so expensive for them , i dont feel that im grateful enough, and theres alsso people living worse than me so i dont have any right to feel sadthe country is sudan if that helpsim attending a really crappy uni for medical school that i really dont care about, it doesnt have a professional looking website evenand the lecture halls are really small, it doesnt look anything like i saw in moviees and suchapparently if you can get a medical degree or an engineering one, you can work outside if you get really good grades, even in super advanced countres like australia or canada, but you have to pass some sort of really diffcult exam before you can get accepted and that worries me, because i dont think i can get motivated enough anyway to study for itim really jealous of westerners, they have everything they could ever wantthey have cool things like museums and space obsevatories and such, ive always wanted to go to one of these, or maybe a movie theater, ive never been in one before, while here we have nothingim sorry for rambling and my really crappy grammar, i just wrote whatever was on my mind and i dont really care about revisingthanks, just writing this down after bottling it up for so long feels really liberating, i feel so much better already, and usually im not in this much of a bad mood, ill probably get over it in the morning________________________________edit :sorry about the delay, i was a bit embarrassed to check this account after rambling for so long, and i was afraid i wouldn't get any replies...thank you so much for replying, everyone! i really can't find the words to express how i feel.all that i can say is thank you, and i hope you get through all your problems as well.finding some sort of medium to talk about my problems, especially in a country that doesn't take mental health seriously at all, it honestly feels amazing.it's just like some of you have said, people in developed countries can definitely suffer too. it's always a good idea to put yourself in other people shoes and see what they're going through. even if they're much better off than i am, they can still be depressed, and that's okay.there are also people far worse than i am, even in developed countries, and that's also okay.thank you for reminding me about perspective, and once again, thank you for replying. it really means a lot to me.
i’ve skipped 2 whole weeks of class and still don’t feel like going
i’ve been absolutely drained mentally. i tried liking college and studying but i just feel like i need some time off. problem is: i don’t want to disappoint my parents. they’re the best and deserve much better. i just don’t have any motivation at all to get up at 6 am, shower at 6:30, go to class at 8:30 and sit between strangers until 6 pm and be home at 7 pm.  i also fear of being a failure with a shitty job in the future but not even that motivates me to go to class or study every day.
i haven't hurt myself since september
i don't know who else to share this with. very few people in my life even know about my propensity for self harm. i've been doing it for 6 years now starting when i was 18. nothing major predominately on my legs and chest, at my lowest point i was doing it multiple times a week. it's been 3 months officially today since i last did it. it's the longer i've gone since i was 19 or 20. i feel some hope that maybe i'm finally getting better but like i said only 2 people in my life even know and both are reluctant to talk about it and i'm hesitant to talk about this with them because i don't think they would understand why i'm proud of myself for 3 months abstention. i know nobody will probably read this but god i wanted to share it. sorry this is such a rambling mess.
maybe this might help someone, it helped me. i wrote down all my ants, automatic negative thoughts, to get them out of my head and it felt like it wasn’t poisoning me from inside anymore. but now i’m covering the sticky notes with positives so i can quite literally override the negative ones now.

am i the only person who is depressed on new year’s eve?
for some reason i feel... empty and a feeling of sadness. yes this is supposed to be a happy holiday but i’m worried about what’s to come in the future. i really don’t want 2020 to be the same as 2019 so i feel a little bit pressured. is there anything that can make me happy for this new years? is anyone experiencing the same thing?
my fiancé started walking as a way to combat anxiety and depression. now he shares his hikes as a way to remind others about the beauty of the natural world. i hope this makes you smile today.

my victory for the day. sweeping for the first time in months.

1000% true!

love yourself enough to go for what makes you happy

u.s. regulator votes to set up 3-digit suicide hotline number like 911

if you're struggling, take a couple of minutes to read this.
hey there friends :)i posted this on r/suicidewatch but i figured maybe it belonged here too :) if you're here that means you're probably hurting a lot right now and i want to start of by saying that i'm sorry. i'm sorry that you're going through this, you don't deserve it and you're important to me. every single one of you.i'm also really sorry that i can't take your pain away. if i could, i would take it in a heartbeat, i don't even care that i would have to deal with it. you guys on here are my main priority. i've spent a lot of my time on here, messaging people to try to help and the things that you're dealing with are intense. i truly understand everything that you're feeling and it's all valid. you aren't 'weird' or 'wrong' , these feelings are very real and it's so so hard to be fighting with yourself all the time.i want you all to know that if i could, i'd give you a big hug and let you know that you're worthy and important and that it's going to be okay, even though it feels like the complete opposite right now. as someone who has and still is struggling with suicidal thoughts and self harm, i understand it's hard to just 'not' have them. self harm is as hard to quit as smoking or drinking, because it relieves pain for a short while, while building it up in the background that leads to it becoming an unhealthy addiction. i know how hard mental illness hits, and while seeing a doctor/therapist/psychologist is a great option, i know that it's hard to make that step. you might not be ready to talk. you might not be able to afford it. you might not be able to get to one by yourself. i understand. but talking about it is proven to help manage things. i can't solve your problems or take them away, however much i want to, but i can make sure you don't go through this alone. you can talk to me about anything whenever, no judgement on reddit or discord. my reddit is u/i_have_a_cold_soul my discord is i_have_a_cold_soul #3036a list of international suicide hotline numbers: https://ibpf.org/resource/list-international-suicide-hotlinesmessage me if you're struggling or if you aren't. i want to know, how are you doing today? once again, you guys are strong and brave and i'm proud of you endless amounts for fighting everyday, you're such a good job. you're great people going through terrible times and that's why you aren't going to do it alone. stay strong :) i believe in every single one of you. maxedit: hey you guys! thank you all for the kind replies! more importantly, thank you to those who reached out to me, i know thats hard and i'm so proud of you. don't feel disheartened if i don't reply straight away, or get your story confused with someone else's. i care about all of you, but i have to sleep and do homework and go to school too, as well as other stuff so im trying my best to help you as best as possible. i'll carry on helping, it's just a disclaimer, so don't worry if it takes a little while :d
sometimes your brain needs a software update

does anyone every feel like not being alive, but you don’t want to die?
it was a rough holiday season and i’m in a really bad patch. i’ve battle suicidal thoughts before and have managed to pull through. so i know i’m not suicidal right now, (if that makes any sense). but right now i don’t want to be alive but i don’t want to die, i just want to disappear for a little bit and be left alone. does anyone else feel that way?
please tell me there's more to life than relationships
i don't think i'll ever have relationships, friends or a girlfriend.  i'm a piece of shit holding on to a lot of guilt and shame for things i've done.  i don't think i can be around people for long knowing they would not understand or accept me.  there has to be something in life i can get lost in that's relatively healthy.  healthier than slowly killing myself.
sometimes you have to give yourself a pep talk

hey, you, go get in the shower (reasons and actual quick tips in the post)
go shower.    it takes 10 to 15 seconds to get your sadness-laden legs to drag you to the bathroom.  turn the water on medium-high to your comfort level. treat yo self and don't turn on the fan: give yourself a warm bathroom today to towel off in.  it will take another 8 to 10 seconds to get your clothes off. step in the warm shower.  as the warm water hits you it feels **amazing.**   i spent the last three days on on couch. i have no one to tell me not to. i couldn't get up;  i was heavier than before.   today i got in the shower and put on a pair of pants that don't stay up by worn-down elastic.  i'm still depressed. but i'm depressed in a nicer shirt and somehow i feel just a little bit better. don't get me wrong, i'll be staying home.   this isn't meant to be an inspiring life affirming post.   just one small thing to make everything be ok for one moment, and a little less terrible the next.  so take care.
sometimes, it gets real lonely. some days, i'm super happy. other days, there doesn't seem to be a point.

you just have to keep holding on, things will get better

apologies for being remiss
when i started this subreddit years ago, i was in a dark place. i felt alone and afraid and unwelcome most anywhere i went. i truly started it as a haven where i knew i would be accepted as it was a place of my own creation. however, since then, much has happened and i've grown a lot, learned a lot, and healed a lot. in that time, however, i also forgot many things- one being this subreddit. i found this once again by accident this evening and am honestly shocked and amazed at how it's grown. while i'm saddened to see so many people suffering from the horrible affliction that is mental illness, i'm also delighted to see so much support and banding together in such a tough situation. i also, however, see the need for an active moderator on a subreddit which hosts some of the most vulnerable going through the most difficult situations. for my absence, i am sorry. while i cannot say i will return and be that moderator (as i neither have the time and it would be detrimental to my own mental health), i can tell you i will work to find the appropriate replacement who will both reinvigorate this subreddit and act as a shield to potentially harmful content and information. it is truly a pleasure to be in the presence of so much love and support. please continue your efforts, and may you all heal quickly. thank you for trusting me and this subreddit as somewhere you can call home when there's nowhere else. 
lifelong depression has stunted my personal growth and i'm afraid it's about to put me on the streets
**edit: wow, i didn't expect this many responses. yall are really kind. i really appreciate your advice and support and it will take me some time to read each response carefully and find the words to respond to it. thank you all so much.**---[originally posted on r/advice as why am i such a pathetic loser and how do i fix it before it gets me killed? my request for advice was downvoted there and i'm worried no one will reply because of that. also, this seems like a better place to voice these concerns anyway.]i'm 26 years old. my problem is this. i'm a quitter with no willpower. i give up on everything before i've even had a chance to really try. i'm afraid of putting in effort, and if i'm *forced* to make an effort, i do quite well for awhile, and then freeze up at some point late into the process, panic, dig my feet into the ground, drop everything, and stubbornly persist in inaction until all my progress has been sabotaged. this attitude and approach toward everything i do has ruined my life.through elementary school and high school, i was eccentric and asocial, but brilliant. my performance was excellent, far above the curve, right up to the end. then, in the middle of 12th grade, i stopped trying. i didn't mean to stop trying. it was more like i couldn't try anymore even if i tried to try. like my try engine was busted. my performance declined immediately, and it was only because i'd done so well up to that point that i still managed to graduate with excellent grades.my performance up to that point got me a few merit scholarships, none of them in the area. one was for a school in pennsylvania. i'm from the bay area in northern california, and my single mother was poor and we wanted to save money by any means possible, so i moved to pennsylvania to go to college. this was perhaps too bold of me. because i was used to succeeding, i was spoiled and believed i could do anything effortlessly. i believed i wouldn't have any transition pains. friends, don't be smart, it makes you stupid.i did well for one year, but i was miserable. then i did pretty badly for most of another year because i froze up again and refused to make an effort. i felt like the world around me wasn't real, like every person and every building was made of cardboard and nothing i could do would have any consequence, so i just stayed in my dorm room all day every day. i wound up having to withdraw to avoid having it on my record that i'd flunked out, so i moved back to california to be with my mom again.my credits from pennsylvania couldn't be considered, so i had to go to community college for another, well, two years, i think? then, with my grades already ruined and age having made me less attractive a prospect, we bit the bullet and sent me to a local university without a scholarship as a transfer student, with money we didn't really have per se.i did kind of well for a year, and then started resisting my own progress again and having mental breakdowns. my second year, i wound up having to withdraw because i refused to make an effort any longer. i then repeated my second year and finished it. the year after that, my mother passed away unexpectedly and i had to withdraw again (though, for once, it's understandable).it's been 2 years since then, and everything since then has just blurred together and left me confused, but i think what happened was something like this: i came back to try again when i felt i was ready, i was wrong and wasn't ready so i had to withdraw again, i came back again, and (very recently) after fighting a losing battle to stay afloat, i just completely gave up and decided i'm fundamentally not good enough for this. i withdrew permanently, on the very year i was meant to finally graduate.i'm morbidly obese. while i was at the university back at home in california, i lost 130 pounds. i thought i could keep it up and achieve an acceptable weight. since my mom died, i've gained it all back.also, through all this school bs, i've never learned to drive, never gotten a job or even tried applying for one, and until three months ago, i never even lived on my own. now i'm renting a place with the money my mother's life insurance company paid out to me as her designated beneficiary. it's quite a significant chunk of money, so i'm fortunate enough to have some time to figure out how to be the adult i'm long overdue to be. but my time isn't unlimited.i was also very dependent on her. right up to when i was around 21 or so, she still bought me most of what i owned, still cleaned up after me and did my laundry, still drove me around, still arranged most of my meetings and kept track of the rest for me, still talked to people on my behalf because i didn't have the guts. i've since learned to do most of these things on my own, but even as i type this, there are around 15 bags of garbage in my studio apartment not taken out. i usually take out the garbage like any sane person, but for the past several weeks, i've been forgetting. i also don't brush my teeth and hardly ever get haircuts. i'm basically barely capable of caring for myself.also i don't have any friends. well, it's more like i refuse to have any. i show people a good personality, and they like me, and try to be my friends, but i freeze up and shut them out. i don't want them in my life. i don't want to hurt them by inevitably not being there when they need me, and i don't want to get hurt, either. even a disgusting slob like myself could get laid if i wanted to, people have even made advances on me maybe two or three times in my life, but i refuse connections like that, too. if anyone tries to get close to me sexually, that's an even bigger red flag to me than if they try to be my friend. i go into panic. i've literally physically fled sobbing from a situation like that once before.please don't judge me too harshly for this, but because of my refusal to be with others or be vulnerable, i'm so touch-starved that i actually bought a love doll. worst decision of my life. i don't know what to do with it now. i have nowhere to put it, and having it in my studio apartment, just existing, staring at me, judging me, makes me feel really horrible. i am going to have to order a hacksaw off amazon, take the doll apart, and discreetly throw it out with the trash.like i said, i have a financial buffer to figure things out, but my time isn't unlimited. i don't believe i'm capable of holding down a job. i couldn't even hold down school. my mental problems are just too frequent for me to function in society, and i don't even have any aspirations left that i actually still believe in or appreciate. but at the same time, that kind of attitude, where i'm willing to say i'm not good enough for a job without even ever having tried to work one, is exactly what i'm talking about when i say i'm a quitter and too afraid of making an effort at anything.once my lease ends, i'm seriously considering either disposing of most of my belongings and entering into voluntary homelessness, or moving out of state again in search of a less competitive housing market, one where i could work a job simple and solitary enough for someone like me to handle, like carrying boxes around, and still make enough money to afford rent. or both: disposing of most of my belongings, moving out of state to somewhere where it's safer to be homeless and no one i know can judge me, and dipping under the radar and into the urban wilderness.speaking of safety, that's where before it gets me killed comes in. the only thing keeping me from diving headlong into homelessness is that i don't want it to get me killed. well, the same could probably be said for most people, right? who would spend hours of every day making someone else richer if they didn't have to do it to survive? but if i don't become a better person soon, i won't have a choice. i'll wind up homeless, voluntary or otherwise, and if i'm not prepared for that, it very well might kill me. also, my obesity might kill me if i don't slim down.i know what i have to do. i've known that much for my whole life. i know most of the pure pragmatic *how* as well. what i don't know is how to find the strength.i don't remember ever not being miserable. i remember this time when i was 9 years old and kept wailing in a grocery store and pulling on my mom's arm. did we pass by a snack or toy i wanted? no. hardly. i'd just felt a surge of emotion come over me for no particular reason i could discern, and i was literally begging her to end my life because i was too afraid to try it myself. i was hanging off her arm and wailing out kill me in the middle of the store. i don't know why i've been so unhappy for my whole life, but i guess my senior year in high school was just when it all culminated and i couldn't put up with it any longer, and i haven't really been able to ever since.therapy seemed to help a lot, but needing therapy so badly you can't even get it together to actually leave your house to go get it can be quite a predicament.how do i fight this?am i just not good enough to live?
realest shit i've seen this week

thanks to this subreddit,im not going to kill myself,thank you all for your support
if i can hug everyone who supported me and told me it would be okay  or upvoted me last night i would,it really means alot that you guys actually gave a fuck about me and listend to my story,even tho i might fail today quiz (it will start 10 hours from now) but you gave me hope that maybe i will actually,become a good person,last night i almost killed myself (i literally had everything prepared to kill myself but you saved me),thank you dudes,we will never meet in real life,but you are more than family to me,
i hate keeping so many prescription bottles on my bedside table. so i got this, and it’s adorable. when you pull out that day’s box, the next one slides down. i’m embarrassed by how many meds i take. this makes it kinda fun.

just wanted to say i’m in a much better place now. thank you guys for supporting and lifting up everyone in this community.
you are all truly great people. if i can feel better, everyone can. i’ve been doing the opposite of what i normally do everyday and i finally feel free.
and then there's those of us that wakes up fallen apart anyway

happy valentines day for all of those in struggle or are lonely.
even though i have never had a girlfriend (mostly because how fucking weird/strange i am), i wanted to share the love this year. for all of those who are in the struggle together, or are very lonely, i wish you a happy valentines day, and i wish the best of all of you guys. may you find true love.i always try to remind myself that nothing is certain, everything can and will change (for better or worse), which means appreciate the moment for what you have, and don't lose hope for what you want or need.
i’ve lived 5-6 years longer than i ever thought i would, here’s my messed up story
i made this post because it breaks my heart reading so many people who want to die, so here’s my story and how i am now. i also posted this to suicidewatch but for some reason it was taken down by the mods, but that isn’t gonna stop me from sharing it. i began self harming at 13 and i would cut myself every damn day for years. when i was 14 i got so fed up with the world and who i was that i started taking pills for relief. one day i swallowed as many as i physically could (think it was 100mg each) and closed my eyes to rest. woke up throwing up and feeling so disgustingly sick and this sick lasted for weeks. i couldn’t eat proper food and i couldn’t hold too many liquids either. my liver was so fucked up for long. i couldn’t even take one pill anymore without so much physical pain. i remember the day i tried to end it by cutting open my arms. it was a cool fall day, probably mid september or october. nothing bad happened that day, i just was so fucking sick of it all. i grabbed the razor i usually cut myself with and just went as hard as i physically could down and all over my wrists. holy shit the blood was terrifying. as soon as i saw the blood i immediately covered both of my arms up and did my best to stop the bleeding. the cuts actually weren’t that deep and i didn’t hit any veins so i was sure i’d be okay and just move on with my life. the scars were pink and very visible for years, and by that i mean everyone could look at them and see what i did till around my 18th birthday. in march of 2018 they were basically white and no longer really puffy so i decided that i would cover the one on my left wrist with a tattoo. that healed me emotionally so god dam much. i have a rose on my left wrist and the stem covers the scar so well that you can’t even see it anymore. it just looks normal. after i got the tattoo i realized how free i felt; my past really was gone for good and i could move on. this year (literally on my 19th birthday) i got another one but it covers the deep purple scars i had on my upper arm. it’s a floral band wrapping around my upper arm completely and oh fuck did it hurt to get done. but i shit you not, i almost cried after getting it because i felt... it’s indescribable. as for my body after the pill addiction and pill od.. that’s a different story.i have ibs now because i permanently fucked up my intestines that badly. nobody in my family knows this is why i probably have it but that’s what a private meeting with my doctor concluded. my liver is healed and i can actually take 2 250mg pills for a headache, but that’s all i can handle without pain. i have a great job, amazing support system, amazing boyfriend, and even though life can be tough, i always remember i’m tougher. i survived two serious attempts and here i am at 19 having the time of my life. five years ago i didn’t even think recovery was possible and now i haven’t cut myself in probably 9 months (it fuckin sucks kicking that habit), i graduated high school (never planned on that), i have a great job that pays $17 an hour (and that’s just the minimum for my trade, i’m gonna keep going up) and life is just so great in general. recovery is possible and it’ll take years, i’m still getting better and trying to move on from it all, but it is worth it.for those who read the entire thing,yay! thank you so much. i’ll be making a post soon about how i got through all of this i promise!
coping method that works for me
you know how sometimes you literally can't control your thoughts and it spirals out of control and all of a sudden you're thinking about how that one time when you messed up makes you want to crash you car into a tree in the hopes it'll kill you?well i've sort found a good way of coping with that. it is very simple. just say out loud to yourself: i don't want to be thinking about this right now. let's think about something else.at this point in my recovery i'm able to just think it in my head when i detect some toxic thoughts and move on. but starting out it was quite hard. i would say this sentence in different variations depending on where i was and what i was doing. when i was driving i would say hey, let's not think about this in a car. or i would district myself with a i wonder what's on the radio. what stations are good? i hope 105.3 the shark isn't just playing commercials right now. or maybe i should listen to pop music.if i was walking down town it would be i should go to the library or i wonder that store sign is still up even though it's been closed for years now. basically say out loud to yourself anything that isn't what you are currently thinking that is neutral in emotion. you don't want to go straight from toxic depression to toxic positivity. take a neutral stance on your state of mind and surroundings and comment on that. overtime it can become a good habit that can stop panic attacks before they happen.
for those of you who are going through tough times i hope this helps!. (i hope it’s not a repost)

if you're sad, look at this happy puppo till you arent

how to get out of your comfort zone

i don’t want to die, but i don’t want to exist
my depression has been really getting to me lately. i feel apathetic about life. i have moments of contentment, but most of the time, i just don’t care. nothing matters. i just want to sleep all day.i’m sure my job at the thrift store isn’t really helping any. my manager has created so many rules and regulations that i never want to go in anymore, but i have no other job to fall back on. no sitting down on the clock, don’t talk to your coworkers for more than a few seconds (even if it’s about work), bathroom breaks need to be taken on our breaks or you need to be out within five minutes, you have to get a doctor’s note even if you just have a common cold... if you get off work early, you can’t come back in and shop, you can only shop on your days off. i’m trying to remember them all, but it’s nearly 11pm, and i’m tired, so please forgive me not listing all of them. i’m not even sure i know all of them, since they change from day to day. but i still feel sort of guilty. i have a job. i should be thankful, even though i often wish to just run away. i have a home, i don’t have to pay rent since i live with my grandparents... but living with them, and all their cats, and my nana’s nephew that has an intellectual disability that calls me fat, lazy, useless, etc., it doesn’t feel much better. i would like to just appreciate what i have, like people tell me to all the time... but instead i just feel sad. and i don’t feel like i can really tell these things to people. i fear burdening my boyfriend, i fear my therapist putting me in the psych ward, and i stupidly let it slip how miserable i’ve been lately to my psychiatrist, who has upped my dosage and also insists i speak with case management and move out. which that’d be great, only i’m too depressed to take care of myself half the time, and despite the huge amount of stress my job causes me, it doesn’t pay enough for me to survive on. not even the minimum level of survival. is there no way to feel joy in life anymore? is there no way to end this perpetual cycle of being tired and stressed all the time? have i just rambled on nonsensically? i just want to *want* to exist, at least, instead of thinking, *”i’d have no qualms with dying today. not waking up would be fine. if some entity just snapped their fingers and i was erased from time and space, that’d be swell.”* on a side note, i intend to be up a little while longer, but i may fall asleep. some nights i can’t sleep until 2am, others i can’t even make it past 9pm, but i never want to get up. i only do because i know if i don’t, no one is going to help me when everything starts falling apart a month from now.
having a bad day? here is a baby hedgehog smiling.

a short(ish) guide on showering
  a short(ish) guide on showering. i have marked this post as not safe for work because i talk about my ass a lot. thanks to everyone who takes the time to read.ah yes, personal hygiene, the bane and all consuming nightmare for anyone who cannot bring themselves out of bed. we as people try to bribe ourselves, if you get up and have a shower then you will feel better, but that bed is so comfortable, and its not like you’re going anywhere, why should you have to shower? the biggest reason i can think of is because its very very very simple. because it makes you feel better.we still get up to pee, what’s so hard about having a shower? well when i say everything people usually laugh. the idea of taking off the pyjamas you haven’t washed or changed in give or take a week is like peeling back the layers of your failure onion, looking at your matted crusty greasy hair is like looking straight into your birdnest of shame. trying to even attempt to trim the hair on your face, or armpits, or where have you feels like you’re battling a particularly stinky yeti that tells you that you suck. noticing you still have mascara goop in your eye from that one day you put in effort is like a glaring unhygienic reminder of how completely worthless you feel. you feel vulnerable, naked, figuratively and literally. and then there’s the smell, as someone who has gone for weeks without showering i can tell you that the human body is not a garden, it’s a waste disposal centre of epic proportions. you smell from everywhere, and your butt cheeks feel like they’re kind of glued to each other. and when you finally get to that point where you are ready to turn on the shower and you step under, it’s like you’re a snake, shedding your own skin. and the water washing off you is definitely not the right colour. so why the gruesome picture you may ask? because it’s a reality for so many people, and it perfectly illustrates why depression isn’t a simple quick fix, it’s a years long battle. the idea of your ass smelling and your sheets having a skin imprint on them is so completely unpleasant, even to me as someone who has been there. it perfectly illustrates just how strong the hold is on people who are fundamentally good people. how strong the shackles on our minds can be. so what about this guide, you’ve personally illustrated very well what its like to not shower, how can i get to showering? the answer is hard to do in the real world but its so simple to write down: do the minimal effort and get the maximal pay off. you start small, ridiculously small. pick a body part, even if its washing your hands after you pee instead of walking to your fridge and then crashing back into bed. if that’s too much then trim your finger nails, hell, trim one finger nail,. every single goddamn day. when that doesn’t feel like a gargantuan task of epic proportions that makes you want to cry at the thought of it, then add a finger nail, or fuck, do one and a half if two feels too much. i started, by washing my genitals. for smell related reasons, obviously. i didn’t shave, i didn’t do anything fancy, just some ph neutral soap and a bidet, that’s all, the main reason i did this was because i went to the bathroom every day and that involved putting my pants down, it seemed like an easy place to start. and i did it, for about a week, and then i stopped doing it for a day and it made me cry because look at you, you layered dirty onion of shame and disgust why cant you even wash your own ass, what are you? a fucking baby, cant even do that one fucking thing, you piece of shit. that’s what happens, and i’m sure it might happen to you, and you’ll crash into bed and resume whatever you were mindlessly watching as you hope your over rested, creaky, aching body will just fall asleep again even though you slept for 16 hours. it will happen, and my advice is:tell yourself to that what you didnt do is okay. dont excuse yourself, but realise that failure is not a curse word, its a reality of life. that’s how depression is combatted and it is a fight, but instead of you murdering the crazy 88s like the badass you are, you’re in a room with yourself, no lucy liu, no gogo. just you and your head. and instead of a hanzo sword you have to fight your own brain that is biologically programmed to tell you you’re a piece of shit. and its hard, its hard to fight that voice in your head. but you know what wasnt hard for me? washing my ass, i made it as easy as i could for myself, and after that one time i kept doing it, because i told myself that it was okay to fail, to strive to be better.i know the follow up is “i’m so depressed i don’t even care if i smell, i don’t care if people see me like this, i don’t care if i die from ass stank induced shock”. i’ve been there myself. and these depression guides seem to gloss over the fact that even the simple act of caring can seem like an impossibility. here’s what i found out: caring as a depressed person isn’t there, it has to be created. a lot of the times people will ask a depressed individual to choose something they care about and then “do it for them” comes out. but it doesn’t work like that. you have to do it, and the caring will come later. you have to in a sense rewire your brain. i don’t wash my ass because i love my parents and don’t want them to be disappointed. i wash my ass because i like my ass to be clean, and smell decent, i didn’t care what it smelled like when i started, but i started caring because when i went to pee, i wasn’t greeted by a horrible smell and a constant reminder of my failure as a human being, because hey you know what brain, its okay, i cleaned my ass, and even though i did nothing else, i still cleaned my ass and that’s more than i did before. and i can say i am proud of it.consider for a moment that your brain, or rather the imbalance within them are trying to make you do all these things you don’t really like, and on top of that this imbalance is also making you not care about the inability of doing these things. that’s the part you have to say fuck you to.wash your ass, start with something small (or in my case big, get it, i’m saying my ass is big haha, i’m so funny). and the caring will come, and after the ass, you can move on to washing your hair, or brushing your teeth, or even just trimming a fingernail, or drinking one single cup of water, the caring will come later. and when you do wash your ass, be nice to yourself. here i will help you, for when you have done the one hygienic thing:an achievement to ….:hereby i wish to say that …………………………. partook in an act of personal hygiene, an achievement that should not be overlooked, a wondrous day for mankind. she or he took the time to perform this task, even though it probably sucked and no one is more proud of her or him than i. it is with great pride and pleasure that i say that this act of personal hygiene is something we collectively, as a society should be proud of and no one should be more proud than the person reading this, who took the time to perform this task.that probably came off as sarcastic and petulant, but the message is there, don’t punish yourself for doing something, that in my experience is the best way to break your cycle. because its so easy to go “yeah you did one thing, but look at all these other things you suck at, look at this bed, look at this house, why is the pizza box moving, because of you, asshole”. you have to stop it. i’m not saying you need to build a parade every time you wash your hair, but you also shouldn’t be tearing yourself down for it, you did something that feels so big and so difficult that you cant do it every day, and that is an achievement.take the time to feel pride for your smallest accomplishments, allow yourself to feel okay about something. and even if you cant bring yourself to say good job to you, be neutral. its okay to just say okay and try again. thank you for taking the time to read this, it was way more ass talk than i intended and isnt exactly short, but i hope it got my point across. i hope you have an okay day.
i cancelled on a friend and wanted to self isolate. instead of ending the convo at me not wanting to hang out anymore, she left the offer standing in case i changed my mind. she has no idea how much that helped me. it made the anxiety go down. i feel safe and less pressure.

feeling guilty even though i shouldn't be

most of the times, parents don’t know how to handle a child with a mental health problem. family support is vital for recovery and improvement.

to all my friends and fellow fighters, if you're considering suicide please just hear my message, please.
wait buddy i know it feels like there is no way out of this, but the way you're feeling right now will change if you give it some or  months of time.why i can say for sure? because i have been there my friend it took me 2 god damm helliesh years to get out of my own pit hole.trust me wait, nothing is permanent thigs do sort out eventually.you can hit me up in pm if you wanna talk.
when the rain comes, it rains, but it doesn't stay.
jim carrey told inews, “at this point, i don’t have depression. there is not an experience of depression. i had that for years, but now, when the rain comes, it rains, but it doesn’t stay. it doesn’t stay long enough to immerse me and drown me anymore.”people with depression have a hard time separating their thoughts from reality; they can often fall victim to black and white thinking. this means that they view everything as all good or all bad, and can’t see any grey area. however, if you detach yourself from your ego and simply view all of life as an experience, it can help you move through your journey on earth in a more fluid way.
you deserve to be happy
im sorry for offending all of you that was not my intenti had a really bad day so i was just trying to brighten yoursi may not understand the extent of what your are going through, so im sorry if wishing you well was triggering,i apologize for any feelings ive hurti wasn't trying to force you to do anythingi was simply trying to wish you well(i understand that you are upset but death threats are a little much)
this really puts things into perspective..

being positive is the dumbest advice ever
when you're depressed and on a bad luck streak, positive thinking makes things worse because it does not help at all. in fact, it makes you more depressed because it just leads to more disappointment. the reality is negative or positive thinking isn't going to change any situation that has outside influences such as being in financial distress, jobless, homeless, or a bad relationship. you're purely dependent on the mercy of others. if you're depressed, don't waste time on positive thinking, words of affirmation, and all the other bs people try to suggest. it only makes you depressed. just work hard, have no expectations and maybe the law of averages may swing your way at some point, just don't expect miracles or when you need it most.  i know a lot of people don't want to hear this but it's the truth. don't make yourself more depressed by lying to yourself and living in a false reality.
so i set my alarm for 0900 and got up at 1015! it’s an improvement because i didn’t get up after noon......

but then what am i supposed to do with this pain? keep it? drag it along with me forever?

you have worked so hard to pick yourself up and i am right there with you
i always feel like no one takes time to appreciate how difficult it is for us to do all the things we are doing. we woke up yesterday. we might have gone out to get groceries. we might have talked to an acquaintance at work. we might have washed the dishes. maybe we took our dog for a walk. it sometimes sucks to think that these 'simple' things that are negligible to most are humongous obstacles to us, but i want to take the time to say that i know it's hard and i couldn't be more proud of where you are right now. even if it's in the worst moment of your life, it's been such a long and hard journey to get here. i cannot express my pride for us all and i can't wait for what we can accomplish once this is all over.
anytime!!

got a tattoo because i fought the worst days of my life & abstained suicide

my girlfriend is suffering from depression, and i’m looking for some advice on how i can be more supportive.
for some context, we’ve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. she’s been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and it’s been especially bad in recent weeks. she’s a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not she’s making correct decisions for her career. this causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. i know that i can’t cure her depression, but i want to do all i can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. recently she’s been saying she doesn’t feel like it’s fair for me to have to deal with her when she’s like this, and she’s worried that’s it’s having a negative impact on our relationship. i’ve never really had to deal with depression as closely as i am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. i always try to be supportive, letting her know that i’m here for her and that i love her. it’s been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, i haven’t had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. i appreciate any advice you guys can share.
<3

how to describe depression to someone who tries to understand you

enjoy, my friends

i don’t know how to tell my dentist i haven’t been brushing my teeth.
i’ve been in a depressive episode for a while now. i haven’t been brushing my teeth. i’m constantly ashamed and anxious about it. i’m an adult. and i have been putting off going to my cleaning. i have to do it in a couple of days and i always tell myself i’ll start before then but i don’t. i don’t know what to say. i am so embarrassed. has anyone else done anything like this? i would feel better just knowing other people have gone through it and how they handled it. thanks guys.
if you're glued to your bed right now...
take a second. breathe in, breathe out. remind yourself that being idle will not solve any of your problems. do your best to get up out of bed. stretch your legs, touch your toes, bend and twist and work out the kinks in your muscles and hear your joints crack as they come alive. brush your teeth, take a shower, and put on some nice clothes. pick out your favourite outfit and wear it out for a walk. wear it to school, wear it to work, wear it to the grocery store. get fresh and try to focus on feeling pride in the fact that you, an individual, came up with this outfit. you got out of bed, brushed your teeth, took a shower, and came alive. it helps a little bit. it helped me today after i woke up and cried for about an hour. you guys should try to skip that step if you can, i don't recommend it. it can be therapeutic sometimes tho. much love to y'all, good luck. 
depression

the day after i told my friend that i'm depressed and suicidal.. i'm overthinking or it's just a joke? what's next to do?

how can i lose weight when i can barely function?
i will die alone unless i manage to fix my body soon. but i can't find the energy to exercise after or before work, which drains me physically and mentally. i don't know what to do. i just wish i could come up with the courage to end it already.
having a positive conversation with yourself

you don't need therapy every week, it's not like you were abused
my mom can straight up go fuck herself. she's the most ignorant, narcissistic piece of scum i've ever known. all she cares about is how much money she'll have for herself for retirement than my declining mental health. no, i may not have been physically abused but i sure as fuck was mentally abused, and she's still abusing me to this day.she doesn't wanna help pay for my therapy every week so fuck her, i'll pay for my own therapy with what little money i have until i go broke because at least i'll be on the road to getting better. every time i've tried to have a calm conversation with her about my therapy she'll immediately start yelling and insulting me, and she'll make my depression out to be nothing more serious than just a little boo boo.she's another classic case of a family member who doesn't understand how serious a person's mental health is until it's too late. if i killed myself, then she'd understand just how fucking serious my mental illness is. it makes me so mad knowing that that's the only way she'll get it. and even then she'll make it all about herself and say something like i wish i could've been there for her more. she can go eat shit.
too ugly to go out in public
do you ever feel like you’re too ugly to leave your house...well i feel that way every single day and that feeling never goes away. i’m soooo insecure to the point where i avoid looking people in the face let alone the eyes, i don’t even like conversing with my family for the same reasons especially since they’re really beautiful and confident and i envy that about them. i always make up excuses to not leave my house which makes my family surmise that i’m anti social and a loner but i’m really not. i wish i could do what normal people do but i cant so it’s not that i don’t like socializing it’s just that i physically and mentally can’t which sucks because then i have to say home all day everyday which leads to me feeling tired and lethargic the entirety of the day and not to mention morbidly bored. i’m just so sick of being like this. i wish i had a normal life.edit: more context for those interested.. i compare myself to others all the time have it be to my mom,sister,cousins,friends, random people on the street or people on the internet and it kills me!! it all started when i was a kid (6-7) and my mom along with my sister used to tease me for my appearance which they deemed not pretty enough or not girly enough. whenever my mom and i would get in a fight she would bring up all my insecurities and it made me feel like shit, she would also compare me to other girls (sister,cousin,friends...) and point out areas in which they are better than me and then she’d end it by saying that i will never find happiness and that no one will ever want to date/marry me which is now always in the back of my mind. then we have my “friends” at school who did almost the same but they would say it in a way that it almost sounds like they were giving me advice or something. so they would say things along the lines of “you would’ve been so pretty if only you didn’t have “blank” ...etc which made me so aware of my insecurities hence how i feel today. throughout my childhood and early teenage years i’ve garnered comments about my appearance that can last me a lifetime and it always revolved around either my face or the way i dressed up. i’m 16 (sophomore) and during my first two years or high school i’ve had people scorn me for my clothes being too old fashioned literally all the time, they would be hysterically laughing in my face to which i always laugh along pretending i wasn’t deeply hurt which i suspect what made them keep going with the ruthless jokes. sorry, this is all over the place but i just kinda needed to let some of it out, it kinda helps. btw this is but a fraction of what i had to put up with for almost 10 years my life (more than half my life.)
angry that i am always there for everyone else but they are no where to be found when i am in need.
i've been unemployed for 5 months now, slowly losing my entire life savings. i'm old and tired of trying to start new with jobs. a few years ago i took a huge leap and got additional education in the hopes that it would equal a better salary and better mental health. my partner abused me for over a decade and when i finally left last year i couldn't keep my job because he was stalking me. plus, the job was super stressful and i couldn't deal. now, months later, i am stuck and every one i reach out to has let me down. i am trying to keep positive, but the rejection of job interviews and applying to hundreds of jobs has worn me down. i am pissed that my friends and family seem to have no empathy.
can we compile a list of resources or action steps that have helped people? this sub is called depression help. shouldn't there be a sticky post or faq for where to start or at least some more resources that can help. websites, medications, techniques etc.

have a good day

i havent hung out with a friend for about 2 years and now that i have some friends who i can hang out with i dont know how im supposed to act or what im supposed to say so i just sit there quietly. can someone please give me some advice or tips on how to properly socialize?

i am ready to move on.
i am proud of myself. i got emotional this morning because i finally decided to keep the past in the past and just move on from all the shitty things that have happened to me. i'm ready.
i take 5 hours to leave my bed
i need help, i feel like dying so much that i don’t even want to leave my bed now.
take care of your depression

i’m 16 with responsibilities of a 30 year old..
so i moved away from my mom last year to live with my dad. he was crazy so i wanted to move back with my mom. he ended up calling the police on me for ‘running away’ and my stepdad decided that because of that i couldn’t come live with my mom again. so i am living with my boyfriend in a trailer that my grandma owns in a completely different town from any of my family. i have no adults helping me with food, gas, anything. i hate it so much and it is so hard to function because i am not able to have any fun with any friends because i have too many things to do, such as cleaning the house every day while my boyfriend just trashed it. i am overwhelmed and think about just ending it all a lot.
not having a set schedule makes me “lazy”. i work 3 12s a week and do fine when i’m working, but when i’m home and done have anything scheduled i can’t convince myself to wake up before 1100 or get anything done! anyone else?! does anyone else have suggestions?

dunno if this has been posted but it may help some. stay strong.

i came across this pic on my facebook feed. everyone's situation is different, and things that work for some might not work for others. all the same, things like this help me realize when it's my depression talking rather than me talking. i hope this helps at least one of you guys.

made me really happy

you've come so far. you can do it. ❤️

does anyone else physical hurt when they try to do things they use to like?
for about the last couple months, anytime i tried to draw or read or just listen to music i’d get this sinking, stabbing feeling in my stomach.... i don’t know what to do but i missing being able to do things.edit: oh geez this got a lot more responses then i was expecting. thank you! the comments make me feel a little better and seeing that i’m not the only one with these feeling is reassuring. i’ll try some of the things you guys suggested. thank you again!
does anyone feel like a shadow of their old self?
i’ve begun to depersonalize i’ve noticed. if you had known me 2 years ago you’d see a pretty stable and happy individual. i’m no high school teenager who listens to billie eillish or whatever the fuck her name is. i’m a grown man, or at least i’m supposed to be. 2 years ago i was a firefighter/emt and a phlebotomist and also cherished my time in the military thinking it made me the man i was. but instead i threw it all away to chase a stupid dream that failed and nothing i did or accomplished even feels like it happened. it doesn’t even feel like i did it. now i’m a glorified rent a cop working shit hours struggling with ptsd, depression and a body that’s getting further and further out of shape because honestly why do i care if i’m out of shape? every day is a struggle, i swear half the reason i even shower is just so my fiancé doesn’t know how bad my mental state really is. going to work gives me anxiety, waiting to go to work is even worse. i want to tell my command staff i need time off for my own mental health but being in a right to work state and carrying a firearm for a living they’d just fire my ass instead of having a liability in their eyes. i want to make it clear i have no intention of hurting myself or others, i just don’t have any intention of wanting to do anything to be honest. i’ve tried faking sick to get out of work, didn’t go as planned but needless to say i haven’t done that since high school. i’m broken and i need help i can’t get. i’m lost and i don’t know where to go. i just want to feel okay again. i want to be me again.
here is a cute panda stopping by to see how your doing.

i reached out for help and no one listened.
today i was on the sofa and i felt a crushing boot on my chest. i have been in a rut these past two weeks, the same kind i fall into from time to time where i simply shut down, and i reached out to my friend and he didn't want to listen. he was happy today and he felt like i was dampening his good mood as i began to talk. i couldn't bear it so i fell quiet and lied down. i listen and listen daily, to everyone and everything, i give advice and support, but today i was hurting and wished to share and he didn't want to listen. no one does so i'm usually okay with it. i like listening and being the receiver. but today was different. today i woke up with no wishes to step forward. i'm okay not sharing since my other friend is usually always busy and has her own close friends. my mom doesn't understand it so i can't tell her. my psychologist is absent due to an illness. today the boot crushed me till i cried, and i don't cry at all.i've fallen into the same rut i fall into after a good batch of productive weeks. where i fuck off and ruin my progress. no workout, eating too much, staying up late, watching garbage, no writing my book, no work done on my videos, procrastinating, numb, alone. feeling worthless. wishing for company. having none. where my self esteem dwindles every second as i type this at midnight when i should be sleeping. but nobody's listening, so its okay.
it really hurts when that one special person doesn't love you back

i just want to stay in my bed and cry
i don't want to do anything, i just want to stay in my bed and cry. i'm still eating which i guess is good but i'm spending so much money on deliveries because i can't be bothered to go grocery shopping or cook. i managed to fold some laundry yesterday but i couldn't bother to actually put it away so it's all neatly folded on the floor.i just want to be happy.i go out and lay down on the grass instead of my room get some sunshine but it just makes me sadder that everything is so beautiful and i'm not happy.i tried to hang out with friends but i don't have a good time, i wish i did but i just don't.i just want to be happy but i can't stop crying.
just a reminder to be kind to yourself

i've noticed depression has been blocking some blessings

starting to feel a little better

when things get bad you just have to ride the wave

depression....my coping mechanisims
## 49 yo male.......these are the top 10 things that have helped me cope with depression for the last 15 years. just thought i'd share them with you1. sleep: go to bed before 10pm. get 6-8 hours solid sleep if you can.2. exercise: walking, cycling, swimming. if you can, do them all and as often as you can. forget gyms, get out in the fresh air. get back to nature.3. medication: find the correct ad dosage and stay on it until your doctor says otherwise. no shame in taking medication.4. meditation: buy some good tapes and learn meditation and mindfullness. practice daily. i takes a while to get use to it so be patient.5. reduce external stressors: this is a hard one but if your job is way too stressful, change it or leave it. not easy i know but without your health, you've got nothing.6. stop living in the past: if you've made mistakes in the past which contribute to your condition, let them go. you will never be able to change what has already gone. forgive yourself, learn from those mistakes and perceived failures and move on. just try not to repeat any of them going forward.7. kick bad habits: if you take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol, stop now. these are non-negotiable for someone who suffers from depression.8. loneliness: this is by far the most difficult to address and is a huge problem in modern society. all i can say is if you have family and friends nearby, meet and talk with them often. they saved my life. if you can't do this and you feel like shit, at least try and ring a local help line.9. keep yourself clean and tidy: wash each day and put on some clean clothes. it'll make you feel better.10. remembering 1) - 9)remember, you are special and unique. there is only ever going to be one of you....ever.you can beat this.
if you are alone in your room right now, and you have some time to spare...
- open up your window just a bit, fresh air is good for you and your (mental) health.- go and get a glass of water, hydration does wonders- clean up your room a bit, it doesn’t have to be fast, do it at your own pace. a clean room eases your mind, and you did something productive- put on some calming, soothing music that you like- shower if you haven’t showered today, give yourself the whole spa treatment while you’re at it, hot showers are so relaxing for your body- spend some time on something you love to do, but haven’t done in a while- eat something healthy if it’s been a while that you ate something- if you’re still studying, catch up on the things you’ve seen in class, work on the assignments- try to avoid staring at screens right before going to bedthese are small actions that’ll get you in a more positive mindset and which will help you sleep better that night. this way you can wake up the following morning with a fresh start.depression isn’t something you can fix in a day but it is something you can absolutely start fixing today!i believe in you
my friend always says she's a bad person, so i leave her reminders like these that she's not.

does anyone else get hurt by what people say on reddit
i'm actually loosing my will to live by being on here. my real life also has its obsticals but then people criticize me even when i'm asking for advice on a topic.on a differnt sub, i asked about why people at work keep babysitting me. they replied cuz u arent as competent as u think u are. i know i'm good at my job. i just wanted advice. i'm already suicidal. maybe i dont deserve to live if i cant even do anything right. i do well in school and even though i use a site that helps me on homework for an non imp class. i work hard and i have been for years. i've made sacrifices and my health has suffered. and then someone comes along and destroys me.
thought i would share this

this is a post for all those who consider taking their own lives.
one week ago my little brother committed suicide. i am not going to tell you how, because i don't want anyone getting ideas and i also don't want to get too personal.he was in his early twenties, he had just started a new job he really liked, he had friends, he was dating, he had fun, he was enjoying life. at least that's what we thought, that's what it looked like. what no-one knew was that he had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years… the news not only about his sudden death but also about his illness has left his friends and family in a complete shock. our world has suddenly stopped turning and we have no idea how to deal with this. looking back you start seeing little signs, small things that could have indicated how he was really feeling, behind all his jokes, behind his laughter… not a day has gone by since he left us that i haven't cried until i was completely exhausted; that i haven't begged the universe to let me wake up from this nightmare and bring him back to me.we were extremely close and i often let him know how much he means to me and that i will always be there for him, but still… he felt alone. it was his depression that didn't allow him to see things the way they really were. and now it's too late. he can't go back, he doesn't get a second chance. we now know that he thought there was a tiny chance he might survive this, but he didn't. if you make that choice, it's final, there's no going back, not for you and not for the ones who love you.you may think you're alone and that nobody is going to miss you, but that is bullshit. it's your illness that makes you blind.so please, if you're considering suicide, think about all the pain your death will cause. there are people you can turn to, places you can go to that can help you. there is a way out of this suffering. i wish my brother had had a tiny bit of energy left to seek help. i know this world sucks, i really do. we have created a disgusting society that makes more and more people feel worthless, never good enough and right now i'm furious at the whole world. please don't bow to the sick ideals of today's society. you don't have to be 'sexy’, you don't have to have a certain weight or earn a certain amount of money. all you really have to do is make yourself happy, truly happy. reach out so someone. there is help and there are so many people who managed to come out of this and take back control over their lives.i wouldn't wish this kind of pain upon my worst enemy, so please don't do this to the ones who love you. i know that depression sometimes makes you think 'they will be happier without me’ - i can assure you, that is a lie. it's a lie your illness tells you to make you surrender. it wants to win and to do that you have to die. don't let it win. please stand up and fight. you don't have to fight alone, but please don't give up.edit: thank you all for your support, there's not really much i can say at the moment, but please know that your kind words are appreciated
feeling depressed so i painted this.

i hope it makes your day

i showered today.
i got up and went to work for two hours. came home and napped for three. sat on couch and watched netflix until my son came home. he’s made himself a snack and i’m totally useless. but i showered and brushed my teeth today too. i still feel like a failure.
you have more options than you think!

so you want to kill yourself tonight: a message
recently i’ve been reading posts from suicidal people who believe that they have just as much a right to a humane, chosen death as terminally ill people do. and i believe there may be a point where someone really is so emotionally broken and numb and darkened that suicide is the more humane choice—but the thing is, i’ve thought i’d reached that point before, and i came back. and i wanted to share some things that have helped me when i’ve been on the edge.i want to start off by saying that i fully accept the limits of this medium. i’m not gonna pretend that i love you or that i can say without a doubt that you’re a wonderful person. i know how much those empty platitudes like “you’re loved!” or “the world needs you!” can be to someone who’s contemplating suicide. we don’t know each other—i’m a stranger on the internet, no better than words on a screen. i have no stake in your life. but i know you *have* a life, i know that you’re a real person with hobbies and a sense of humour and pet peeves and a favourite colour, and knowing you’re a person who’s struggling is enough. i may not know you but i want you to live, and maybe it’s selfish because i see myself in everyone who’s suicidal and helping you is like helping myself, i don’t know. it doesn’t matter. when you’re suicidal, you can only really see the positive aspects of death—and i’m not denying there are some. yes, the pain will go away, and the numbness, and whatever guilt/sadness/anger cocktail your depression has given you. but there’s more to it than that. if you kill yourself now, all possibilities, every glimmer of hope and fulfilling path you haven’t discovered yet, it all ends. forever. and you will become a statistic. your individuality, your personality, the parts of yourself that still exist even when you’re struggling to keep your head above water, all that dies with you, and you become a body to be processed and tabulated, a tally on the suicide board, a number, one more person this thing has claimed. and people you can’t even conceive of now will be effected by your death—your pain will pass onto others in the form of guilt and grief. you will be perpetuating a cycle of pain. and you will have chosen to do it.there are less abstract reasons not to kill yourself. you may not succeed, and instead may be condemned to an existence much worse than your current one, namely one of grievous injury, disfigurement, lifelong medical issues. or if you do succeed, someone is going to find your body, and it won’t be dramatic and it won’t be poetic, it’ll be awful and traumatising. if you succeed, you’ll never be able to eat your favourite food again. the world will cease to exist. you will never sing or eat or smell or sleep again.live out of spite. or fear. or obligation. i am telling you, right now, that it doesn’t matter why you live, at least not in this moment. in this moment, what matters is that you live at all. the rest comes later. but you have to live to see it. and life is shitty, believe me i know. but as much as you might believe it, it’s not life that’s making you feel the way you feel right now—it’s that worm in your brain that does nothing but push you down, make you think you’re worthless, force you not to go to social events and then mock you for having no friends. i can’t stress enough that this is an illness, but it’s your choice whether it’s fatal.i’m writing this because i almost killed myself tonight. i’m writing this to myself as much as to you. two months ago i wound up in the hospital because of my near-suicide. i spent the night in a bright hallway while a schizophrenic homeless man moaned in the cot behind me and an addicted woman screamed for pain medicine in the room next to me. i heard an old man get a litre of his urine drained via catheter. that’s the hospital at 3am. they gave me a sedative and after a groggy talk with a crisis counsellor, i was discharged the next morning. i drove home and everything seemed imperceptibly changed, even the buildings i’d passed every day for months, and i went back to my room where the night before i had nearly downed enough barbiturates to seriously hurt me, and it didn’t feel the same. i wasn’t cured—i’ve had low points since then and there will be more in my future, same as yours. that’s how it goes. when you choose to be a survivor, you sign up for all of it.you learn who you are in these moments. you learn what keeps you going. and you learn that, at least for tonight, you’re not the person who pulls the trigger or takes the pills. you’re the one who survives.***if this post helped you, i’m grateful—but i didn’t do shit. you made the decision not to go through with it. and i’m fucking proud of you because nobody’s even going to know if you don’t tell them. you have come to the very brink of death and you have saved yourself, and in the morning you’ll wake up and keep carrying on. that’s how it goes. silent and powerful victories, and excruciating progress. the world is waiting for you.
anyone relates to my draw?

found this and it made me feel a tiny bit better. hope y'all get a laugh out of it at least

exactly

how are you? i'm fine

it’s been two years since, i’ll hate myself forever over this
i can’t just get over the humiliation that my parents made me call this guy that rejected me (for an arranged marriage, because he didn’t like how i looked) and convince him to reconsider his decision. i remember pleading with him for close to an hour. i just stupidly followed the instructions and my (already abysmal) self esteem saw new lows. and he rejected me again. it comes back to me every night, i can’t seem to forgive myself for doing that to myself
just a reminder
keep your head up guys, all will be well.try your best today, i know you can do it!have a good day everyone!
i think a lot of us need to do this more

after years of struggling with depression i've decided to make a difference
i'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. a little bit about me:a couple years ago i was starting to notice a change in myself. i was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. i started just not caring about anything. it wasn't until one time driving home thinking i couldn't really care if a car hit me and i didn't make it out alive. i realized at that moment that i wasn't my normal self. i still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so i thought with nothing popping up. then my mum died suddenly while i was home and i went off the deep end. everything crumbled around me and i didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. i had a blow up at my boss and that was it, i broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. it took time but i felt much better, i still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole i've picked up my life from where i was at.&#x200b;alright a little about my charity efforts:i got an amazing response from my friends and family when i decided to post it on facebook and i smashed my original goal of $500. i've still got a month to run on my fundraising so i'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.my fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am western australia time\- fundraising day at my sport club on 16/2/2020&#x200b;how can you help?\- checking out beyondblue and the work they do.\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)\- know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? please let me know as i would love to be able to do some giveaways \- if you are in western australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. i would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.\- just reading this post i hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.&#x200b;fundraising link [https://beyondblue-individual.everydayhero.com/au/david-s-beyond-blue-fundraiser?utm\_source=edh&utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=ind-event-reg&utm\_term=visitmypage&utm\_content=qrt2](https://beyondblue-individual.everydayhero.com/au/david-s-beyond-blue-fundraiser?utm_source=edh&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ind-event-reg&utm_term=visitmypage&utm_content=qrt2) twitch link [https://www.twitch.tv/vegavortexcn](https://www.twitch.tv/vegavortexcn) ;beyondblue website [https://www.beyondblue.org.au/](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/)
made another account for this
i'm in year 9 in britain (8th grade america) and i'm a girl. --- please take a couple of minutes to read this? it would mean so much to me if just one person could read this.about a week ago i finally had the medical appointment at cahms in the uk (child and adolescent mental health services) and i was talking to some guy about everything, and he asked me about if i ever felt suicidal - there was a huge silence and i stupidly went even farther than talking about my thoughts and told him that >!i had the rope ready, !<which has coincidentally disappeared from it's hiding place, i managed to keep one of my sharpener blades though. he invites my mum back in and asks her if she thinks there are any triggers to my self-harm, and i wish i was lying when i say the first thing she said in answer to that was she hurt herself because i took her phone away and i immediately try to explain about distractions, and how when it's the middle of the night and there's nothing to distract myself from all the pain with, it's either cut yourself or go that one step further. and the doctor tried to explain to her that it's not that simple. but here we were last night with my mum taking my phone at 8:30 pm sharp, because she knows best and she can't sleep knowing i'm on my phone but apparently can sleep when i'm cutting my arm to pieces.also. telling me to try not to focus on my emotions is a very helpful thing to say, seeing as i don't feel anything anymore. you might have known that maybe if when i tried to explain my suicidal thoughts to you you hadn't told me i was just using it as an excuse, to get what i want and to blackmail.i got diagnosed and prescribed 10mg of some medication that i've forgotten the name of, cause my mum won't even let me hold the box or get my own tablet out, cause i'll *probably* try to down all of them.  the worst part of all was the second he said the words it is clear to me you have clinical depression, and i think it's severe. and my vision went white, and i swear my heart stopped. too bad it started.
my gf has severe anxiety and depression stemming from a brain tumor, i want to learn ways to help talk her through attacks pls any advice is appreciated
my girlfriend is a beautiful soul who was dealt a bad hand. she has been faced with many tragedies and had a brain tumor when she was in high school that effected her fear and anxiety part of her brain. most days are good but she has days where she spirals out of control and talks about “what if’s”, such as what if i get sick again with a tumor. recently she has been saying she doesn’t even understand why she’s still here and why god let her live only to feel this way. i do my best to listen and give encouragement, but sometimes i feel lost for answers. my gf has very bright future she is about to start pa school which will come as a major challenge with stress and anxiety and i want to be able to help anyway i can. please reddit i appreciate any advice, i love this girl and hate to see her suffer like this.
in a great mood and i'm enjoying it

make your hope box
there is a thing called hope box. the hope box is a box where you put reasons to live. for example;    -old photos that make you happy   -poems that you like  - songs that make you more happy  and other things the hope box serves to give you hope, and happyness. i have one and always that i am thinking of suicide i open my hope box.
so i am a male diagnosed with major depression and bpd. this is a recent piece a drew to help other people see what it's like to live in my head. anyone else use art to help them cope?

i got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and i feel worthless
first time poster here. on mobile.i've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life i dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.this guy had been my rock for all those years. he experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.things weren't always perfect.i nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. overall i just wanted things to be better for him. to be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.this year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. for a very long time i told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. he never did and i saw him get worse and worse.i tried being the best support i could for him. it was only fair and obviously i did it because i loved him.on the november 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. i asked how it went and he said it went well.then on november 9th he asked to speak to me once i arrived home from being out of town. he arrived at my house after work. he begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. he mentioned that he never thought of us. which is fair because it had been rocky.he said he didn't love me anymore.he finished what he said and waited for me to reply. i was in shock. i didn't realize just how bad it was. it was like a curve ball was thrown at me. i didn't know because he never opened up to me even when i asked.he then proceeded to ask if i wanted to join him on trip which just took place this monday through wednesday. in that moment i got angry. how could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? it wasn't logical.we argued and towards the end he said he was done. i asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.fine.i let him be until he contact me on sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.we didn't end up meeting up on monday and did a follow up instead on tuesday.we talked. i was worried for him. i told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. he said that why did people care. he was so distant.before i left i asked again where we stood. and he told me to give some time. i asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.fast forward to this monday. he told me to have any false hope of getting together.we went on our trip and i noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. it was something i noticed right away. we moved on through the day. we got to our destination.  while laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. it was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. we went about our day. came back to our airbnb and as i was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.after our naps we went out to explore the town. had a couple drinks went back to our airbnb and ended up sleeping together.the day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. we eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.we ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. we decided to stay and just wait it out.during this time i noticed he was texting someone a lot. i read the name and realized it wasn't someone i was familiar with. i clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack i asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. he told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. i wasn't buying it. we went through the concert. went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the airbnb.i didn't want to be the fool so i did what needed to be done where i could get answers. i looked through his phone. sure enough, he was talking to someone else. i didn't know how to handle the situation but i knew i needed to make aware the other party of my presence. i told them who i was, how long i've known him, and the status we were in. i then added them on snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that i wasn't lying and that i wasn't just anyone.as soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. that if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.i ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since august.he wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.he decided he would be taking an uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. it didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.once we got closer i confronted him. i couldn't keep in what i was thinking and wanted to let him know what i felt. it sucked.he said he hadn't loved me for a while.that when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.through all this i couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.we argued the rest of the way home.at the exit to his apartment i made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. that triggered him. he went into a screaming rage in my face while i was driving on the highway. it was verbal abuse. i feared for my safety in that moment and so i pushed him back. that made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.i ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.since i still had the girl on snapchat i watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.and so now i'm just here. feeling worthless.i cared for himi loved him.but i didn't even recognize him anymore and all i ever wanted to do was help him feel better.he didn't even have a regard for me anymore. he didn't even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. and so i've been writing this since 5:23 am and now it's 6:29 am. i don't know how to feel. but i feel worthless.dit: during our argument he brought up that i had ruined our trip to seattle which happened the last of august of this year. i ended up taking 40mg of sativa which he said i would be fine. i then proceeded to trip out because of a bad joke. he started mocking me that obviously i had to fee bad. and i did start feeling bad because i couldn't control my mind and i was going suicidal. i told him that. but he still said you ruined my time that i could have been spending time with my friends.

i just don't have the energy to socialize with people
i'm so fucking tired. i'm tired of my job, my home life, myself. i'm so exhausted all the time that socializing with a group of people is way too much work and it's so fucking emotionally draining.it doesn't matter how much someone wants to hang out, i cannot and will not hang with them because it's so fucking miserable for me. i just don't feel the same enjoyment other people do during group hangouts. it feels like a chore. i feel nothing and everything all at once. how hard is it for someone to take the hint that someone else just isn't in the right mindset to be social???? it's so fucking difficult and not a lot of people understand that.
scribblings to lessen burden

loneliness is eating me alive.
my life is a mess and i have absolutely no one. i can't keep going.
my dog is getting put down tomorrow and i'm not able to comfort him.
my dog is getting put down tomorrow due to being aggressive. he but my brother's hand because the dog was in a fight with another dog and my brother got caught in the middle. oden is a sweet dog and i don't want him to be put down. i want the other dog gone. the other dog, atlas, is the reason for all of this. oden and atlas never got a long. they are always growling at each other. and not that oden is being put down, i am not going to be able to be in the same room as him because i have school. it's getting really tough because my dad, who oden is terrified of, is going to be taking him to the vet. i don't want him to die scared.
i did something!
for the past year i have been wanting to make a youtube video! and guess what?!?! i did it! today! it's a shitty video, not edited, and all over the place. but i did it and i'm proud of myself. i have had depression and anxiety for so long but today i'm tired of letting them hold me back. i'm holding myself accountable for all the shit i haven't done and i'm getting to it.
it's hard to be the strong one for your friends when you're going through your own issues.
i'm always the one my friends go to when they are going through something. don't get me wrong, i love being there for them but sometimes it gets so hard for me because i feel like i don't have anyone to go to now. they don't know that i'm going through some stuff and i don't want to burden them with it because they're going through issues of their own. it's just hard.
9 strategies for boosting motivation when you’re depressed
1. get out of bed and out of pajamas2. go for a walk3. get your hands dirty to get a mood lift4. don’t overschedule5. avoid negativity6. stick to a routine7. socialize8. create a support network9. get enough sleep
it's actually getting better!
i don't know if this is relevant to this subreddit, i'm just so excited i have to share this with someone.  i've been on a intense journey to recovery for the past month without really seeing progress. and when i say intense, i mean every second has been dedicated to getting better. but all of the steps i've took didn't actually make things better, but rather just prevented me from harming or killing myself. basically i've stayed in the sattle while still being terrorised. and it never felt worth it, until now! &#x200b;tonight i got 7 or 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep! and for the first time i genuinely believe there's hope for me.  sticking to recovery has been the hardest most un-gratifying thing i've done in my life. but i'm sticking to it! i'll still take all the small steps, and whatever it takes. and whenever i'll start to question it, i'll have this to look back at, and know it works, it just takes time and patience.  lots of love to the other fighters out there!
you are doing great
hey life is hard, but you have almost made it through 2019 that's really big!you have kept up the fight!this is something to be proud of, you have done really well :)))

skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? please help me, anyone.
hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and i'm going to not go through and re-read anything like i usually do as i know i would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isn't too confusing. it'll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but i need to at least get down all of what happened. just need some advice/support, or whatever please, i'm not really sure what i need, like i said, i'm not in the best state of mind currently.&#x200b;i've skipped school maybe 5-6 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and i don't even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. i've never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if i felt like it. these were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brothers/sister wouldn't be home, either at school or work. these are the days that i kept toying with the idea, feeling safe (in a weird way, i know) that i could kill myself if i needed to. i haven't skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday i was thinking as i get closer and closer to graduation, there's a time limit of sorts on when i'm actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer i feel more pressure that i have to do it, because i feel like i need to kill myself before i graduate high school, i'm not sure why. today i woke up at 6:30, and as soon as i got up i was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. i told my brother, who i normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that he'd better walk to school ahead of me if he didn't want to be late, so he left. i literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what i was going to do. then after that i just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 3-4 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that i had been too scared to look up before. found out the way i wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things i needed, but was so scared that i wanted to delay it somehow, even though i was still determined to go through with it. i told myself that i would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if i still wanted to kill myself, i'd do it after that. well when i woke up, i felt a little different, a little more hopeful, i'm honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. now i have to figure out what to do next. i had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. it just seems so so so overwhelming, like i can't deal with it and i don't even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if i can still take them, or what i tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him i wasn't there, or what to do about trying to manage this so i don't end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.i really, really, appreciate any help at all. feeling really lost right now. sorry for the long post. thanks for reading if you managed to get this far.

i don’t want to feel depressed anymore
i’ve been depressed for 8 years now, and long story short it’s really been getting the best of me these past 3 months. i don’t know why it’s all crashing down now. i’m tired of feeling like this, i say i want to die but in reality i just want to escape. i finally want to be better. i just don’t know how. therapy doesn’t seem to help, and i’m willing to try anything to feel better. every time i get to a good place mentally, something happens and i’m back to square one. i’m a mess i guess and just need help to get beyond this
can’t escape politics and it’s making me not want to exist
i’m so sick of hearing about politics. liberals and conservatives are constantly in these arrogant screaming matches over who is right, and it’s so pathetic that it’s drawing all the energy out of me.we’re destroying the earth and still have to argue whether or not this is a real issue.i’m trying to fight inside myself just to get through the day and go to work and be there for my family but underneath it all i have this deep seething depression that nothing i do matters and that humans are just slowly fostering more and more hate.i can’t handle it, and i feel powerless and i just don’t know how to get through this.edit: wow, thank you all so much for these replies. you all helped so much and i’m bookmarking this page to come back and read it when i start to feel down again. these replies inspired me to delete my facebook and twitter accounts, as they were only causing me anxiety. my dead end job often increases my depression but i’m going to look into volunteering to find something proactive to do in my city. thank you for reading my plea for help and for caring enough to respond. you all truly helped me and these replies will stay with me... i know my depression and darkness will come back, but i feel more equipped for coping.i feel heard, and i thank you.
really unmotivated to study and its messing up my life
finals is up around the corner but i am really not motivated to study at all. (i dont live in the states) i socialize with people really well and seems really optimistic when i'm outside especially with other people. however when i went home i just lost motivation to do anything when i think that exam is coming. i am doing decently well and definitely getting complacent, feeling that theres no need to study. this mindset is messing up my life as i lost motivation to do other things and end up browning the internet everyday.i feel like i need someone to keep me accountable but my family and friends just aren't able to do the job. is there anyway or platform for me to interact with people so that they will make sure i studies and be more motivated? i just feel like maybe a stranger online can make me better, i'm literally running out of choices. i don't want my life to be a mess. please help.
i am unemployed at the moment and i’m searching for a job. i can’t seem to get myself out of bed everyday because i am so depressed. i go to bed early and wake up late and can’t seem to move. i need help and i feel like something is seriously wrong with me.

i’m so scared i’m going to lose my wonderful partner because of my depressive moods and anxiety
i have days where i am happy, fun, sociable and we are so happy together. and then i have days where i’m angry, screaming, hurting myself and inconsolable. not once has he ever ever complained, he talks me through my panic attacks and my bad days and loves me and supports me. he is amazing but i’m scared he’s going to have enough one day. we are 24 and probably moving onto the next step of moving in/engagement in the next few years but i’m scared he’s not going to want this life forever and move on to a happy easy going girl. i need to change now before i push him away edit: thankyou so much to everyone who took the time to reply, especially those with long thought out messages. i have booked a counselling session this week and going to see my gp! also wanting to take on all the other bits of advice that i can start doing independently. my partner and i are both experiencing periods of depression so sharing this with him so we can help each other. much appreciated everyone, love this support all over the world. x 
dae feel dumber because of their depression?
i feel like i've gotten so much dumber since my depression got severe. i've always been a sort of high functioning depressive but it got really bad around two years ago. now i struggle with speech a lot and sometimes can't remember simple words or i'll say the wrong word that's not even a word. like the other day i was talking to a classmate and i said squibble instead of scribble. facepalm, i know. it was pretty dumb. i used to be so articulate. :( edit: thanks everyone for the responses and words of encouragement. feels great to know i'm not alone (not that i'm happy you are affected similarly but its comforting to know i'm not the only one). i don't want to be depressed anymore. if anyone is interested in being a sort of accountability buddy to encourage each other to be better, please pm me. i am trying to get out of my depression naturally since pills really affect my memory. anyone out there doing the same? let me know please. :) 
i paint when i’m sad

is it weird to thank someone for sharing with me about the fact that they have depression?
i don't want to throw the word depression in there, i thought about using a more neutral/positive term like disclose or trust me with their struggles.
i'm fucking done...
 i'm so fucking done. i want to just die already. i have autism and i  can't hold a fucking job. i can't support myself. 17 jobs in 5 years.  average stay at a job is 60 days. social security insists i am not  eligible to get help, but i can't hold down a job. i feel like the world  is telling me i am not welcome on this earth. i am tired of being a  pariah, a freak of nature. i didn't fucking choose to be born this  way. i am tired of being poor and destitute because i happened to be  born with a disability. i am tired of people constantly telling me it  will get better. it doesn't. the only way out of this torment i can see  left is to end it all.
how depression effects relationships

just a reminder for you.
you're worth it.   people out there love you.  look yourself in the mirror, and tell yourself that you are worth it.  any of us on this reddit will be there for you if you need a place to rant.
a couple of days ago, i drew this. after trying everything to fight against depression, i started to feel better. but out of nowhere, it came back, stronger than before. now i feel lost, emotionless and i now understand that this is not a battle, is a war that i don't think i'm winning this time.

i painted this earlier and in my eyes, it's what depression feels like.. the light is just slowly fading and melting into the darkness..

i cracked tonight, but it may save my marriage
i’m depressed. i’ve never admitted that to myself before. i’m anxious too. i am the type of person who thinks everything is shit. life is shit. nobody cares about me. i deserve nothing. unfortunately i can’t live like this without projecting it onto my family. my wife has had enough and is ready to walk. i’ve looked at myself, and after blowing up tonight, i’ll go and see a psychiatrist asap.i’ve never been an overly happy person, but i’ve always been a reasonably nice person. a caring person. the last few years have changed me. my wife died. suddenly and unexpectedly six years ago. she was pregnant and our unborn child went with her.this left me a single dad to my special four year old daughter. if i didn’t have her i’d be dead for sure. i just threw myself into fatherhood and that kept me busy. it probably also kept me from seeking and receiving the help and healing i needed. this is where the shit started. it lead to drink. i still drink. daily. that’s my medication. i don’t get drunk. but i’m tipsy everyday. when i’m in this state i get a little down, and a little nasty. i don’t want to say abusive, but i can shut down, and can throw some nasty comments, that kinda thing. three years ago i met a beautiful lady. i had no intention of dating or marrying again. i’m an introvert and a loner and quite happy on my own. this lady swept me off my feet and before i knew it we were married and she was pregnant.i am now the father of an amazing ten year old daughter, a sweet and feisty two year old boy, and husband to a beautiful and intelligent lady that loves me to bits.i have a good business that takes very little of my time so spend time with my family, cooking, gardening, swimming, going for walks. life is good, yeah? no. it sucks. i can’t control myself. i’ve attempted suicide. i’m breaking everything i have. i’ve alienated most people in my life.what the fuck is wrong with me. i’m sick. i need help. i’m going to get that help. urgently.  but it took me a long time to get here.
how do i (14 m) talk to my (typical indian) dad about seeing a therapist?
tl;dr at bottomhey guys. so, for context: i am a 14 y/o dude from india. i have a typical indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. we haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. i have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. i think i might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. so, with that in mind, here's what's i need help with:about a month ago, i tried talking to my dad about my cuts. i went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. i told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that i cut myself because of youtube (as it had rotten my brain). he told me that he would have listened to me and helped if i had gotten good grades (like, above 95%) but since i haven't gotten good grades (i have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. i couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. the first thing i said was insecurities, and he said i don't know the first thing about being insecure. then i said anxiety and he went on and on about how i have no anxiety and it's all just due to youtube. this went on and on and i just stopped speaking. like half an hour in, he told me that i should just take a knife and slice my wrists so i can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (this was pretty descriptive. he told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)after like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. now i don't know if i should believe him or not. anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:i want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where i live. the closest one is like 3 hours away. one of my closest friends lives in chandigarh (it's a big city) and i asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. his mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in fortis hospital. he told me about her and i was like well, so can i call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since i'm a minor i can't be diagnosed without parental consent. so this means that i will have to tell my dad that i need to see a therapist. he will ask me why and i will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?(ps: he gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say i'm wrong since i am younger and that i never listen to him.)tl;dr: i am a 14 y/o indian dude with a typical indian dad. our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. i want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. i need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and i have no idea how to approach my dad about this. we have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. (skim through the upper paragraphs because i might have left something out, i tend to do that)&#x200b;update: so while talking normally, i asked my dad what he would say if i asked him i wanted to see a therapist. he reminded me that i had already asked him and he said that since there are no child therapists in india, it wouldn't do me much good. also, he said that my issue is a lack of focus and confusion (and it is this confusion that led me to cut myself) and that since i do not have a psychological problem like depression, i can just meditate and go for walks and i'll be okay. the funny thing is, i was amused when he said that i don't have depression lol (hopefully it didn't show up on my face)also, i talked to him about why he had talked the way he did when i told him about my cuts. he said that he had a long and tiring day and when i told him he couldn't process what happened and got irritated (which is his kind of go-to emotion. mine is laughing). i know this doesn't excuse what he said, but it's at least a reason i can get behind. he also told me to talk to him about whatever is bothering me instead of a therapist, which i won't be doing&#x200b;update #2: here is the link to the letter i will be giving him. if you would like, you can go through it and let me know if i should change anything (names and stuff changed): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpqoxtylrbuwbocquaczyazntw835uzhb3qqufjyhz8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpqoxtylrbuwbocquaczyazntw835uzhb3qqufjyhz8/edit?usp=sharing)&#x200b;update #3: so my dad got me an appointment with the therapist i mentioned for tomorrow at 11 am. i'll be talking to her tomorrow and i guess i will give the final update when i come back home&#x200b;final update: so i went to see the therapist today. we talked for about an hour and in the end, she diagnosed me with mild depression, anxiety and bpd (borderline personality disorder). i have been given meds for mood stabilization and am on some sort of anxiety program. i'll be going to her once every week for at least 3-4 sessions and then once every 15 days. i'm pretty sure this will be the final update, but feel free to pm me. a big thank you to everyone as all of you helped me a lot!
too depressed to even do basic things
lately i’m too depressed to even have the energy to do basic things like shave, shower and get out of bed. i just feel very miserable. anyone know any solution to this? i’m already on antidepressants.
feels like depression has permanently fucked up my brain, what helps with brain fog?
back in school, i was super academic. now i’ve dropped out of uni and manage to fuck up things as simple as giving people the right change daily because my head is just a cloud of static. i’m no longer in the suicidal stage of depression, and i guess i’m feeling better than i was. but i can’t focus, and i feel incredibly dumb whenever i try to do something. my motivation is still pretty non-existent, and i end up anxious because things aren’t done and things are a mess, but too overwhelmed to do anything. what helps the brain recover from depression? what can i do to start improving the brain fog and lack of motivation? i want to be who i was before, but it seriously feels like my brain is permanently fucked.
i feel like i'm getting dumber and dumber as time goes on

my room has been like this for 2 months and i don’t know where to start

got out of bed and went to class!
spent the past few days in a hangover induced,  severe spiral inwards and downwards; today i resided to the fact it was a “stay in bed, i can’t face the world” day.  figured i’d just do some work for assignments from bed....i knew i wouldn’t. so forced myself to get up. and i’m currently at the bus stop on my way to class. it’s the little things. hey i just got my bus ride for free  yay. 
i hate this
i hate when i tell people how i feel they say don't be sad.. be happy.. u can't think that way... be more positive.. and stuff like that.... like it's that easy.. like i choose to be like this.. it's not easy to stop those thoughts... i don't have switch in head... i wish didn't hate myself... i wish i could turn it off... i know low self esteem is not attractive.. but i didn't choose it..  when they ask why i don't trust people or talk to people it's because of that...but if you have read this.. know that i know how you feel.. i know it's hard to fight your own mind...
i cleaned my room and showered to feel better.
recently, my room was a mess. my room always become messy when i neglect cleaning it and it gets really stinky and my bed looks weird. also, i can go a lot of days without showering, just because i had a bad day, or i just don’t feel like it.today, i decided to clean my room, and take a shower from the past few days and i’ve never felt any better. i hope that i can keep this up everyday instead of periodically. just a reminder, i know you can do it. you have the motivation. you’re a strong individual and trust me, being clean can make you feel good. 
my only pleasure in life is sleep, because we’re temporarily dead - please show me some direction in my life
fuck this life, why me, why us, why did we get dealt this shitty hand in life. i just want to be set free, all this pain to be over with once and for all and to find the love of my life.the past two years have been hell on earth for me, everything is so difficult and the fruits of life have already died for me because i’ve been trying to reach them for years!!!
any time i think about the future i'm overwhelmed with how much i don't want to be there
basically title. whenever i try to think about what's coming i get the sense of why bother staying alive. growing old working a job i hate. being alone all the time because i can't relate to people. i don't even want to look for a job because either i don't get the job and wasted my time, or i did and now i have to go work at something i hate or something i'm not good at. either way i lose. not only am i incredibly alone but i'm also incredibly bored. nothing has excited me for a long time. worst of all i don't see any of these facts changing regardless of what i do. at least making it to the end of college seemed doable but making another 50 years, 40 if i'm lucky? fuck that man.
does anyone else feel the urge to sabotage aspects of your life, so that people take you seriously?
i’ve contemplated taking up drinking, because i feel like people would understand me more if i did. the alcohol is something more tangible than my illusive feelings. i don’t drink or smoke, yet i struggle everyday. why? what’s wrong with me? why am i so weak and stupid?
high functioning depression
hi everyone, i've been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but i finally decided to post.i have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. i was diagnosed when i was 17 but since i started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when i open up about my depression. even when i talked about my ptsd from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me.i shower two times a day every day, i finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and i make sure i get near perfect grades on everything, i work 5-6 days a week, i'm a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else i panic. my anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive.i've had people who tell me my depression isn't real because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. when i talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts i was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. i felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. it ruins lives and there is no one size fits all depression.i just need support that my struggles are valid.
i found help!
i had been in an impossible rut for several decades. to be honest, i thought that's how the rest of my life was going to be. down and out no matter what. suicidal ideation, self harm, the works. i hit an extraordinary low and began reaching out all over the place for help. even more than usual. i was afraid of myself. in the midst of all this i met a psychiatrist. the rare kind who actually wanted to help instead of just giving me whatever drug i told them i needed. and that's where my leaf actually began to turn. see, everyone else always told me it was just treatment resistant depression and that was that. my new doctor took a look at my history (and played some pretty weird mind games with me) and came to a startling conclusion. i'm not depressed at all. well, at least not only depressed. i'm bipolar!! type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. that's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  believe me, i was not happy about the news at first: what the fuck do you mean i'm bipolar? have you not been listening to me this while time? the signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those i didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more. but how would i have known? everyone else just said i was depressed and a little weird. i never really questioned it. i'm on a pretty heavy mood stabilizer now and have been for a couple months. intrusive thoughts have dropped considerably and a ton more positive changes. things aren't perfect and they never will be but damn are they looking up!
been one whole year since the day i tried to kill myself and i’m happier than ever
i was fighting depression for 6 years with it getting exponentially worse. first it was just once every couple of months for a day or so all the way to i was lucky if i got half a week where i didn’t feel like shit in a month. i met someone who i opened up to, she convinced me to get help and i’ve been so much happier since. has it been easy? no of course not. the depression will always try to find ways to sneak in things to make your life worse like pushing people away from you, making you believe you are a burden on others, all that horrible shit. but it does get better, you just have to keep on going until it does. even the brightest sources of lights in our world like robin williams can be extinguished by this. today i am somewhat organized in college when i thought i would have died before i graduated from high school. i’m happy and life feels amazing again. sure sometimes there will be a part of me that misses the depression, but when i look back at how i was and how i am now, i know it’s all worth it. i know it’s worth it when my sister runs up and hugs me fighting tears saying “i’m so glad you are still here”sky williams did a video called “a message to the depressed” that helped me out a lot. depression is a raid boss. do not try to 1v1 it like i did. it does damage over time so be sure to have plenty of supports with you and always remember that asking for help is not a weakness, but a sign of wisdom and strength.
i just want a hug.
i'm 16, male, and i have no idea where i'm going.everyone around me wants to do something with their lives, they have their shit figured out, and they know where they want to go and what they want to do. i have no clue.i've taken test after test trying to figure out where i'm supposed to be, but nothing fits. all i want to do is sit down and rest. i spend 99% of my time doing *stuff*. i'm on a competitive rowing team, i'm a straight a student, and i'm finishing up my eagle scout rank. all of this work, and i feel like nothing is coming out of it. i feel empty.i have no idea what i want to do with my life. i feel lost. and that's only half of my issue. i just want to be hugged, i want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobody's there. i want to feel like i matter to someone other than my family, i want to share my life with someone. but i can't do that. not at this age. i'm just so mad about it, i feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but i know that would only make it worse.i'm just tired of the waiting. i wish time would move faster. i wish i could figure it all out. i wish i had someone to love.and i know it only gets worse. i can't see myself living past 20. i can't even visualize it. i'll be lucky if i get that far.thanks for listening, and have a nice day.edit: thank you so much to everyone who responded. it really means a lot to me that you random people would reach out to me and let me know it's all gonna be alright. you guys have helped me look at my situation a little bit differently, and though it'll be tough, i think i can make it. again, thank you all so much and i wish you the best on your own paths.
does anyone else experience an “itching soul” symptom?
when my anxiety and depression is really bad i have this strange sensation that i can’t quite describe. it’s like experiencing the emotional part of having an itch - though nothing actually itches, and nothing to scratch to relieve it. i call it an itchy soul. does anyone else know what i’m talking about?
i'm really fucking sad
i'm 22 m, it's christmas day evening i feel fucking miserable i want to sleep and not wake up. i realize it's pretty depressing for christmas but i feel i had to tell someone.
i feel like no one will take me seriously because i’m not suicidal.
a little backstory:i’m 16 years old and have clinical depression and gad (generalized anxiety disorder). i also might have ocd. both my parents have chronic illnesses that made high school difficult, so i put in a lot of work and graduated early. in this process i lost most of my friends and i now have nothing to do with my time. i was struggling when i was in school, but it was at least a distraction. now after several failed attempts at trying medications prescribed by my gp i’m waiting to see a psychiatrist for a med change. i’m also not in therapy anymore because my therapist left to join another field of work. i feel so helpless and alone and i anguish in the pain of my anxiety ridden mind every second of every day. but it’s like i’ve been put in limbo. just waiting for the next appointment, where they’ll refer me to someone else who i’ll have to wait another month to see.  all of this waiting is because i’m terrified of dying or getting hurt so i could never self harm or be suicidal. this makes people not see me as a priority. but i need help and i need it now. i feel like i lose my mind a little more everyday. i feel lost in self loathing and disappointment because i can never do what i want or need to do. and i’m so very exhausted. i lay awake at night scared of everything from inadvertently starting a fire and killing my family, to being killed by a home intruder. i can’t take it anymore but still i have to wait just because i’m not “a threat to myself or others”. anyone else feel the same? cause i feel like i’m alone on this.
depression is not a facebook feeling word
i am worried that some people are using confusing the feeling word “depressed” because they’ve had bad couple of weeks with the actual illness depression ?
emotional eating
i noticed that over the past 2 years i’ve gained a lot of weight from eating my feelings. it’s like i go to food as a coping mechanism for when i feel bad. i was wondering if anyone had any solutions to emotional eating.
i absolutely despise myself. how do i not?
 i'm terrible at everything i try. everything i want to be good at i fuck up. i can barely cope with my (fantastic) job. i have absolutely no luck with women and am incredibly, insanely lonely as a result. i can't do anything i want to do because i know it won't be good enough.how do i \[30m\] not feel this way? how do i not compare myself to others? how do i be good at things that i want to be good at? how do i not hate myself? this is all i've ever known.
the wave of emotions that come with mental health issues

i feel like this stage of i guess i'll just have to power through it has been going on my entire life. life doesn't feel worth living if i'm constantly having to work to get through it.
i have suffered from anxiety/depression my entire life. my depression has gotten so bad the past couple years. i lost every single one of my friends, no longer have the support of certain family members, my co-workers hate me, and my physical health is lacking. i don't drive, still live with parents, and only work 4hour shifts 4 days a week. i'm in my early 20s.since february of this year, i have been so fixated on the idea of taking my own life, but i know that i'm just getting my hopes up with the idea of having some kind of control, i would never be able to go through with doing it as i'm afraid of the pain.i started seeing my old therapist again a couple months ago, and though it is nice to have someone to talk to that will give me advice, i feel that i'm just a lost cause. i understand therapy is a slow process but i am descending faster than i ever have before. i told him i was open to getting on medication, i was supposed to see a psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and be prescribed medication but my mom refuses to take me. she thinks that giving me some of her anxiety medication would work but i've tried it before back in hs and it just made me gain weight and feel like more of a piece of shit.so all i can do now is wallow in my own self-pity and loneliness until i waste away into nothing or finally grow the ladyballs and take my life. i'm tired of telling myself that i'm just gonna have to power through it because i have been trying to power through this lowest pit of depression i've ever been in for over 2 years and nothing has worked. weed is only a temporary release and it's always 50/50 on whether or not it'll make me feel even worse when i'm high plus it slows me down and has been making me more depressed long-term. i went through a sexual phase because any kind of affection made me feel better for a little while, now everyone knows me as an ugly sad hoe.i don't even know why i typed all this out. i'm just done, honestly. i'm done trying. i shouldn't have to struggle just to wake up every day.

small victories

fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can i enjoy life again?
i've been struggling with depression for +10 years, and i'm at a point where i'm ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore. i've always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether it's gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random yt videos. now, i feel like i would just be happier if i could live in that escapism all the time. if there was a way i could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, i would.even my therapist has acknowledged that life won't be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so what's the point? so far, the main answer seems to be you just have to do it. i don't wanna die, but i don't wanna live either. i'm convinced nothing would make me happier than if i were to live in my own head.edit: i’m also on the autism spectrum, so i’ve always had a harder time making friends, and interacting with people.
why can't depression ever be gone forever?
hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. i just joined and it's  my first time talking about such stuff online. i've been diagnosed  with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. up until now i've  been strong enough to overcome those small situations. and even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever i'm sort of reverting back to it. like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i don't leave space to thinking, i don't/can't sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize i've done them. and i like  reading but it becomes hard like i can't focus and i end up skipping lines or read without remembering/understanding what i just read. the more i stay home the harder it is to get out. anyway that's how i know shit is getting serious. other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. i have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. it's  5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when it's  far from its litter. the past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. i barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. but a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because that's  what he does .. whatever he likes basically. anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again. i got mad. and i couldn't get angry at anyone. i felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. and i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. i mean i know it's a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldn't  stop laughing for a while. i guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldn't  stop crying. and when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasn't  feeling well but i didn't think id react that way now. i thought everything was fine. now i just don't know if i really am. the only reason i can think of as the source is that i'll be taking classes again after almost a year now i've failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression  was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool  i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. i don't  know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging  person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. after that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. i'm  afraid that's  the cause but i don't  want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. this thing is already going on for too long. i'm  not sure what i'm  asking you here. but i guess i want an opinion or advice. i'm worried i can't tell when i'm  not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively  and i'll  only be aware of it when it's  too late. anyway.. thanks for reading until the end i appreciate it.
you guys make me feel less alone
i know it may seem pathetic and there are so many other people like me on here but reading your guys posts i see that everyone else’s life is just as struggling as mine. i suffer from social anxiety and i’m bipolar. i’m quite young and i haven’t experienced much but all my life i’ve felt different. i’ve been picked on, looked at differently, and talked about. i have a couple of close friends but even then they make me feel bad about myself. i’m so used to it by now since it’s been happening all my life so it’s easy to just brush off. i just take everything in and ignore it and it works but sometimes it catches up to me. looking here i realize that i’m not alone in my struggle so thank you guys for making me feel connected.
i tried posting on r/depression, but i soon realized that was the worst place to go. i deleted my post and came here instead.
this is probably gonna be all over the place. i haven't been diagnosed with depression by a professional because i'm too terrified to tell my parents, but all the hallmark symptoms are there. general sadness, loss of interest, unmotivated, always tired, self-loathing, urges to self-harm, etc. &#x200b;i'm 16, homeschooled (somehow managed to get incredibly behind, which adds to the depression), and i have no friends irl. i have online friends, and i trust them with just about anything. i've been half-tempted to give my address to one of them incase i end up doing something uh...rash, if you know what i mean. but anyways, they're good friends at heart, but a majority of them are absolutely awful at helping. i don't blame them. this isn't something you can just slap a band-aid over. most of the time they'd end up arguing, going something like:  tim needs this  no, he needs this insteadthat wont help  you don't know that&#x200b;i eventually just...shut down for a few weeks. i didn't talk to anyone, i didn't interact with anyone, i was offline on multiple places. this caused my friends to get worried, and a few of them started some discord intervention group chat thing. i only know about it because one of my friends there actually understood what i meant, what i was talking about, etc. so he joined just to tell me what was going on. it ended up being an argument between two of my friends over what way to best help me. despite the fact i told them about 40 times that i just wanna be listened to. now, this was months ago, but it still frustrates me somehow. &#x200b;i know i should tell my parents, i know i should get up and do something, i know it doesn't magically get better, but this immense amount of fear and anxiety prevents me from doing so. it doesn't help that my family constantly makes half-serious remarks such as: &#x200b;tim you're no fun, tim, stop being boring, tim just hates fun, etc. but they wonder why i don't wanna be around them. its frustrating. every time i try to do something, it seems to do absolutely nothing, or i just end up failing. i've tried getting out more, spending less time on my pc, etc. but at this point the only thing that could maybe help is a therapist, and i'm too terrified to say anything. at this point, theres only three things keeping me from jumping off a nearby bridge:   1. christianity. say what you want, i don't care, but its one of the few things keeping me alive.2. my friends. 3. causing my family the same pain i have. &#x200b;its infuriating knowing what i should do but being too scared to do it. my step-dad yells even when he doesn't mean to, he starts arguments over almost nothing, he can be sensitive, he's the biggest hypocrite i know, but at his core, he's a good person. my mom is too over-protective, she gets too worried and too panicky over everything. before they let me move my pc to my room, any time i laughed anything, my mom would ask what are you laughing at, what are you playing, etc. shes paranoid. and i don't like the idea of telling her about depression because of it. my step-dad is more relaxed when it comes to issues like this, but i'm afraid he'll just tell my mom, and i can't trust my siblings either. they'd all go to my parents despite what i say. i'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.   my brain is always foggy, i can never think straight. i feel like i locked myself in my own brain. i don't like being edgy or depressing all the time but i can't help it anymore. my friends get worried if i make too many depression or suicide jokes. i'm getting sick and tired of waking up to self hatred, tiredness, and general sadness. i'm frustrated. i've been like this a full year already and i see that number increasing unless i either kill myself or actually get help. it doesn't matter how well my day goes or how bad it goes, i still hate myself and end up almost breaking down at the end of the day regardless. i'm just lucky i don't think i'm ugly i guess. i hate everything else about me, but my looks? nah thats fine. apparently. &#x200b;tl;dr big sad sucks. thanks to anyone who bothers reading this
i told my husband that i’m not okay
i’ve been having some really low moments lately and had a talk with my husband about some of it. he was really supportive when i said the words “ i am not okay”. he said he’d do everything he can to help , but made me promise i will try to get professional help as well. later i apologized for losing it, and he said in all seriousness, to never apologize for that. he’s so good to me. i wish i could be whole for him. he’s my rock.
massive weight off my shoulders - opening up about suicidal thoughts
24f here :)disclaimer i'm not the most coherent person and i tend to ramble. not sure if this fits in this sub i also posted to r/anxietydepression)  so i've suffered with crippling anxiety since the age of 12 when my dad passed in quite a traumatic way for me. i've been through therapy/on meds for years and about a year ago i was feeling much less depressed and anxious and came off my meds yay!! a few months ago, i lost my job and it was a massive blow to my confidence. ive slipped back into a depression and never want to leave the house and am constantly arguing with my boyfriend (massive social butterfly) because i don't want anyone at the house and i just lock myself in the bathroom and cry all the time. obviously arguing has been making it worse as i feel like i'm losing him aswell as my mind.hes very kind but generally not the most sympathetic as he leads a very fast paced life and has been through a hell of a lot and his way to deal with his issues is the opposite to me lol.the past month my heads been full of suicidal thoughts, i think about killing myself most of the day, every day. like even if we are sitting watching tv i'll be looking round the room planning ways i could do it (even though i probably wouldn't). last night my boyfriend got really frustrated with me because he noticed i'd been self harming (when i do this i don't usually even remember it really and am always so embarrassed by it as soon as i realise-do other people get this??) and i shouted something about how i just wanted to die but i just couldn't leave him on his own and he looked absolutely heartbroken just cuddled me for ages. we had an amazing talk and he was the first person i've ever told about being suicidal (not even my therapist). i feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders and i can't stop crying, even now (in a good way) and i wish i had said something so much sooner. i also not believe that someone can love me unconditionally for who i am and that's really special. our relationship already feels so much more back on track and even though i'm still sad, i really feel like i've accomplished something and feel very blessed to have such an amazing man in my life.i guess i don't have too much of a point here. i just feel like i've really accomplished something and made a massive step in both my mental health and my relationship and wanted to share with someone. :)
was having a day and thought i’d share, this song always makes me feel a little better, maybe it can help someone else too

55 seconds of living with depression

dancing depression away: how to stop feeling depressed a fun way:]

i cant stop thinking about killing myself
i cant stop thinking about either blowing my head off or crashing my car into traffic. i don’t think i’ll actually do it since i have have think of my family dealing with it but i can’t get these thoughts out of my head, they won’t go away it’s literally 24hrs a day , the anxiety is crippling, i feel alone and unwanted & i try to hard to be normal but sometimes i break and people reject me. i have to always pretend to be strong for my family since they rely on me so much but it hurts to feel this way all the time
something a lot of you don’t get told very often
something a lot of you don’t get told very often:i love you. and i do. i love every single one of you. yes i may not know any of y’all but i still love each and every one of you. you know why? because you are all beautiful and wonderful people. you may feel like nobody cares about you but that isn’t true whatsoever. you’ve helped me immensely. if y’all weren’t here some off us would be worse off than we are now. you may not see the will in fighting or pushing on. but i’m telling you, there will be something in your future that will push everything away. i believe in you. so i want you to believe and love yourself. because if a random person off the internet can love you, you can love yourself as well.
to whoever needs to hear this: it will get better!
about a year ago, i was feeling  very down. i've struggled with depression for most of my adult life. i posted a depressive post here and got a few replies from people trying to cheer me up which didnt do much. however, things did eventually start getting better. some by chance others by decision. if you are feeling low. trust the process and life cycles of ups and downs. it's not always your fault but you do have a choice in your future. as humans we are fine tuned machines but things can get out of line in our brains or our surroundings causing depression. its important to keep going forward even if its just baby steps or taking breaks when necessary. learn to practice self love.
am i the only one who gets more depressed in the summer?
i've always suffered from depression regardless of the seasons, and i know most people's depression seems to worsen during the winter months, but for some reason, for me it's the opposite. i get so depressed in the summer, i don't know what it is...maybe seeing everyone out enjoying themselves just makes my own inner misery that much darker. today's the first day of summer and i'm just dreading making it through :( i realize how weird this probably sounds
was so deep in the dumps today that i had to write this to keep me away from anything that i could hurt myself with

does anyone else 'self harm' with music?
sorry for the title, i don't mean to trigger anyone with the terms i used, but i feel it kinda fits with my behaviour and the reasoning..&#x200b;i have a long list of artists i can't listen to because they make me irrationally emotional, but once a month or so, i'll crack out the sad tunes and basically, purposefully let the music kill me internally. it's like i want to be overwhelmed with sadness and this is the easiest way to do it without the obvious actual self harming techniques.its like.... once i've had the massive cry and release of emotion, i'm halfway back to being me again.&#x200b;edit: thanks so much for the replies everyone. its really nice to know this is actually something that seems reasonably common! if anyone is interested some of the tracks i listen to for the tears:dermot kennedy - gloryof monsters and men - i of the stormjessie j - who you arebecalmed (sea of thieves shanty) lol
i think i’m finally going to get help.

how in the actual heck does one love themselves
i have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that i receive love from other people (a potential girlfriend). this is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. problem is, that is all i know about how to love myself. i have been told to love myself but i find that very difficult to do. i was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. she took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. the difference is, that unlike her, i have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. a lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. i cant love myself, because the only two things i feel for myself are hatred and rage, so i look to unspoiled minds for affection. i know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, i know that. &#x200b;i am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. the only advice i have received so far is    that, you should love yourself. great, what the heck does that mean? i have received advice like, engage in your hobbies and court yourself. well i already have hobbies and i do nice things every once and a while, no effect there. plus, i don't have much time to engage in hobbies since i am a college student and despite having some money in the bank, i need to make more this summer. &#x200b;if you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.
i've been thinking about dying, not suicide, but finding another way to just die.
hi, my name is danielk, i will give you a quick summary of what's been going on.a couple of years ago i was married and with a child, long story short, my wife was cheating with one of my best friends at the time, i found out that my daughter was his, and i went through depression as best as i possibly could, never had therapy of any sort though.back then i thought of killing myself, but never got the courage to do so.fast forward to january this year, i broke up with my girlfriend after three years of relationship, it wasn't anything messy, it was mostly that both of us are busy ( we are both working and in college) and decided it was best for us to split at the moment, we broke up in good terms.yet for the past few weeks i've been feeling really down, i don't eat much, i can barely sleep, and the thought of just dying has been in my mind constantly. i'm having a hard time understanding myself, this isn't even close to what happened before, but somehow, i feel the same or even worse. i don't want to kill myself, just die, like getting mugged or ran over by a bus or something. i've been engaging in dangerous practices, i walk out at night on shitty neighborhoods looking for something to happen, i just don't think i have energy to do anything anymore.any advice? i feel this might be some strange case of ptsd, i dunno, i'm open to suggestions, and i am already looking for a therapist.thanks for your taking your time to read.
pushing through
hello,after 2.5 days in bed, scared to get out from under the quilt, i got up yesterday. i had a package delivered - 80 plug plants i ordered weeks ago. i really didn't want to but i made myself get up and plant those little feckers. i knew that leaving them in a box in my kitchen would have justified my usual brain set - look, they've died, what a stupid idea to get them in the first place, throw them away, everything is spoiled, metaphor for my life.... i spent two hours planting them in tubs and pots. who knows if all of them will survive? who knows what they will look like if they do? (i've no idea what they are, lucky dip purchase) what i do know is that i'm glad they are done, i'm glad i got out of bed, i'm glad i didn't let them die. if any survive and actually flower i'll post a picture to show that a little bit of effort makes a difference later! i don't care if a small, insignificant thing like this is something millions of people do every day. it's big for me. be ok everyone, plant something!

i have no ambition to do anything besides sleep, watch tv, & go to work
for the past several years i haven’t had any ambition to do anything besides basic things to keep me alive. i have no desire to clean my house, do any yard work, find a new hobby, etc. i make sure my dishes & clothes are clean but that’s about it. and i mow my lawn once a week but don’t do any landscaping. i keep telling myself i should work out, start writing, get crafty but instead just continue to watch netflix. has anyone found any way to get off their butt & focus on something? any specific med that might help me get started? i should also mention that i work overnights but i feel this problem started before my sleep schedule got all turned upside down. and even if it was related to sleeping during the day, i’ve been working nights for seven years, wouldn’t my body adapt by now?

low energy things that can boost your mood
i thought it'd be nice to post some non-strenuous things that keep me going when i'm feeling really down. idk about anyone else but i find sometimes that doing or achieving something small can give me a boost to do harder things like laundry, showering, cleaning etc. comment your own!- changing an item of clothing like socks, underwear, t shirt etc- washing my face or brushing my teeth- flicking through a non fiction book and reading the captions on the pictures- feeding my goldfish (her name is debbie ocean and i love her dearly) - free line doodling - draw a continuous line and try to fill up the page- sorting out your wallet/purse (it's so satisfying when it's flat again) - making a drink that's a little bit more effort than just tap water, like cordial, milkshake, or even just putting ice in a cold drink - emptying a waste paper basket into the outside bins- watching an episode of a show you like but haven't watched in a long time (be careful not to binge though)- messaging a friend an inside joke- finding something sortable and sorting it like stacks of coins, mail etc - for me it's my scarves- cleaning your glasses/phone properly 
you wake up and spend 12 hours getting ready for the day, working, doing chores, etc. all so at the end of the day you can spend a measly 2 hours doing something you enjoy. why?
i just don't get it and it's driving me nuts. the only reason i stick around is cause i feel too guilty killing myself, what with the few (and i mean few) loved ones i have. i mean, if there were a video game that was only enjoyable 20% of the time, and the other 80% it made you do work, would you play it? would it be worth it to you? of course not.&#x200b;so can someone please tell me what makes it so different from life? i asked over on another subreddit and couldn't understand why any of them do it. is anyone actually happy? do the majority of people enjoy sitting in an office selling paper, as if they'd do it for free? i feel like they don't. is this feeling i have truly a cause of depression? or am i right? **can someone please tell me why i'm wrong?**
boyfriend asked me to design a logo for his imaginary 70s sitcom and he has no idea how it helped me when i was having the worst day.

i finally told someone. and now i just feel worse.
yesterday night i was texting a friend (i had a few drinks) and ended up telling him about my dark thoughts. i don’t even know him that well, but at the time it was so easy. he was real kind and nice about it, and reassured me it was good to talk. but waking up today i just felt worse. i haven’t gotten out of bed and we’re well into the afternoon. i texted today, but no response. maybe it was all a mistake. maybe i shouldn’t burden people with my problems. i’ve always kept em to myself, why not now?
enjoy the good times 

i almost died a year ago and now i’m about to graduate year early and go to college
march 26 2018 i was diagnosed with mdd aka major depressive disorder aka clinical depression. i was in student government, ap classes, had a awesome group of friends, and just came back from state for deca. this diagnose came after me starting to skip school and not wanting to get up in the morning. naturally i started therapy and would go once a week during lunch. april rolled around and my depression was progressively getting worse. it all came to a head when i wasn’t allowed to run for student government next year and that night, april 18th 2018 i overdosed on several different medications that belonged to my 89 year old great grandfather and mixed it with nyquil. i laid backed and closed my eyes hoping to die in my sleep but then i had a dream where i died and everyone i knew wasn’t the same next thing i know i wake up in a hospital with my great-grandfather wiping his tears away and i knew what the universe was trying to tell me. so eventually i continue therapy and fail second semester of sophomore year because i knew school wasn’t for me. i spend the summer with friends and try and get back into the grove of things. fast forward to october and for deca there was a fall conference that i was really excited to go to and i knew would help put me on track. i was denied because my “penmanship showed i didn’t care.” i again felt so defeated and started skipping school. my friends wouldn’t try and be understanding this time and told me to get my shit together and drop me. my grades where dropping and i was just feeling like killing myself again. this time around i knew better so i started to have sex, drink, smoke, party to distract myself from the pain. i got stuck on a island (i live on the west side of wa), would come home @3am a lot, sneak guys who were 18+ and i was 16 at the time and would overall put myself into a lot of danger. during this rebellion i found this app called yubo and for the next few months i made some amazing friends, got into a lot of drama, and this helped meet my social needs to a certain extent. also during this time i switched to online school. i eventually was banned off yubo because of “threatening behavior.” but the app is trash and toxic and only gave me a small group of people that i still talk to to this day. all of my “problems” seemed to go away once i deleted the app and the day after my 17th birthday i got myself a puppy. now i’m going back to my seasonal job at nordstrom and i’m only a few credits away from graduating high school a year early. i started off on the top, hit rock bottom twice, but with the help of therapy, support, prozac, and honestly going through a rebellious stage i’m in a happy place in my life and it is all thanks to my ex-friends, and the two teachers who hated me for putting me on a path that will lead me to making 6 figures a year by the time in my mid 20’s debt free while they all are dealing with crippling debt<3. just remember you have to start somewhere. this journey is gonna have some set backs, a lot of bumps in the road, but you will figure this out and be happy! i promise
happiness only takes a few minutes a day

admitted to myself today thay i need help
tried searching for a therapist online today but couldn't find anything locally and broke down. i have been struggling with depression my whole life but always set my feelings aside for the sake of my family... or self medicated with alcohol and weed. i recently found out that i am pregnant and stopped smoking cigs, weed and drinking... i live 2 hours away from my family and i just feel so hopeless... my significant other has been great with everything since we found out about the baby, doing everything around the house, feeding me... i can't find joy in anything anymore and i don't know what to do... i can't even get out of bed or off the couch unless it's for work. i have my first appointment with my ob tomorrow so i plan on talking with her about how i feel as long as i don't chicken out... i guess i just needed to get this all off my chest to someone who wasn't going to judge me.  it felt good just typing this out as i have never admitted this to myself seriously before. thank you for listening.update: thank you all for your kindness, advice and support. i almost deleted my post after i typed it, but i am so relieved that i didn't. i have a habit of hiding my feelings, so it was difficult to even share this about myself anonymously. your support and validation gives me hope ♡.

my mother just told me she's depressed
this morning, my mother finally told me why she hasn't been working in the past two months and half. she suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her. i told her she should see a psychiatrist about that, and she responded that she is already seeing one and that she's taking meds to help her. she said she wanted to tell me because she knew i was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months. indeed, i was thinking that something was horribly wrong and she was dying or something like that. i am 18 years old and i dealt with depression last year. i didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that i was depressed. anyway, with proper medication, i overcame it and got much better, but i spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. her father died last week. my parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that i come because i have school. merely writing this, as his grandson, brings tears to my eyes. i've spent most of my days and nights since his death crying, but i cannot imagine how my mom feels. i haven't seen her cry, but it would be extremely typical of her to hide her woe if she thought that it would pain me to see her suffer.i suspect she's at the lowest point of her life, having to deal with clinical depression and then the death of her father, but i don't know how to help her get through this, which is why i need advice.
things are finally starting to look up
i finally took the plunge and i'm now on meds. escitalopram to be exact. this is the best decision i ever could have made! if this is what it feels like to be normal, then i like normal. i'm not crying every night and i actually got out of bed this morning. i feel level. kind of like a calm lake instead of my normal raging sea. it feels so good just to be balanced and able to function without a grey cloud sapping my emotions and making me unable to do anything. i can see light at the end of the tunnel and i'm enjoying finally feeling okay. i have had depression since i was about 8 and i became suicidal at age 10. after all these years, i am finally starting to be okay again. sorry for the long post, i just felt like i had to share with someone who would understand. i know meds aren't for everyone and i'm in no way trying to push them on you guys, but they have helped me so much and i finally feel at peace.
i’m a depressed and lazy 14 year old who has done nothing in his life. i want to change but i don’t know how. i see people accomplishing many things at a young age, while i’m not doing anything. any suggestions?

many do not know anne frank suffered from depression! yet she also inspired millions with her words!

my mom told me i ruined the day
i wasn't planning to feel depressed today mom. i'm so sorry that it inconvenienced you.
i have been flossing my teeth every day!
i have some sort of mental block with brushing my teeth and flossing afterwards. my therapist says that self-care is difficult because you don't believe you are worth looking after, so you don't invest in yourself. it is hard to stand still and stare at myself for those minutes, but i have been doing it!
to those who are suffering today
to those who are suffering today, suffered yesterday,  or fear they suffer in the future: you matter.  your life is important and needed, even when it doesn't seem like it.  you are a beautifully complicated creature with depth and perception that matches that of the deepest ocean.  you are once of the soldiers, strong enough to fight the good fight. you are loved and you matter.

are you honest with your friends about your depression?
i’m a 28yo f, and i have severe depression since 2012. my crisis unfortunately occur quite regularly (once an year or once every 1 and a half year). but since my first crisis i told me friend that i wouldn’t give them attention, i wouldn’t go out with them, i would avoid social media and texting. i explained everything the best i could, how i felt, how hard it was to keep contact and how it felt like a task/burden during my crisis. that maybe during the crisis i would need their help and it would seem selfish being absent for long periods os time and appear to ask for help without asking  about them. but it is what i can offer at the moment, and that when i’m out of a crisis i would treat our friendship normally again. did i lose any friends? sure, but it’s the life, some people can’t deal with this, but a lot of people can... you would be really surprised. i have a lot of friends for my age. 4 friends that i know that would do anything for me, even take me to their home if i end up homeless. with them i can share about the ugliest parts of my depression if i want to... i also told them that it’s ok for them to not know what to say or how to help when i tell them the ugly stuff,  i go to a psychologist every week and she can help me with that. i just tell them those things when i feel like i need to vent and i’m ok with them only answering in the lines of  “shit, this is tough. let me know if i can do something to help.”and i also have other friends that are super ok with me being absent from time to time, and when i’m on those periods of non crisis i talk to them by text and even see them occasionally to talk and have fun, and it seems like nothing have changed on our friendship. i’m very lucky to have them, but i know that this is due to the fact that i was honest with each one of them and i asked them for comprehension. some of them just disappeared from my life with time, but i made other friends and those who i kept are really understanding and supportive. so i guess this is a tip for those of you who don’t know how to handle friends during your lows. instead of disappearing without a warning and being embarrassed to contact them later, or making yourself present on their lives and, consequently, being rude or down in your interactions (which makes them not wanting to be your friend on the long run). be honest and don’t be ashamed to ask what you need. it is a disease, and unfortunately it is a chronic one for most of us. so don’t apologize for taking care of yourself the best you can, even if you have to disappear from time to time to do that. the right friends will help you with that. another tip: don’t waste your time with acquaintances. you need to have a good relationship with the people that is part of your daily life, like relatives, colleagues, friend of a friend. so be polite and helpful whenever you can. but don’t put your energy and mind on those relationships. you already have so little of it. you should use it to the things that are important to you.do you need to go to a party from a colleague from work or go out to look for s gift to s baby shower for a distant relative? do you have to call all your relatives on their birthday and go out of your way to do a favor to your friend’s friend that you see sometimes and chat with them socially on those occasions?  hell no, you don’t have to do any of that. saying “no” while being polite it’s totally ok, and should be done by everyone, not just us. if the person gets upset because they feel entitled to your time/money/effort, to hell with them. who cares? they are not important enough to be more than acquaintances anyway, and if they say shit to others about you, the important people in your life already know your situation and won’t listen to their comments. i hope these tips can help someone.
dae feel like they don’t really want the future anymore?
i had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how i’m going to be applying for top universities and how i could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if i’m one of the top performers which i could be, and how i need to consider the amount of debt i’ll be in from it when i get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. i just... don’t feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. i don’t even care about the debt, i can’t see myself ever buying a house and i can’t even bring myself to imagine having a s/o and kid’s. all i want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... i don’t know when this even happened. i was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and i’m studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars. everything i’m doing points towards having a successful future but i don’t think i really care anymore.
a survival story for anyone who wants to hear it 
i’ve been depressed since about age ten. the initial symptoms were nothing concerning considering i was starting to become a pubescent teenager; tired all the time, isolating, i started loosing friends, no suicidal thoughts yet but it was in the making. my family moved to colorado and i had no real friends for two years. i made one good friend in seventh grade who later tried to bully me. my dad got more violent and angry as time went on. i dropped off the cliff around eighth grade. i remember crying late at night because i couldn’t fall asleep or didn’t want to and have to face the next day so soon. my parents, or rather my mom i should say, noticed and tried to help the way she knew how. i told her i was depressed, and she thought i’d meant a little melancholy. it wasn’t until a year and a half later that she figured out what’d been going on with me. i made it halfway through my freshman year of high school. i missed school frequently, i still didn’t sleep much at all, and i began cutting. my grades dropped and i got my first b since elementary once grades came in. my parents were concerned but they couldn’t understand why everything was falling apart all of a sudden. i was naturally the villain since they didn’t know what else to blame it on. i still panic a little when i think about standing behind my mom and listening to my dad scream vulgarities and insults over the phone about how it’d be easier to give up on me. he apologized but it’s hard to look him in the eyes after everything he’s done over the years. i was mentally dead by then. my plan was to climb into the mountains behind my house and freeze to death before anyone could find me. the morning before i was going to do the deed i skipped class and begged my mom to let me leave. when she didn’t i started thinking of how to accelerate my plan. there was a bridge across town tall enough to end it, about twenty minutes walk away. i walked past the counselor’s office before i was going to leave and paused for a moment. i was desperate, but not for death just for relief from my suffering. thank god i made the right choice. i don’t remember how i got there but i talked to one of them, he specializes in mental health issues. it didn’t take long for him to call the police and my parents. of course, i was escorted out of the school and sent to a mental hospital the next day. it took a while, half a year maybe, but i was prescribed antidepressants and i’m on my way to recovery. there’ve been a few rough patches since, one more mental hospital visit and carbon monoxide poisoning, but i’m alive and well. maybe even happy i guess. i’ve taken up guitar, i’m learning how to sing, i started playing soccer again, and school, for the most part, is going well. during my lowest point i was more willing to die than give life another chance, but i’m glad i’m alive now. i’m not depression free yet, but it’s only a matter of time. good luck to you all, it really does get better.
how do i be less snappy when i’m talking to my mom?
i’m always so damn frustrated and impatient with my mom; i always feel like she’s saying the same things over and over. i understand why: when people care about one another they tend to just say the same shit to try and help even though none of us can really help one another.i just want to know how to be less frustrated so i don’t hurt her.
in this moment...
right now, in this moment, i feel for the first time in 7 years that i might be able to survive. i might be able to live as an adult in this world. i’ll have to keep working so fucking hard to live with my mental illness, but maybe, just maybe, i can do that. maybe someday i will be happy and want to live. maybe someday i will be able to put aside this belief that nothing exists and nothing matters and just live for the sake of living. maybe i will find love, maybe i will get a job, maybe i will get my license, maybe i will get a peaceful night of sleep.this hopeful feeling isn’t going to last, but i want to get it down so i can look back tomorrow and remember. maybe i can inspire someone with my words. whoever you are, person reading this, take care of yourself. thanks for reading.
if you are hurting, please read this, my story might help give you the courage to fight back against the darkness. i’m always here to listen to anyone who needs it.
so i’ve been living with multiple mental disorders my entire life and on top of it all, i’m autistic. god knows i’ve been in some dark places in my life, abusing drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. thoughts of suicide constantly creeping into my head. broken relationships, heartbreak, loneliness. in my 23 years on this planet, i have always thought, “why me?” “why was i out here with so many issues?” and i just had so much anger towards my parents for creating me with issues. i told friends i didn’t have plans past 30 years old. i told them i didn’t want to get married and ruin someone, i didn’t want kids and pass on my disabilities to them and ruin their lives too. i felt happy when i was alone and sad when i was with friends. i’m sure a lot of you feel these same things on a daily basis too. but i finally reached out to my family and they supported me and my close friends supported me. i quit doing drugs, started going to the gym and got myself into the best shape of my life. i went from almost dropping out of college with a 2.2 gpa 2 years ago to graduating 3 weeks ago with a 3.0 gpa and a degree in public relations with a minor in general business. i built new relationships with people i never would’ve met if i dropped out. i gained confidence and started asking out and talking to girls who would have made me shake and sweat profusely if i tried to talk to them before this. i’ve had dates with sorority girls, and it’s proof that we can all make changes in our lives no matter how tough we have it. it’s just about confidence and self esteem. 2 things in my life that were extremely low until i started self evaluating myself. started practicing speaking in my room. started smiling at myself in the mirror, trying to ignore the flaws i used to see. now i can speak in front of entire classes and my clients. can talk to attractive girls and make them feel nervous for a change. you can all do this too. i promise.lord knows i still struggle everyday. i still get the dark thoughts that try to get me to relapse, but i’m trying to be a better person, to challenge myself everyday to do something new, talk to somebody different, make new friends, go on adventures. and my demons will always be there in my head, grabbing me and trying to pull me back into my darkness, but for now, i’m here fighting like crazy because i will not go back into the darkness without a fight. find that one friend who truly supports you and has your best interests. for me it’s my best friend. when i start to feel darkness, i face time her and she is always there to pick up and talk to me no matter what time it is. she listens to me and gives me advice, and sometimes it’s harsh advice but it’s what i need at the time. she gives me peace of mind, she truly loves me and i probably would’ve taken my life if i didn’t meet her 2 years ago. find that person in your life and when you do, hold them close, don’t let go because we all need support if we’re going to make it through the pain.for everyone out there struggling, you will get through this. we are the strongest people out there. we face death and darkness and stare it in the eyes. we push it away from us and we’re still here. no one can call us weird or different because we aren’t boring and ordinary. we are strong, unique individuals who have a story to tell. you are all beautiful and full of life. please don’t ever feel like you aren’t worth anything because i grew up with those thoughts and once i figured things out, i realized that i still have a lot to give to this world, even if i am autistic, even if i have borderline personality disorder and ocd and severe depression and anxiety. through all of my disorders, i’ve still managed to make my life into something i can feel proud of, even if it took me 23 years of pain and suffering to get here. i love you all. keep fighting and remember how beautiful and unique you all are:) treat everyday like a step in the right direction. try and do something each day that brings you positivity. for me it’s art, but it could be sports, cooking, reading a good book, etc. find your happiness and carry that with you. we got this guys. i promise:)
this semicolon tattoo keeps me going everyday. i could end it all but when i look at the tattoo it reminds me that i must go on. (project semicolon)

i feel down for no reason at times, even while being with friends
sometimes i’ll be doing good and having fun with friends and then i just start feeling sad. they’ll usually ask if i’m good and stuff and i say things like “yeah i’m fine”. i don’t really believe myself, and i know they don’t either at times. they tell me they are there to talk if i need, but since i feel depressed for no reason i don’t know what i would say to them. i want to talk about it but all i know is that i randomly feel depressed for no reason, there’s no big event or smaller event it’s just random. what are some things i could talk about? they want to help me and i’d like to receive it, but what am i supposed to do? just tell them i feel depressed for no reason at times?
19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further
just graduated high school may 2019 and turned 19 at then end of september but now that i'm finally done with school whats next for me? working as a slave for 50 years? or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? i'd rather be dead than do that. i work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. my brother and i want to move out but i can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how i want my life to go on. i've seen plenty of threads here on reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. like i said i'm 19 and i feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, i'm still a teenager i should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. i sleep about 12-14 hours a day and i still take naps and otherwise i'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality i was given or typing shit on reddit because i feel so helpless that i need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. i have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that i either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. i barely even eat because i'm too depressed to even crave food, i can tell i'm hungry but mentally i have no interest in food unless i'm smoking weed. i've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. i'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful i just don't understand. it feels like i was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long i sit and logically think about it i cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. and to top it all off when i was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like crackhead or you look like an old man, you look like a hobo, looks like albert einstein, do you wash your hair? and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence i once had. all that i really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is illegal to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling me that i'll be punished by other human beings if i have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that i choose to have in my life) does the government have consent of my body? yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? to live without being under someone else's rule?  or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? i'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. i just don't know what to do anymore i just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and i have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. i 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position i'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. i'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what i'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something i'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. i'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, i just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. there's a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day i just imagine how peaceful it'd be after i kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. its almost too good to be true but i guess thats a fair trade for my life.
do you ever want to just not exist?
 not kill yourself, but not ever exist ever again.i have 0 friends. my family just doesn’t quite understand, and i’m too different to even want to explain it to them. my dad is financially depressed and doesn’t see the point in proceeding, and i’m feeling the same feeling he is. i just want someone to talk to who isn’t a therapist for once. i wish i wasn’t so alone all the time.
i do hope sincerely.

the only thing that helps me fight. painting. not an original idea.

hi! i'm the new mod
hi all! i'm rtmiu. i'll be taking over as mod for the time being.around two and a half years ago, wulfy and i met and grew close. we were both in fairly dark places in our lives, but we helped each other through it. at some point during that, we thought that others might be helped by the same thing, so wulfy made /r/depression_help. they looked after it too (even when it was empty), but as life went on and took over, we got preoccupied and eventually forgot. we're both sorry about that.but the greatest thing about this place is that it managed to grow without us; even through your collective pain, stigma and struggles, you managed to make this community thrive and be there for each other. i thank you all and am inspired by your kindness and generosity. you embody the collective strength of the human spirit.that said, this subreddit isn't without issues, or toxicity. as a mod i'll do my best to listen to everyone and keep out any hate or antagonism.  feel free to tell me if anything is wrong, or right! i wish you all the best :)
i would check myself into psych if i still had insurance
but no, lost my fucking job so thats totally unaffordable now. fucking kill me.
your abusers are not entitled to your forgiveness

depression isn’t crying and breaking down. this is what depression looks like, it’s not just crying and breaking down. it’s smiles and laughs that cover the pain. don’t for a second think someone is okay bc they laugh at your jokes. everyone can use a friend even if they seem happy.

my battle with depression and attempted suicide
my name is michael, i'm not a blogger nor am i a writer but i  wanted to share my story. june 2015 i suffered a stroke and before this happen i had a heart attack(congestive heart failure) in january 2009. at the time of the heart attack i was working in law enforcement which i think contributed to me having this along with poor eating habits.  i was in the hospital for the better part of a month and many of you know being in a hospital that long can lead you to having some pretty bizarre thoughts so i think that was the start of my first bout with depression. never having dealt with it i didn't recognize or understand  what i was going through so i never got help with it, but i knew something wasn't right. moving along to june 2015 as i mentioned i suffered a stroke which paralyzed me from my upper thighs down and i had no feeling at all and was wheelchair bound and most of the time bed ridden and it really took a major toll on me and my life. after being told 3 times that i'd never walk again and really not being able to do anything for myself, it put me in a very dark place and that's where i  started recognizing what i felt in 2009 but on a different level. i was hearing things, i was seeing things and having vivid dreams about death and i  was the killing myself each time. i also felt physical pain, inside i was so afraid but didn't wanna tell anyone about what i was going through so i put up a fake smile and pretended to be happy when i really was dying on the inside. what brought everything to the point where i wanted to end everything was one day i was home alone my son was at school and i was very thirsty so i rolled over to the fridge to get water but it was all the way to the back of the fridge. keep in mind at the time i was in a very small wheelchair because i couldn't afford one for my size, and when i reached to get the jug the chair tilted forward and i almost was thrown out of it. filled with anger and disgust feeling like i was burden to everyone i rolled the chair to my room and i was crying i couldn't see straight my head was fogged up i went to my closet and grabbed my ar15 and rolled back to the kitchen table put 2 shells in the clip, put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. to my surprise the gun didn't fire so now i'm really crying and pained i pulled the trigger again and the gun didn't shot again something it's never done before. i felt so low because i  said i can't even do this right, took the gun threw it on the floor and went to get all my pills i knew that would work as i'm coming down the hallway something said look up and when i did i saw a picture of both my kids and i  screamed so loud crying thinking about what i almost did, still holding my box of pills. i almost took myself from my babies!! not even 20 minutes after all this happened my mom walked in my house and i grabbed her crying i've never hugged and held onto my mom so hard in my life. i started telling her about what i was about to do and what i had been going through i instantly started feeling a calm come over me. for years i was embarrassed to tell anyone my story and how god spared my life that day. depression is real and if you feel anything i describe talk to someone please and to anyone whose lost a loved one to suicide talk to someone it will save a life if people know there's someone that can help them
moments like these make me so happy
i was having troubles sleeping tonight, so i decided i'd just get on the pc and play cs:go until i felt tired enough to sleep. i went to deathmatch and hit go, and then i got sent to a game. first thing i noticed when i got to the terrorist / anti-terrorist screen was that the entire game was filled with bots, except for one person. when i started playing, i heard a younger boy crying on the mic. i decided to grab my mic and ask him if he was okay. he said he was on a game with a bunch of big kids, and they made fun of him for his voice, and they booted him out. i started talking to him and told him about my personal story about being bullied and stuff like that. after a while, i asked him if he wanted to join a game with me that had actual players. he said yes, and as we both picked the same team, i said over the mic, let's get 'em, dude!, and he excitedly said, yeah, let's get 'em! and... our team lost. but he didn't care. he was just so happy that he had someone nice to game with that wouldn't make fun of him. we can all learn a lesson from this. at one point in our lives, we all were in his shoes. what we need to do is make sure that we're all taken care of.

always late for work
i’ve been consistently late for work by about 15 minutes the past couple of weeks. my boss has noticed and asked if i’m happy in my current position. i told him i was fine and would do better to be on time. every morning is a struggle to get out of bed. every morning is a challenge, and by running late it snowballs into a stressful and triggering day. all i want to do is stay in bed and sleep. how do you force yourself to get out of bed? how do you deal with tardiness?
healing emotional wounds is uncomfortable, but the short sting beats losing your mind to a lifetime of despair.
been writing a daily affirmation for myself each morning when i wake up - i check in with what i need for the day and i've found it really helpful. last night i finally got to talk to a friend i've been feeling a lot of hurt over, it's not all better, but certainly just being able to have a conversation helped.   healing from emotional wounds takes action, but i often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though i know i'd  feel way better if i did something. it's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. i want  to feel good in this life, so i do the work on the road to recovery.  and i can't just try once and then give up, i have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort. 
hey guys, let me know if this is against the guidelines, but it's been a year since i first got help for a 5+ year depression, and i'm doing so much better! i made a video about it, if you want to watch it, but it does get better! :) [tw]

why can't my friends and family see that i'm not fine?
so this is hard for me, i really don't know where to start. i've never felt fine, in my 31 years i can't remember actually feeling happy. sure i smile and pretend i'm ok to everyone i know. i get myself to work each day too, but only because it's a routine. pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that i couldn't sleep and i was having panic attacks about nothing.  so i finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... and referred me to see a psychologist but i've had bad experiences with councilors when i was really bad at uni. so i got anxious about it and never went. i didn't want to be judged for what happened either.i've tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. if i lean on her too much she drops her bundle. she tells me she's happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because we're getting older. i've told her that i'm not having kids until i feel better, then i smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. otherwise we work really well together, except i never really feel like i feel in love with her. 7 years on i'm still waiting for that spark.my family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldn't notice if i wasn't around. they are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how i am or if they do don't listen to what i have to say.i hate my job, sure most people do, but i find it so sole destroying. feeling so shitty, i find it impossible to apply for others. i feel so trapped.i don't really have any friends i feel i can trust. at any rate i never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade.ultimately i feel so incredibly lonely and isolated. ive thought about leaving everything behind and taking a trip. riding to alaska and back again type thing. i've thought about breaking up, but i only feel like i would be more alone.i don't want to die, but i don't want to live either trapped in this terrible no man's land i've created for myself. reddit can you help me figure my shit out.tldr, i feel trapped in my situation in life and need help getting help xdedit: i'm overwhelmed by the kindness of everyone here, i truely appreciate everyone who took the time to read or comment. 
i'm about to lose my mind please someone help
i just can't take it anymore! i feel like shit again. i'm scared to be alone again. i want to break this vicious circle but it keeps spinning around me! please somebody help me! i feel that my heart is about to get torn apart. i have no friends to trust either internet or real life, not a single fucking person want to help me. i am lost and i don't know what to do! please somebody help
to whoever needs to hear this...
i was army infantry for 10 years. did 3 tours in iraq. i've had ptsd and depression for a while now. it gets really dark sometimes, even with my wife (who is wonderful) and kids (who are great but a handful) pulling me up. i've checked myself into the va mental ward for suicide thoughts, been fired for threatening co-workers, and lost friends because of the way i speak.it does get better. it's a struggle everyday. it's not easy at all. but there are reasons to keep going, to keep trying to make things better. i don't have all the answers. hell most days i don't have any answers. i just have hope i guess.keep fighting. you can pull through.
curious?
does any body go through periods were they are ok and then other days they just want to die. but they don't want to kill themselves as in slicing there wrists? they just want to disappear, not exist any more. 
even the darkest night will end and the sun will shine

i'm finally starting medication for my depression/anxiety! my best friend cheered me on!

what’s wrong with me? why can’t i move?
i haven’t been able to get out of bed, quite literally, in 2 months. every passing day that i lay in this filth, it gets harder and harder to even want to move. i’ve given in to the belief that i am worthless and useless and incapable of progress. i have tried several times ti get out of bed and clean myself and clean my surroundings and respond to calls and messages. every time i try to move it is like something heavy and dark is pulling me down. some force greater than gravity. i can’t move. i feel absolutely disgusting and i smell horrible. you can imagine what you’d smell/feel/look like after 2 months of not cleaning yourself. i can taste blood in my mouth which i am assuming is my gums bleeding from not brushing my teeth. i know how awful this is. you don’t have to tell me. even with all of this...i am still unbothered. i suddenly don’t care about myself at all and i am wondering what happened to me. i came home from a work trip 2 months ago, threw my suitcase on the floor in my room and just went to bed. haven’t gotten up since. never even unpacked. i have since lost my job because i just stopped showing up. now i am living in a filthy room due to my neglect. there are dirty clothes all over the floor...i can’t even see the carpet anymore. food...leftovers...wrappers...junk all over the place. roaches i suspect due to the leftover food. i don’t care and that’s the worst part. i only eat one small meal a day. i don’t even need to step on a scale to see how much weight i’ve lost. i can feel my skeleton. i can’t cry even when i try to. i feel completely void of emotion. but i want to change. i want to move forward with my life but this weight i carry is so heavy...i am so overwhelmed with the amount of things i need to get done...thinking about all the effort and energy (i don’t have) that it’ll take....i’m so tired. god...i am so damn tired. please...someone help
i gave up
all i do is eat sleep and lay on the couch. i dont want to do anything else. i dont even want to do that. nothing makes me happy. i’m on meds. plenty of them. nothing matters. how do i get out of this?
no longer so suicidal, but still have 'death envy' is that normal/healthy?
i'm in a much better place and generally more content and healthier mentally. i no longer feel like jumping in front of a train or hurling myself off a building. but i feel ok if my plane were to crash for example, i feel that's fine n peaceful. also when thinking of ones who have passed away, i have a tinge of 'death envy', like they have moved on and no longer deal with the trivial things in life. i still want to live tho.is that healthy?
i don't see a future. i find that ultimately i am a useless lump living. might as well be a dead lump. that way i could be disposed off and people can get on with their lives. i am sorry.
meh.edit: thanks to all who answered. still alive. not there yet. some days are still incredibly difficult. and no the future is still hazy. but, somehow i have been pushing, and hope those of you who have been feeling hopeless and suicidal may feel better.

overwhelming sadness
does anyone else just get hit with an overwhelming amount of sadness and the feeling of being stuck in life? i’m in the bathroom at work just sobbing, and i can’t stop.
does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down?
the best way i can describe how i feel is: feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life.i can feel emotions. when i’m with friends and family or watch a funny video i laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? lifeless? like on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the happiest) i know i should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason i can’t seem to get past a 5 at most. it’s like my brain is saying “this is funny you should laugh and feel happy” but i just don’t feel that? at least not fully. it’s like my 5 is other people’s 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. when other people are laughing so much they’re in tears and can’t catch their breath i’m only chuckling, even though i *know* the situation is funny. i can’t even remember a time where i laughed so much i was in tears. when i laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that i could just as easily not do. this is hard to explain but when i laugh and smile it’s like i’m not physically feeling it. what i imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when i smile/laugh the outside physically changes but inside i don’t feel anything. it almost feels as if i’m acting but i’m not because i do know the situation is funny. it’s like there’s a disconnect somewhere. it’s hard to explain. and this is just one emotion, i feel this with everything. the only emotions i seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyance/anger and sadness, but even that’s toned down, not saturated, lifeless.
one of the happiest moments ever is when you find courage to let go of what you can't change.

how do i help my depressed gf
my gf seams to be really close to serious depression i talked with her the other day and she told me all this stuff about how sad she is how nothing excites her how she doesnt feel it matters if she died. all of this is new to me and i think very logically so my natural answer is to come up with a solution. like tell me the things that make you happy try to think more positive stuff like that but this isnt the correct answer i know she doesnt want a solution right now but i don't know what to give and i want to help her. advice?
i think i'm losing control. i'm getting therapy and have the support of family and friends and it's not getting better.
from mid december to march i witnessed my girlfriend's (both mid 20's) steep decline into depression and felt totally helpless. i've been working with my own therapist lately and i've come to the realization that during her depression, i went through a steep decline in self-esteem because of the immense shame i was feeling.   i feel totally inadequate as a person. i wasn't funny enough to cheer up my girlfriend, i wasn't smart enough to find a solution for her, i wasn't strong enough to save her. at the lowest point in her depression, she started cutting, drinking and smoking. she also completely pushed me away and started hanging out with people we both used to describe as toxic when things were good.  i tried my best to support her with what i knew at the time. i always told her she wasn't alone and that i was there for her, i encouraged her to seek help from a therapist/medical team. when she asked for space, i tried my best. i never pressured her to be intimate (her depression stems from sexual assault in the past), i avoided her triggers (the one's i knew about). i do have regrets though, i know i could have been a better listener. i tried to fix things for her even though i know now that i couldn't.&#x200b;in february she asked for complete separation for a few weeks so she could work on herself and i did that for her. it was the hardest time in my life. i was so scared for a number of reasons and i constantly ran through scenarios in my head ranging from she's having fun without me and doesn't want me to she's going to commit suicide. we met up once 2 weeks into no-contact and i was in a bad place. i felt totally rejected and i was very vulnerable in front of her. i cried in her car for about an hour and she tried to comfort me. i know she wasn't in a place to support me, but i was a mess.  after a few weeks of no-contact, we met up again and she had decided she needed to work on herself and try and heal, and that she couldn't be in a relationship at the same time. she broke up with me the day before my first scheduled therapist appointment. i also think she felt guilty for my decline in self-esteem over the past few months and thought that i would be better without her in my life.   after 6 weeks i've gotten to a point where i understand that neither of us were in a position to support each other the way things were. i'm grappling with serious shame because i continue to blame myself for her depression, as well as the ways i've acted since breaking up. in the first few weeks, we saw each other a few times, and one day she was really upset and i was able to comfort her until she calmed down. after calming down, she told me she loved me and tried to kiss me. i talked with her after this and told her i'm always here to listen and support her, but i couldn't hear her say i love you or go back to being in a relationship. she apologized and since then we've barely talked.&#x200b;through friends, i've found out she's doing quite a bit better and she's finally having more good days that bad. she's on the road to recovery without me, and i feel like i'm still in a downward spiral. she won't talk to me at all, she deleted me on facebook and our mutual friends are starting to get fed up with me because she's all i can talk about. it feels like every interaction i have with people,  i twist into a narrative that i'm a bad person. i feel so ashamed that i couldn't help her, and that now that she's starting to do better, i can't just feel happy for her and leave it at that. i'm feeling jealousy whenever i think of her being happy, because it's not with me, and then i feel guilty for not being able to happy for her recovery. it's a viscous cycle.

hi, i'm 16 and i need help, i don't wanna relapse.
hi, i'm blake. i've had depression since i was 8 and i started zoloft and lamictal at 14. i've had a lot happen to me, i think all of us have. i've been doing better. i quit porn (or i haven't orgasmed to it), i've tried being nicer, and i'm working on being a better person. the issue is...i've been an asshole to my parents as of late..i made my mom cry with how i don't respect her. i've done so many fucked up things in the past, stuff i can't even speak of. i try to forgive myself, but i can't. i just wallow in self pity when i get sad and play the victim. i have been the victim, yet i use it as an excuse at times. i need help forgiving myself for the things i've done, they haunt me every day. i say i'll change, and i do for a while...but then i relapse. i can't accept that i need to feel shitty for the things i've done. i would like some advice, real advice, on how to forgive yourself even after continuously messing up after you say you'll be better. i need help. thank you.edit: thank you for all the support, it means a lot. i'm sorry i didn't flesh out my post, but it's just hard to dwelve into. if you wanna hear stuff, just message me, i don't wanna plague you all on here with my issues. seriously, thank you though.
my life is literally ruined,i will kill myself tomorrow
 lemme start by saying when i was in junior school my grades were a+. and i were acing every exam literally,but in highschool? my life went downhill,i became lonley,depressed,failure,no one would talk to me cause of my anxiety,i got bullied by everyone i know,even girls used to bully me cause im shy and have social anxiety,even tho all of that i managed after highschool to get into college,i was happy and i thought i sorted life out,at first semester when the mid terms (quizzes) started i used to rank 4 or 5 out of 40,i used to study,but everyone continued to ignore me,i would do lab hours alone,eat food alone,and ya u guessed it my classmates used to talk shit behind my back,i once put my phone to record what they say when im not there,i expected no one to talk about me,but all of them were like why does dude come to uni,he's useless,i felt dead at that moment its like something my spirit out and just lemme control this human vessel,no feelings inside,nowdays i sleep 10+ hours,barely study,and i spent most of my hours when im not sleeping on porn...,just i should do it? do i have something to live for? im 22 and i never know how does it feel to be loved/or even liked for fuck sake,i just want someone to message me without asking for favors,why humans are so fucking selfiesh
how do you get over feeling unlovable?
i've always felt just very second place to everyone in my life, but that i can at least rationalize away by saying that they're at least still friends with me at all. but as far as anyone being romantically interested in me, i just feel so completely unlovable in every way. like my depression keeps people from wanting me. but i'm always someone's rebound. i'm the person who gets hit up after someone got dumped or if they need something quick or they need a distraction. someone just did that to me and it just destroys my self-esteem every time. i'm not worth putting time or effort into, but i'm worth hitting up for nudes every time someone hits a hitch in their actual relationship. i'm worth a hey wanna hook up? but never actually any emotional connection with anyone.how do you cope with just feeling like you're not ever going to get what everyone around you already has?
hi folks, hope wherever you are in your journey that today is a good day. i’m reading a book right now that i wanted to share. if you’re struggling with depression and anxiety, you may want to check this out.

if you need a friend to talk to, pm me at anytime, any hour, any day.
we could talk about anything. i don't judge at all. i'm always here for you.  
lesson from uncle iroh. but, seriously, it's never too late to find yourself. you just have to not be afraid to look

yes another bad night. yet another painting.

randomly breaking down
  i randomly break down and cry without warning. previously, it didn’t happen often; and when it does, i was would be able to control it for a bit till i find myself hidden from people’s eye. i.e: toilet, server room etcrecently, its like i control it anymore. the only thing i am able to do, is cover my face with my palms when that happens. i am m/27 and im a working professional. like i wear formal to work on a daily basis. i really dont want people to see me breaking down. do anyone experience similar?how do you hope with it ?
i prefer my fake life
(first of all sorry for my english, it is not my mother tongue)title. i am a 18 y.o. boy and for almost two years i have been creating fake profiles on social media, last one i created is the only one i use now and is a 18 y.o. girl. with her i have many online good friends and i can talk with them when i feel sad, they always make me feel better and that's the reason i can't delete that fake profile. i could but never take advantage of that profile for making money or anything, the only thing i want is friends.in my real life i have a couple friends but they're as emotionally reserved as me, so we don't talk about our problems or emotions. i tried but can't find a friend who can talk about this. where i am from boys must be cold and without emotions.i want to leave that fake profile because i'm too attached to it, i spend hours per day on it, but i can't. i don't know what to do. help is appreciated.
i just can’t anymore.
my best friend got married yesterday, but didn’t even bother to tell me that he was getting married.  i only found out after other people i know started posting photos from the wedding.  i don’t know what i did to deserve this.he was my last friend, but not really i guess.i am transgender and since coming out all of my friends have abandoned me, one-by-one until he was all that was left.  i get it though, truly, who wants to be friends with someone like me?  hell, even after well over a year of hormones, makeup practice, and other efforts i could never hope to pass as a woman.  it’s probably just too embarrassing to be seen with me; even the trans subreddits barely register my selfie attempts.  the only people who ever say anything positive about me are people i pay.i have been trying to stay positive, but this is bullshit.  i just want something to go right for me; just for once.    i go out of my way to help people all the time, listen to their problems, and just generally try to be positive.  it makes me sad and angry that i don’t have anyone who would be like that for me.halp.
eating well while really depressed
i find it really hard to remember to eat since i don’t have the energy to cook and can’t afford to always eat out. i’ve been buying groceries and then i end up not being able to cook them and it they go bad. i really would like to reduce my food waste while still eating well because i know that’s important. i’ve got some things with protein, grains, and healthy fats that have been good but i’m really struggling with fruits and vegetables. even just going through the effort to was and cut fruits and vegetables seems like too much. and i have a weird aversion to eating things without cutting them. does anyone have any suggestions?tl;dr: help me eat fruits and vegetables
my client that i work with every day told me something that really hit me in my feels and fucked me up
i work with a guy who has cerebral palsy, but it only affects his legs/feet, mentally he is fine and is pretty self sufficient— only needing help with a small amount of things.anyway, we were having some random discussions and he was like “you know why you don’t care about much or about how people treat you badly?”and i’m like “what do you mean?”and he said “you don’t care because you’re already broken”i was like damn. how accurate. when i went home i had to cry a bit on that one.i’m sure there’s multiple factors/reasons for it, but i’ve suffered with depression since a young age. i just didn’t know what it was for a long time.
someone else in my skin would be happy, i've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here i am
i'm a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. yet i think about suicide every day. but i feel like i don't have a right to. other people don't have a lot of the things i have. i'm objectively very lucky and have everything i could want to be happy. so why is life so hard?i've started drinking almost every day. i'll go to the bar alone and drink. i'll drink until i get sleepy. then i go home, and sleep. the next morning i wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. then after work i hit the bar again. alone.i'm just so lonely. why don't people like me. i try not to be an asshole. i really do. i don't think i'm an asshole? but i think people are uncomfortable around me. i think i sour their moods. i try not to be negative though. i try really hard.i feel my youth wasting away. i feel the passage of time very heavily. these are supposed to be some great years. maybe even the best yesrs. single, big city, acceptably good looking. college certainly wasn't the best years for me. so maybe this is when my life is supposed to peak?but i have no friends. i have no one to hang out with. i don't have a girlfriend. i have no one i connect with deeply.i've tried cognitive behavioral therapy. but as soon as i stopped going (feeling like i was fixed) the problems began again. i've been medicated for depression consistently for years now. i've even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. improved my diet. stopped smoking weed. i feel like i've done everything.what can i do now? i feel trapped. i wish i would just die. life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass can't take advantage of it. someone with a better personality or someone more capable would have a very happy life in my skin.i think of killing myself every day. i won't do it. but the thought, that's not normal right?this turned into a rant and i apologize for that.
so i was handcuffed and thrown into the back of a cop car... over a phone call
my friend damien thought i was going to kill my self. i wasn’t going to act on anything and i never said i was going kill myself just that i was depressed over my divorce and ect.i’m asleep it’s 11am and i get woken up by 2 hard knocks on the door. two police officers let themselves in without even explaining why. they stated my friend called and said i was going to kill myself and they then deemed i was a risk. i refused to go with them becuase i didn’t know what the hell was going on.they handcuffed me, threw me in the back of the car and sent me to a mental ward. i was dehumanized, traumatizes and mentally abused by the staff. i’m not sure if i have any legal rights to purse. i was on emergency detention. so they could withhold me for 72h or longer as deemed by the psychiatrist. but when i saw the psychiatrist, he saw i was fine and i was discharged 24h later. how horrible do you think i felt. :( 
how to get your life back on track after depression (practical guide)

my resignation
i’m a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety a couple of years ago., and recently i was diagnosed with panic disorder. i’ve been on medication for quite some time now and i’ve been able to manage things up until late. i’ve been working for this big company for about 4 months now and had nothing but good experiences throughout.last week i experienced my first panic attack. it was a ride. these attacks went on for days. and once i was able to see my doctor we found out that i had panic disorder, and that my depression and anxiety were contributing to the development of this new disorder. we discussed what i’ve been experiencing and she advised me to resign from work. i decided not to do that and try to work on and power through it, but it only made things worse. fast forward to today, i decided to resign from my company because my conditions were getting in the way of me being able to do the work that was expected of me, and it’s been taking a physical toll on my body as well. i had to explain to my superiors why i decided to resign, and i did my best to explain to them. to my surprise they didn’t ridicule or judge me. they gave me encouraging messages. they gave me support and understanding.being a young man with depression we all know that comes with it’s fair share of stigma. i was blessed enough to be employed by a company who’s superiors are understanding.right now i’m on the road to recovery. hopefully it all goes well.
i want to be happy again... i hate myself
i have no friend and my anxiety it tearing me down. i fail everyone around me including myself and all i want to do is feel like i’m making someone proud. my fiancée doesn’t understand my anxiety which make me feel like a burden. why does life suck so much. all i want is to feel loved. show me you love me.
i'm nothing without my medication.
hey, i'm bradley. i'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. this year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. it's stressful, but i always avoid getting stressed. here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, i don't worry about the exams. so in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.medication started about a month or two ago. so far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. i won't elaborate on my problems but basically i have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. and it has been tough. seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. my mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. just school, sports and home. a cycle.everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. i get easily angry, especially to my friends and i tend to be impulsive during these anger moments. it's tough dealing with depression. really tough. medication just makes it seem like i can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (i mean, when i was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). i seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. i don't know if i should see it that way or whether i should take things on my own. it's masculinity, right? if we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?people always tell us that it'd be better if they understood what i was going through, but must i really tell _everyone_ that i have depression?
i’m depressed and can’t tell anyone
can anyone please help me bc i scroll through youtube and reddit for hours every night and i can’t stop and i hate my life and wanna die but can’t end myself so fuck you
small amounts of compassion can change peoples lives

really wish i had a friend that understands me.

was already depressed, then my father died
i’ve never lost someone this close to me before. it’s hard to tell the difference between my normal depression level and what is added on to that from this loss. it wasn’t a sudden unexpected death, so maybe that made it a little easier. i cried a couple of times thinking about him, but most of the time i’m just depressed like usual. it’s been a couple of weeks now. i’m not really sure if i’ve actually mourned his death. i just feel empty inside, but that’s my normal state.
dealing with parents who refuse to understand your depression?
i'm honestly so tired. i feel like a shitty child. they've been stressed out because of me. it makes me feel worse and i feel like there is no hope left. i can't snap out of it... i've tried to explain them but they refuse to understand.this is an edit after a week: guys... i told my dad about the severity after pursuing them... :') he will come to meet my doctor
cant get motivated to do anything, even shower
i'm going through my first very difficult breakup after 12 years of marriage to a man who is my best friend and who knows me (and i him) better than anyone, he's been my other half for so long, and he was my first relationship ever. i am living with my parents while i try to basically start my life over, on my own, and my depression has almost completely engulfed me.there are a lot of days where i can hardly motivate myself to get dressed, let alone shower or other basic tasks. i try to go outside and at least take a walk but even motivating myself into doing that is like pulling teeth.i've been thinking of making a couple lists for me to check off each morning so i can at least get a routine down. i need to find a job and start being productive so i start feeling better about myself and my situation.
it’s 3:38am on saturday january 11, 2020 and as i write this, i’ve taken that next step.
ok long story incoming._________________________i’m someone that never knew that i struggled with depression my whole life as a kid. it was just chalked up to something that was just me being sad. turns out, far from that fact. as someone that is a christian, i didn’t know it today/tonight?, but i was given divine intervention. i love music and just a song came to mind for me, “i can only imagine”. that song to me just summarized everything i’ve been feeling for as long as i can remember at least 10-15 years of suffering, gone. i’m dedicating my life now to serving everyone afflicted by this and know that you can get help. i know that for a lot of people it’s hard: trust me, i bloody know. the darkness is temporary. the light shines bright. i’m signing myself up for a gym membership and going today when i wakeup, i’m going to start doing things that i like that bring value to me. ok ramble over. chat with me in the comments please. love you all even though i just stumbled upon this subreddit today.
am i the only one who still “acts like a child” ?
when i get overwhelmed/anxious/panic mode , lately i’ve been resulting in like scream-crying. i don’t know why all of a sudden my normal semi-quiet cries have turned me into a screaming mess. i feel like a child again. i used to have these temper tantrums when i was a kid-flail on the couch & tense my muscles with frustration. i thought i had grown out of that a bit ago but it seems to be back.. i’m a highly sensitive person so anything can set me off into tears-which is my bodies way of releasing the stress i hold in. but it’s just so frustrating. i just like scream cry of frustration because i can’t like let something go, i don’t even know. when a bad thought is on my mind, or even an expectation that i don’t believe i can accomplish/seems to hard to complete, i just get so frustrated that i can’t accept it or take it not as negative as i did, so i like scream and crying for like 20minutes-which if you have ever done, is pretty dehydrating. and when i’m in that “zone” it’s like i can’t even think to help myself, i just feed into the emotions i feel. it’s like i kinda go crazy for a bit, then after i have that guilty shameful feeling of feeling like i acted so childlike & weal & incapable of helping myself. is this a normal response to someone who has been depressed & anxious daily for the past 10 years ? (i’ve been in&out of therapy since then too)what’s another stress outlet besides crying? (like taking a walk or drawing is not considered a stress outlet for me because it actually causes me more stress; ex- walking outside in public makes me so anxious/stressed cuz of my social anxiety) plus it doesn’t seem like it “releases” any stress because i don’t feel a relief, i just feel the same..
i'm getting better, and i wanted to let you know that
i've had depression for about seven or so years now, with some up and down periods. i think my oficial first diagnose was in 2015, and since then i tried getting professional help. the first few times didn't work very well, and i would end up dropping the medication.the last treatment i've been on, however, seems to be working. i'm not as blindly optimistic as to say i'm cured! because no, of course i'm not. i still have problems, i still have consequences of those years of sickness that i have to work hard to overcome. but, for the first time in so, so long, i have hope that i can do it. i can finally see a light at the end of this awfully dark path, and i feel like i can reach it one day.this post is not to give you a definite solution to your problem, though. each case is different, and what works for me may not be helpful at all for you (i mean specific things, like the meds i'm taking) instead, what i want to offer is the same hope i feel right now. i want to share it with you, because i've been where you are, i've felt like you feel now, and i know what it is to think you'll never get better, like well, this is my life now, i guess i'll just suffer until i die. i know that feeling oh so well, and it pains me to think about those days when i felt like that. and i know many of you feel that way right now.i want to share my hope with you. i want to tell you that i'm not a lucky one that magically got better. there were years of struggles. i tried different treatments, i visited different doctors, i took different medications. it has been a long process of trial and error. along the line bad things have happened in my life; a few years ago i lost my grandmother, and i've also buried four of my cats (they are like my babies to me, you'll understand if you have pets). my life is not perfect and rose colored. so it's okay if yours isn't either.the only advice i can give you is that you keep trying. get help, both professional and from family and/or friends. also places like this sub. just because we're a bunch of strangers in the internet, it doesn't mean you can't ask us for help. there will always be a hand there to help you, even if you can't see it, even if you don't believe anyone will care. that's your illness talking. there is always someone to help you.and finally, with enough time and help, i hope you can get better. just like i am. thanks for reading. best wishes! <3
i feel guilty for being depressed
every single time i open my eyes and feel overweily empty like i have no reason to do anything i feel so much guilt about it. like this whole stigma you have x so you should not feel sad hurts me a lot since i believe that. and when for the first time i felt like this is really gone, i found my own little happiness in life, there is no way i will feel like that again it just hit me again. when i set myself goal to not hurt myself because someone loves me at first i was like obvious to me, so easy, all i have to do to be kind to myself and now i wanna break down to tears. and the worst is that i don't wanna talk about it to someone important to me because again, i feel guilty for bothering them with my insignificant problems compared to them.  i know i should visit psychiatric about that but where i live it all goes down to oh so your parents are divorced therefore you miss your father. give me 50$. like... ???. thank's i'm cured now. and i really do not want to fully open to complete stranger to me and tell my story in nutshell. i know this feeling comes and then goes away (and then comes back), i think i got most of it figured out. it's just later in years of my life it gets more sad and i can't believe i dare to think and feel like when got this and that.   thanks for letting me to rant here a bit. at least i got someplace to let my feelings out without getting worried i waste someone's time.
guy i have been dating 2 years opened up about depression after 2 years and then disappeared??
hi all,this is my first post, i am totally new to the reddit community! so, i have been dating someone truly special to me the last couple years, and he has had a few depressive spirals since about a year into things. the most he would reveal after i would ask to get together, is that he was in a bad head space where he couldn't get out of bed sometimes and felt hopeless and as though he was in a hole. he is a very social and outgoing guy, so obviously this was very out of character for him, but i never wanted to pry or push him to talk about it, and would just offer my support and understanding and let him know i was there if he needed anything. when we would see each other next, he'd not speak a word about it, only ever opened up in a lengthy text about what was going on with him.&#x200b;fast forward to a couple months ago, i tried to make plans for a friday night, he happily agreed, and then the next night cancelled, saying he was super depressed, couldnt get out of bed, and never wanted to leave the house again. i gave him space and he asked to go out 5 days later. we went to dinner and he completely opened up about his illness, revealed he has experienced it on occasion for the last 3 years, and admitted he had a borderline suicidal thought for the first time. like he understood why people take their own lives. he was so incredibly open and vulnerable about it, i was so proud of him. afterwards, thinking i felt closer to him than ever before, i went out of town, came back and asked to get together, only to have him disappear. he would take 24 hours to respond to texts, wouldnt see me. he eventually texted me saying we should just be friends but meet up and talk. its been incredibly difficult to get him to follow through on this.&#x200b;im devastated. is he embarrassed he revealed so much? did he change his mind about me? i miss him and want to understand.
they think its a joke
everyone in class says things like oh thats depressing i'm so depressed i'm going to kill myself ect and its annoying they think its a joke and one girl cut her finger with sicssors because she saw it on tic tok and that is dumb do you know ppl who do/say dumb things like that
5 useful tips for depression
so we all have those days when our depresion is worse, perhaps we haven’t left our house for while, we haven’t slept properly or too much and food is going out window or too much.. here are some things have helped me1. idoser - i listen to idoser every time i’m feeling overwhelmed or simply want to escape reality for while..2. listen to music and podcasts, no matter what you are interested in whether you love music, your favourite radio show. 3. exercise - exercise is probably the last thing you want to doing you are feeling depressed.. but it can be your best friend and better way of coping.4. if you find the groups that nhs/council runs for depressed people to meet other depressed people is not your thing. bunk them off and find something else.. if else fails use the net.5. get into nootropics, we all love that we’ve accomplished things but often our depression has clouded that judgement and we cannot focus but we’ve got that mountain of paper work sitting on our desk.. google nootropics and order order  a bottle or two, get some from holland & barrett 6. do you have a hobby you love, perhaps think about getting one or two that suits you and suits your personality. there’s no point in joining a sports group if you hate socialising or too anxious/depressed or paying out a subscription fee if you don’t use it..7. feeling lonely and isolated, go on penpal sites, chatrooms, forums and meet people that way.. that way you don’t have to worry too much if they disappear you can go and find someone else. less effort required.. you don’t have to panic every time. are they gonna turn up?? you can turn your computer on or your mobile any time of the day and get chatting.8. make use of that button your mobile called “do not disturb,” we all have those days when don’t feel like talking or we simply want to binge watch that new drama in peace and don’t want to be interrupted, make use of do not disturb and turn your notifications off. i did this last week, i didn’t give a rats about every day problems, daily grind of life, i had done the activities i wanted to do for the day..and i simply had it with life.. so i did it and felt lots better. the group was bunked, told em had flu, switched on that games console, shoved my mobile on do not disturb, let the bugger rundown it’s battery so even if flashes i didn’t see it and a holiday from life.. 
just a reminder : you can be yourself
you should never feel bad for doing something that makes you happy or helps you cope, (provided, of course, it doesn’t harm yourself or others).i don’t care if you like pumpkin spice. i don’t care if you like to screech like an autistic kid. i don’t care if you make shitty arts / crafts. i don’t care if you dance in the shower like an idiot. i don’t care if you like leopard print stretchy pants. find whatever gives you a shred of fucking happiness in this world. take it and run and fuck anyone who judges you for it. 
people always tell you to get therapy or to get help.
yeah like i just walk up to the hospital and say one therapy please i don't know anything about this shit. where do i go? what do i ask for? do i have to pay for it? i can barely afford food. how the actual f am i supposed to just go get help? this wasnt taught in school people. i dont know what to look for. and god knows that google cant answer anything more specific than what day of the week is it. it's hard if you're the type who is easily overwhelmed you know? my brain gets fried every time i think about it.edit: thanks for all the support guys. there's a lot of stuff out there i didnt even know existed. i really appreciate your help.
i just opened my instagram to see a triggering post of my worst nightmare. the moment i see a chinese wedding i immediately get sick to my stomach thinking of my ex who will eventually be with someone else. it hurts so much. we broke up 7 months ago and i still cannot get over it. i wish i didnt see

what should i do or say when my depressed best friend starts posting things like this on facebook? i know i can’t fix anything for him or do much but there has to be something. anyone have any advice?

you are loved

feeling so depressed to the point where i'm contemplating calling out of work (again) tomorrow to get real help.
i'm struggling pretty hard right now with depression and anxiety. i could barely do anything today with how fatigued i am. my insurance is also running out on the 31st. i know i need to take time to figure out what's going on, but at the same time i can't afford to lose my job if i need time away. i just need support right now. my energy is nonexistent.
intrusive thoughts - my technique for banishing them
crossposted from depression.ok, first off, i am not a doctor. i'm just a guy who has been dealing with his own depression for the last 40+ years.one of my most persistent symptoms is the host of intrusive thoughts i get. specifically, the ones where your brain makes you ruminate on painful or embarrassing things that happened in your past. it's like you can't help but have to sit there and relive it over and over again. it's been the toughest thing for me to get rid of.anyway, i finally realized that i needed to break the cycle, and...to make along story short...i have a technique that actually seems to work. i've been using it for the past couple of months, and for this particular symptom, it seems to work pretty well.first off, the tough parts. you have to be **willing** to stop the cycle...you can get addicted to it without realizing it. then, you have to start **realizing** that you are doing it, and try to realize it *as close to the moment that you start doing it*. i'm not kidding when i say that this is the toughest part, mostly because it means diverting your behavior into something that is new to you (which is never easy). if you can do this, you really are halfway there.next, you tell yourself that you don't have to live in that moment, but instead have to live in the now. nobody can change the past, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. nobody is keeping score but you, and you don't have any reason to continue doing it. this should be a little bit jarring, like it's shaking you awake, but embrace the startling aspect of it.finally, in this moment...distract yourself. look for anything else to think about besides the intrusive thought that you were thinking about originally. this will keep you from immediately sliding back into the old pattern. i have found that, for me, thinking of a bunch of shallow topics in succession will do the trick. that's a pretty tree. hey, i'm coming up on main street. that car has florida plates. my feet are very warm right now. there's a grade school. i wonder what their mascot is. ...you get the idea. keep it up for a full minute if you can.that's it, that's all there is to it. it took longer to explain it than it typically takes to do it (once you get good at realizing when it happens).maybe this has been done before, and the technique has already been invented. i honestly don't know, nor is it particularly important to me. i just want to put this out there in the hope that it might help someone else like it helped me.
the loneliness is suffocating me and it feels like no one is ever going to decide i’m the person they’ve been looking for, plus horrible upbringing for maximum sad.
my mom died of cancer when i was in high school and for every other example of this scenario playing out in my school district the student in that situation was treated better than normal and given an easy path through the year. not me, i was treated like garbage and that wore away at a lot of my confidence. now i miss my mom because it’s been years and even though a couple months ago i was able to buy a house at 24 it feels so empty, i live with my best friend and yet it doesn’t feel the same. it’s not waking up in the middle of the night with your significant other resting on your shoulder. it’s not the late night talks about the future and all the dumb thoughts that come to mind when no one else matters but each other. i miss the fighting, i miss feeling alive with someone else. i’m never an option to anyone, i just get looked past like i’m no one and it stings. i just want to feel needed. if you have  heard love falls by hellyeah, the lyrics speak to me on a level that’s rare. i’m miserable and i hate that i have to keep walking because i’m ready to throw in the towel.
hang in there . you have come a long way and there is a long way to go.

overthinking is killing me
i have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. i have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after i had been bullied by some  friends  in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, i had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. my freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. that's when i left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. both of my parents are hard working, so they couldn't stay home with me, so i had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. i am now a sophomore and only have online friends. i overthink everything to the point where i can't even text my friends online anymore, because i worry i will say something weird. it has never gotten this bad, i used to be funny, and i didn't overthink as much. i was almost outgoing. i don't know what to do. i've tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. it is really hard for me to post this, but i need some help.&#x200b;thank you so much to everyone who responded to this. after seeing all of your comments i felt very relieved and not alone. i have been doing much better after typing this. so thank you again, knowing i am not alone helped me a lot. (:
i started doing small things like this recently. i still keep forgetting to do them. but it's still something.

nsfw i need help
sorry in advance if i format this incorrectly. i want to give a trigger warning that this post will include the topic of suicide.this is kind of my last resort, i know i shouldn't expect strangers online to help and i really don't even know what i need or want from this but i guess just someone to listen. i have been having a hard time but unlike previous times that i've felt sad, i can't link this to anything. i'm 21 and just opened a store so that has caused some stress but i'm doing what i really want to do so i should be happy, right? everyday i just get worse, my chest feels heavy and i just feel constantly sad and for the past few weeks the thought of suicide has come up in my mind more and more. i have tried talking to people, my boyfriend says he wants to help, and i know he cares, but he doesn't know what to do and i can understand that. i don't want to put my problems on him. i have tried talking to my family and i always get the same your life is good, what do you have to be sad about?i'm just at home right now, alone, and the thought of suicide is now starting to feel more and more real. i don't want to be sad but i don't know what to do and i am in so much pain. i also don't like the idea of antidepressants because i was on cymbalta for anxiety (before i felt depressed) and it completely f'ed me over emotionally and physically (that's a story for another day) so i'm really weary of going on another antidepressant. i don't know what i want from this but thankyou for listening.
i'm so tired all the time
i can barely stay awake during the day. no energy, everything feels like an insurmountable task and i can't work out how other people have the energy 
i just want a coma or something to get me to never wake up
just tierd of it all  tbhi don't want to exit
i feel alone , and a burden to everyone.
i have had depression since i was 15 , started treatment at 18. now i'm 21 and i know my mom's tired . she doesn't know what to do anymore and neither do i.i feel like i'm a burden. that i'm taking space of someone else. i feel like i should just fucking die and leave everyone alone.i want to talk to my ex because i want to feel the way he loved me again. but i know he hates me too, or doesn't even think about me anyway.i want someone to just hug me and let me cry in their arms. but i know i fucked things up and nobody can't stand me now.i don't fit in. i have no friends , no one i can't talk about this .
anyone feeling like a vulnerable child?
i’m 28f and struggling with both depression and anxiety. i have a lot of problems, but  something especially bothers me these days. i feel like a little girl who needs to be taken care of. i am scared of the outside world. i am an adult, i thought i was a strong woman but the depression and anxiety made me feel like a vulnerable, needy little child. i wasn’t always like that. i graduated from university, have worked in an important institution for 3 years. then i had to quit and my life changed completely. i got depressed and extremely anxious. now i lost my set-esteem. i feel hopeless and weak. does anyone feel like that because of depression?does it get better? what should i do?
i've all but given up on this life
update: thank you all do much, we had a conversation tonight and we agreed to separate. it was a wonderful to years, but she needs to heal properly before we can go on. i'm also going to get help. i feel better tonight than i did this morning and i think that's important.i'm only 19. i understand that if i get through this there will be so much life to be had, but things are starting to look bleak. my best friend/girlfriend is dying. she has ehlos danlers syndrome, arrhythmia, and those are both being made worse by the fact that she's developed anorexia nervosa. she's withering away and it's killing me. i haven't gotten out of bed for anything other than work for a half a week. i've been severely depressed my entire life, but this is the first time that i've wanted to kill myself. not that i want to not exist, but i fully want to kill myself. i need help.
does anyone else feel to shit to be human ?
i was walking with a friend and i was feeling terrible and she was talking abiut things a human would smile, laugh, or at least give any kind of facial and or vocal expression, and usually i at least pretend to smile etc.but today i felt way to bad and i usually responded with mhm ,uhuh, (those without even opening my mouth cuz thats top much work apparently) or the bare and absolute minimum of words to express that im still listening.  and she asked you good? and obviously because i was feeling so very not good and desperatly want help i answered yea, yea.
guess i'm alone
as the title suggests, no one gets me.im a 16 year old male who gets mediocre grades due to the fact he doesn't study. i have no gf as no one would care about my shitty face/body or childish personality.my own family critizises me for not studying hard enough while i wake up every day feeling like shit.some time ago i tried to cheer myself up and started writing 5 reasons to live every day i woke up. i can't even write two of 'em.no one knows about this as the first time i talked about it i felt worse for the reaction of my parents and how broken they were while in treatment than the actual depression. even if i didn't get any better, everyday i would act a little better until the psychologist said i was ok, even if i was only acting (look, one thing i'm good at. took me 16 years to realise).this ks my second one and the only reason i wake up everyday without ending my life is because, the only thing i really care about was what would happen to my parents if i not only died, but killed myself.if you have read this far, just want to thank you for taking your time to read through my sh*t.hope you get something more entertaining to do from now on ;).the worst part: i play videogames all day because they are the only place i feel i can be myself without anyone complaining (my parents think telling me i'm useless will help get better and want to improve myself). and they now want to take them off me saying that i play way too much. guess it won't be long until i finally explode.
i want to give up on life
i'm completely exhausted. i have no motivation to do anything in life anymore. the only things i feel like doing are sleeping, being on my phone, and eating. even then, nothing actually brings me pleasure or happiness. i can't even put effort into anything anymore because i become so distracted and everything feels so hopeless so i procrastinate so much. just thinking about what to write on this post is hard but i really really want to vent so much but i just cant explain it all. in school my grades are suffering because i end up missing school a lot, either due to depression or panic attacks. all i wanna do in life is sleep and eat and use the internet, i used to have so many interests, for example, drawing and gaming. i would draw all the time and was really into improving my art, but these days it feels like such hard work even getting a piece of paper out. when i start up my favourite games, it's sometimes hard to even play one round (like in splatoon) because it feels so pointless and repetitive. everything just feels like a chore to be honest. a lot of the time it feels painful, like emotionally painful, just to wake up, a mixed feeling of dread and sadness and fear and disappointment. this post most likely will not be noticed but these are just my feelings and i really really need advice i guess.
anyone care to share their experience with maois?
have been through most of the ssris, all the snris. after years of messing about with meds i finally got a result with wellbutrin, but there's a supply issue now in australia and it won't be available here till 2020. i'm getting pretty bad without meds so thought i might try maois. would be interested to hear about effectiveness -or not - side effects, and dietary issues. thanks.
how do i motivate myself to start reading again?
hi! so this has been an issue i’ve been struggling with for a few years now, but i have a really hard time reading and completing books. it’s annoying because it’s like my “soul” really wants to read more, like how i used to, but obviously depression is a big roadblock to that. i always find myself turning on the tv instead even when i know reading would make me feel better. anyways, i was just wondering if anyone had any advice with trying to get myself into the headspace to pick up a book more often instead of throwing on the tv.
i feel nothing
my brother's murderer was brought to justice yesterday and was found guilty. the initial relief that washed over me left me feeling ecstatic. now it has worn away, along with the trial anxiety, and i am left feeling nothing. this is the biggest nothing i have ever felt in my entire life. i keep dissociating for hours on end and it is the most bizarre thing. i really just need to know that i am going to be okay. 
i get very depressed whenever i am faced with difficult decisions. does anyone know what i could do to reduce this?
i know this sounds like a “first world problem”, but, for example, i have been offered a new job at a different company. i won’t go into details but there are many pros and cons for both accepting the job and staying where i am. i am very indecisive and the pressure of the decision is crippling me.i know it sounds stupid but the pain and pressure caused by this (and other similar decisions) has become so overwhelming i can’t stand it. i won’t do it, but it almost feels like suicide is a better alternative than living life through painful decision after painful decision.why do i feel this way?
what helps you when you're feeling depressed?

my husband found an app that was designed to help fight depression...
it's called superbetter. it includes quests,  bad guys, leveling up... it seems interesting.  i figured i'd share it with you all in case you want to try it out.  we are supposed to have allies in the app. idk what the allies are meant to do,  but i'll be yours if you need one.  my name the is huzzardbuzzard. if you can't find me there,  pm me here. i've barely used superbetter, so i have very little understanding of how it works. etn: allies don't work this way.  looks like they are real life people, not in-app people. 
some good things to know when your thoughts run away with you

(22f) under the poverty line, don't know how to apply for assistance or what i would qualify for, need help navigating the system because my head keeps spinning (not asking for money, just need help getting some)
 ((i'm new to reddit, and this is a throwaway account, so please forgive me if i committed any reddit faux pas))i need help- not direct financial aid, but help navigating the system. i know i should qualify for financial help, but i have no idea how to go about it or which programs to pursue.i'm scraping by, deep in student loan & hospital debt that i can't afford to pay because i can barely make rent, trying to save up for a super-cheap, used, under $1,000 car so i can get a better job (i currently work retail part time and take painting & illustration commissions part time), but i'm exhausted even working the few hours that i do (thanks, brain). i've been struggling with depression & anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt & an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. i can't afford counseling, and i can't get medication without a car. it's been a while since i've been on meds. not sure i would be able to afford it if i could reach it. i was raised in a cult-like christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college i was very isolated from modern culture, common sense, and a normal view of the world. because of this, i have no idea how social programs work. i'm still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. i tried applying to modest needs, was told i made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind i don't have a lot of energy at the moment...has anyone who's had similar struggles in the past have any advice? any resources? a suggestion for a place to start?...other possibly relevant details about me:\-i know that my income places me solidly under the poverty line\-i think i may have adhd or something similar but have never been evaluated for it\-i was \*\*\*very\*\*\* briefly homeless, slept in a tree at one point and in my car (had to sell) another, but there's no documentation of that (it was remarkably short, i'm very lucky)\-i live in california & i am a us citizen\-i am cis, pansexual, female, & white as a ream of printer paper\-i was disowned & cut off by my family for religious reasons\-i have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, i can't make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best\-i was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (i brought in credits) when i ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated\-i pay rent under-the-table, i don't \*legally\* reside at the place i live\-i have terrible credit- lots of student and medical debt, i've never had a credit card but i've been wondering if getting one might help\-i've never applied for any governmental assistance before (aside from scholarships)i can't think of any other details that might be relevant but feel free to ask any questions, aside from this protective anonymity i'm an open book.thanks so much to anyone who took the time to read <3
i dont know what to do anymore.
here i am sitting in my dark room bingwatching how i met your mother, i texted 2 people and only got cold responses. i feel like an imposter, like im trying too hard to do something that should come naturally. i feel like im the last piece of the puzzle that just happens to have a different picture.  i love my friends, but do they love me back? i dont know. i spend so much of my time making sure that everyone has what they need and no one does the same. my depression took over my life and people are starting to notice ajd drift from me. how long will i be the helpfull one? the one who always has time for others? the one who is always there for every one? how long will i feel this ways? for how long must i continue to live? i dont know, i just know that i am broken.
give me a reason to live.
my situation with my family has been shitty for years now. long story short...i came back for 10 days for the obligatory visit. and my mum just yelled at me because i was upset. upset that she didn't express any happiness that i got shortlisted for an interview with my dream company. she says i'm weak for expecting expressions of joy when i should apparantly already know they're happy for me. she said some pretty shitty stuff and honestly i've lost all hope. i genuinely cannot take it anymore. i need reasons. reasons not to end everything. god sometimes i just want to stab myself dead or overdose on antideps because nothing i do ever works. never good enough. too sensitive. too weak. too this too that. i've had it.please help...update: i took a nap after typing this out and woke up to some of the kindest words i've ever heard from a bunch of strangers. i wish i could personally thank every single one of you. it helped me feel less alone you know? i cried while replying to you guys it was just so necessary for me to reach out here today or i don't know what i would've done. i was at wits end before i posted this and it isnt the first time i've seriously considered and visualized suicide.i love you guys. i don't even know you all but i hope you feel it..wherever you are.
i have always been the supportive and strong friend, but now i'm losing it...
all my life i've tried to do the right thing. i usually give counsel to my closest friends without asking for something in return. i am the strong, the one who never gets sad or has emotional issues. nevertheless, i am losing it. i am tired of being strong; i am tired of appearing happy all the time (i do it for them, not because i am in the good mood all the time).  my family does not know it either, but i have to go on with my life for they need me. i am tired of loving everybody without receiving a portion of that love. i learned to love my loneliness, but now it feels like i need someone, but finding a partner who wants something serious is extremely hard (and i am not a greek god, to be honest). i do not like dependency, however, i'd love to have someone to talk to besides my friends. i lost my best friend last year since i fell in love with her (don't do it, worst idea ever). does anybody feel this way?  does anyone go through the same thing?
i finally found motivation.
after 12 years of type 1 diabetes, 3 hospitalizations, 4 years of self harming, depression, insomnia and 2 near death experiences, i am ready to take care of myself again.
i lost my passion in music.
i’m 23, still didn’t finished my music degree and i feel like i don’t deserve to graduate from this course. i first studied ab english and told my dad that i can’t see my future with it. so, he allowed me to enroll a music degree. my major is piano concentration. i loved playing the piano since 7, though i wasn’t really good at it but i know how to play it. since i got in a band in high school, that convinced my dad to take up bachelor of music. i started this course with [i think] 20% knowledge to music theory though i know how to read notes but not that fast. and i also started my first proper piano lesson. i was doing great but my first piano teacher there keep on admiring advanced students instead of others like me and that made me miserable. i didn’t progress much.by 3rd year, i had a new piano teacher and she was great. it made me go back to zero and that’s fine with me because i saw myself loving my passion again. i practice 6pm-9/10pm at school mon-sat. until.... 1 night, a piano teacher came in my piano cubicle and told me that i am not allowed to practice there til 9/10pm because i am not a advanced student and a recitalist. i told her that i need to practice in that kind of schedule because that’s the only time my body is productive to practice. so it’s like a body clock. on the other day, she reported me to the dean’s office and the dean told be that i shouldn’t be practicing on that schedule because it’s not in the rules. but i don’t remember that certain rule because i saw others practicing til 9pm so i thought it was okay. they still didn’t agree with me. after that discussion, i ran to the bathroom, cried so hard and called my dad about it. it was unfair. i was only doing it for myself because i want to be better. my dad bought me a 2nd hand electric piano so i can practice at my dorm. everything went fine at first but i can’t get that incident out my head. it made me think that i’m a loser, talentless pianist there is in that school. that’s when i started to miss all my piano lessons and dropped my piano subject 3 times in a row.it made me stayed in school since the 5th year. and i went to a psychiatrist to treat my traumas, my thoughts and insomnia. i was dianosed with depression with anxiety because of my thoughts of being afraid of what might happen next in the future. i’m terrified of tomorrows. that’s why i can’t sleep.i moved to another piano teacher because i was so embarrassed to come back to my previous one. she already gave up on me because i wasn’t making any progress. and it’s a total humilliation to her reputation. i’m on my 7th year now and my current piano teacher is also great and he really wants me to graduate next year. he was patient of letting me going back to zero and gave me piano recital pieces that i can play. but my problem now is that, it’s back. my demons are back and i haven’t returned to my psychiatrist since july. because i’m afraid and my dad already used a lot of money for my mental health, sessions, medication and sleeping pills. i’m in a 3rd world country and we are not that rich.i’m anxious that i might not graduate next year and it will make my parents misereble. i lost my passion in playing the piano that i can’t finish practicing 1 page in a day because of these thoughts and pain. i’m sorry for you to hear this. because if i will not able to graduate next year. i will kill myself. i’m typing this 3 in the morning and crying. i haven’t told anyone that it’s back. even my boyfriend. everytime someone tries to cheer me up about my progress, i get depression. imagine that. i getting depressed over positive things. i’m losing my mind, i feel so numb and i’m skipping piano classes again and i’m afraid of my piano teacher of seeing me not having any progress at all. i feel embarrassed, ashamed, angry at myself that i want to disappear right away. i feel like i don’t deserve to graduate at all, to finish college, to become a good eldest daughter...
what are things an so can do to help alleviate your depression?
i am cross posting from r/depression since i am not sure which sub is more appropriate for this i have been dating my partner for like four months now. even though we’ve only been together for a little while i am completely crazy about him. he suffers from mdd and it is so upsetting for me to see such a smart, caring, funny & lovely person being suffocated by chronic feelings of hopelessness. he often jokes about how much he would like to be dead and it’s very hard for me to hear. i wish i could give him some of my own brains happy-chemicals. seeing him like this makes me want to cry even though i want to be strong for him. i feel scared and anxious that he can’t enjoy our relationship or life as much as i do. i know that i can’t cure his depression but i wanted to ask for advice from other people with depression. what are things that your partner or friends have done that have helped to alleviate your pain or numbness?
so depressed it takes effort to breathe today. i hate days like this.
i have plenty to be depressed about, but i have plenty to be grateful for as well.  sometimes the darkness wins.  i can't see the color in flowers, can't taste the sweetness in my coffee.  all i can do is go over and over in my head about how much i hurt, how few people out there understand this pain, how much i'm dreading the next five minutes, ten minutes, 12 hours... i could be dead in a matter of seconds and this would all end, but i never go that route.  but i could, maybe one day.  but not today.
today is my birthday.
and i feel even more lonely.why is birthday such a big deal to people?i hope tomorrow comes quicker
i called to finally get help
today i called and left a message at an office that will get me an appointment with a therapist and an appointment with a psychiatrist to hopefully get me on the road to help. im so fucking proud of myself. i cant believe i actually did it. i know it will probably be a while until i get an appointment with anybody but just making the phone call was a huge step. i know it seems impossible, but if you can please get help! there is no downside. 
addicted to sadness
emotional pain can become an addiction.  a negative feeling, such as anger, worry, grief, fear, or depression, can become so habitual that you cannot live without it.  there are physical as well as mental reasons for emotional pain addiction.when a person is continuously stressed by emotional pain, there are subtle changes in the body that create a dependency on stress-related chemistry. changing habitual patterns of pain can be as difficult as giving up an addictive substance, such as nicotine, alcohol, or even heroin.  the emotional pain addict unconsciously seeks out situations that are sure to result in pain.  a history of prolonged, negative, stressful relationships is usually symptomatic of emotional pain addiction.  the feelings of love and pain are so frequently associated that they become one and the same.  loving unavailable people and staying in intolerable relationships, for example, are signs that love and pain have become intertwined.  there are many such pain-linked feelings in the repertoire of pain addiction.  understanding the physiological part of emotional pain addiction can make breaking these patterns easier.source: **pain addiction** \- [http://www.thepositivemind.com/poetry/aboutpainanddullnessarticle.html](http://www.thepositivemind.com/poetry/aboutpainanddullnessarticle.html)&#x200b;every emotion, either positive or negative, is a blend of chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) that our brain instantly produces in response to thoughts. this cocktail circulates throughout the body producing corresponding sensations that are felt at both the psychological and physical levels. the chemistry of emotion is very addictive, if repeated frequently over a long period of time -- just like the chemistry of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. this is most noticeable in the case of negative emotions, as they produce stress hormones that our body, in a twisted, self-destructive way, can easily start craving like a drug.source: **are you addicted to suffering and struggle?** \- [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-you-addicted-to-suffe\_b\_9744416](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-you-addicted-to-suffe_b_9744416)&#x200b;the presence of negative, distorted thoughts and feelings about reality leads to sadness and hopelessness. sad people see themselves as worthless and get carried away by these emotions, leading them to abandon their usual activities. so not only do they perceive themselves as worthless, but they also abandon the activities that could counter this value judgment, which validates their beliefs.this is where the vicious cycle begins, as they swap their routines and fun activities for a negative mood, without realizing that these activities could help them improve their situation and prevent their bad mood from intensifying. this creates a dynamic in which inactivity breeds more inactivity.source: **sadness can become an addiction** \- [https://exploringyourmind.com/sadness-can-become-addiction/](https://exploringyourmind.com/sadness-can-become-addiction/)&#x200b;when you live with depression for years, you can become dependent on the familiarity of the mood. the negative patterns of thought associated with depression can become like an unhealthy coping mechanism, much like drugs and alcohol are for addicts. the negative thoughts and moods associated with bouts of depression may start to feel like a false sense of security.whether this constitutes an addiction is debatable, but what is obvious is that it is unhealthy and dangerous to get comfortable or dependent on a depressive mood. it can mean that a person gets stuck in the negative thought patterns and finds it more and more difficult to change.source: **is depression addictive?** \- [https://www.lucidatreatment.com/blog/news/depression-addictive/](https://www.lucidatreatment.com/blog/news/depression-addictive/)&#x200b;so while my attachment to melancholy may not be “bad,” it would be beneficial for me to push on those moments to discover what i might be avoiding, what to bring to therapy rather than what to soothe away with a solange album. barth suggested that “one of the ways one might gradually get to those feelings is to really try to put into words what the melancholy feels like — physically as well as emotionally (like even where it’s located in your body and what color it is!).”perhaps the healthy way to approach melancholy is with moderation, to give room to those other stronger feelings even when it means making room for pain.source: **why do i love to feel blue?** \- [https://www.manrepeller.com/2018/07/sadness-and-melancholy.html](https://www.manrepeller.com/2018/07/sadness-and-melancholy.html)&#x200b;
i feel like shit and i just need to talk to someone.
dm if you want
my life is in shambles and i just want to feel happy again...
so about two years ago, my parents forced me to move cross country to accommodate for my dads new job. now, i’m 25, am a year away from losing my parents health care, jobless, and am isolated to the point where the depression i have is only getting worse by the day.now, the things that used to keep me temporarily happy aren’t filling that void anymore. help.
on paper, life is better. inside, i haven’t improved.
(i originally posted this in r/depression, but i’m under the impression that it’s full of folks who would rather seek gratification that they are not alone rather than support. maybe i’m wrong, but i am looking for feedback and a little advice, if possible. i hope to see you in a place where there is no darkness.)i really hate posting this. it’s narcissistic, but i must satisfy the gnawing hunger of loneliness. it’s shameful, but a small morsel would be a blessing. please forgive me.in summary, while i’m aware it could have been much worse, i’ve had a terrible childhood. i’ve had social anxiety, terrible social skills, and half of a family. i was the bullied and ostracized for the first half. my concept of a friend at the time were the same people who would lie, cheat, and steal from me. hopes that things would be different in middle/high school/college became disappointment as the cycle repeated itself. there were brief moments where i got a taste of what real friends were like, genuine people without judgements. however, they were very brief, and i never really made any lasting relationships.i got away from it all. i emigrated to a country far away. the first year was tough, and i thought history would repeat itself once again. however, things got better, and  i live a somewhat comfortable life (at least, relative to my past).i should be happy and fine. yet i still feel hollow and empty. despite knowing some genuine friends, i still find it difficult to put my trust in others and open up. no one wants to be forced to listen to my sob story; they have their own problems to handle. very often, my past memories come back to haunt and torment me. on the outside, i would describe myself as a tad quiet and lazy, but positive and helpful. inside, lethargic would be the best word to describe it.i am grateful for where i am now, and each moment is a blessing. at the same time, life is in auto-pilot, and nothing would be better than laying on the floor in a remote cabin in alaska, away from everyone.you are entitled to your opinion, and i’m not going to judge you, so i ask you not to judge me. i just want to know if there is anyone else out there who is in this kind of situation.tl;dr: move alongedit: i greatly appreciate the feedback i’ve gotten here. it really is true that even a match can bring warmth on a cold day. i’ll be taking some time to respond to some of the comments, and i hope that i can repay the favor in kind someday.
no job, no money, no friends, no family, no pets, no future.
hi guys, this is my first post. i think my post title sums up my life. i’m really struggling to see the point in life. i have always worked hard and have been self employed for nearly 20 years. in the last year or so work has dried up and i’m not much good at anything else. to compound all this i’m not a very bright guy and really can’t see the point in carrying on with things and can’t see a way forward in life.i’m not sure what to do as my depression has also recently wrecked my marriage but fortunately i don’t have any kids. i just need some advice really.  i feel very alone. i also have no pets as i’m not allowed them where i live. i literally have nothing.
i’ve survived suicide attempts
and so can you. you got this guys. i’m 26 and female and i will never think about it again. help is around the corner if you need it. that’s what hospitals are for. 
do i have the right to be depressed
many friends and family tell me i shouldn't be depressed because i have much more than others. yes, i am able to eat what i want daily and have lots of people who care and love me. but i just can't help it. so do you think i am just...like weak ? or do i have the right to be depressed ?  (sorry if i couldn't  convey my message exactly how i want it, i am not  a native speaker) 
do you ever just feel angry?
i woke up today feeling angry. angry at nothing and everything. i know i need to meditate and chill out and prepare myself for a busy day...but i just want to sit here on reddit and figure out my brain. i want to listen to music and to the birds.so lets all try to give ourselves a break when we start to feel upset, aggrivated and like you need to go run away/hide/jump out a window.breathe and remember that you are a strong, beautiful human being that can be happy.i have been trying to forgive myself as well as others today.i wish you all a peaceful day!&#x200b;
mr. positivity hasn't been feeling positive lately

this chill vibe has been helping me a lot with my depression. can post the link in the comments. i hope this helps any of you. all of you.

help with negative self talk
i just started therapy and this came up. even trying to talk about how poorly i view myself makes me cry. i get more embarrassed and want to run. i have anxiety as well and have to somehow return to therapy each week. anyway, i am struggling to turn off this negative self talk. i know i need to replace it but am not doing that too well. i have a parent who directly impacted the way i view myself and have tried to distance myself from them since learning about my issues with the therapist. aside from cutting off that source of judgement and negativity, what else can i do to work on this? what have you done to help shift your mindset. are there any books you’d recommend? or activities i can try?
music that i feel would help people dealing with hardships to listen to.
look up boyce avenue. the album is so perfect for the explanation of life events. from a bad breakup, feeling lonely, how not to be hard on yourself, etc. highly highly recommend. hope it helps people looking for some answers but don’t have the person there then to tell you.
currently victor over my depression. i’m grateful for the opportunity to be a support. just message me.
i found my hope in recovery groups and i do positive things on a daily basis which over time has made my life gradually less and less of a crisis. i know what it’s like in the place where nothing matters and i’m lucky to have made it out for now. i’m grateful for my blessings and i would be grateful to be there for you. just send me a word
feeling lost and weak
hi there, um, i don’t really know how else to start this, so i’m just gonna go, okay? okay.i’ve struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. or maybe not my whole life, it’s hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. car accident. nasty business. i was 12, i saw it happen. i think i’ve been broken ever since then.it got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. i went from honors student, “”gifted””, to dropping out of college. my brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. but i told myself it was all my own fault, that i was just lazy, selfish, immature. making excuses.i’ve seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. the stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help i got from them. any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best.i went through a really, really bad period about 3-4 years ago. i lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than i should. i turned to self-harm, it was the lowest point i’d been in my life. i still see the scars when i look in the mirror.but then i started to get better! i got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. i stopped self harming, swore never to again. even after getting sexually harassed by my (thankfully ex) boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, i kept it together...for about a year and a half.almost exactly one year ago i got hit by a car as i was crossing the street. physically i was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where i lost my mother. i started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point i was having full panic attacks ever single day.i knew i needed help, but i felt powerless to get it. i had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance. i wanted to switch to insurance through work but i’d already missed the cutoff date. i wouldn’t be able to apply for another year....i almost made it. but i was unspooling too fast. i ended up leaving that job before i could get the help i needed. but that was fine, i had enough savings to get me through a month or two, i could find a new job.that was, i don’t even know, three months ago? i haven’t even applied. i just...can’t find the energy. i know i need help, i know i’m really sick, but i just...can’t move. i’ve had the website for a local therapist open in my tabs the whole time (one that i can email, because holy hell phonecalls are an anxiety nightmare even when i’m feeling sane) but everytime i go to reach out i just get paralyzed by anxiety and uncertainty, and i just can’t find the will to muster through it. i haven’t gone back to self-harming but i’m so afraid of ending up back in that place again, it’s been a struggle. i just don’t know what else to do. i just don’t know what i can do?! i’ve been exhausted all day but i can’t even sleep. and i feel like i’m crying but my face is utterly stillfuck i’m sorry this wasn’t supposed to be nearly this long. if you read all that, thanks, sincerely.tldr: puppet with strings cut seeks life advice and/ or spare blue fairies

i imagine my suicide almost daily
hi reddit. i don't know where to start. but the fact i am here now writing this is proof to myself that something is wrong with me. i'm not sure if i should begin with my childhood and work up to now or if i should just flat out say what's bothering me right now. but more or less, i think about killing myself; at least once, every day. when i wake up first thing in the morning i feel a gaint rush of anxiery and dread over the fact that once again, i did not die in my sleep and i have to somehow live today. every night before bed sometimes i imagine my eventual suicide and i smile because i know that's probablly going to be one of the 'happiest' moments of my life. i get so nervous thinking about killing myself though even though the concept beings me peace, because i was raised unity christian growing up so i am worried i will go to hell if i do commit suicide. i also fear being stuck in 'purgatory' if i do commit suicide (which is almost just as bad as hell) if not considered actual 'hell' in some religions. i stay up at night fearing going to sleep sometimes as well because i have such vivid and intense dreams. i even dream about attempting suicide in my dreams and when i have those types of dreams i usually wake up and immediantly run to the bathroom to go vomit. what else can i say? i have ptsd from surviving an armed robbery at my work and i have survivor's guilt because i feel bad for surviving it and not being able to just go back to my ordinary life now.  (instead now i have ptsd and i fear even going outside to the groceey store. ) i feel guilty because the other girl that survived the robbery is fine and seems to be living her life and traveling and is unafraid (where as i have trouble even going outside period after what happened to me.) i feel like if i couldn't just bounce back and act 'normal' like her, that perhaps those guys should have killed me that night when they were pointing the gun at me to rob my place of work. so i have survivor's guilt but i also hate myself. i really hate who i am. i hate my looks. my voice. my choices in life. everything basically. i am a 22 year old female and i have thinning ultra fine brown hair that's not very thick at all and i am so self concious about my hairline and lack of thick hair that i don't even want to go out in public or even be seen because i feel so disgusting and ugly that i have had random teenagers point at me in public and make gagging noises over my appearance. i know i am not always ugly because i have actually modeled in the past. the thing was i used hair extensions and make up to hide my discolored anorexic looking skin and acne, and to make my hair look as beautiful on the outside as i felt on the inside.  then my hair started thinning out so bad that i couldnt wear hair extensions anymore and i am at the point where i should probablly wear a wig but the ones with realistic hairlines cost like $500 and i don't have that right now. my hair is also right now dyed this ugly ass copper penny color (auborn brown color faded) and my brown roots are large and they blend into the copper tones like an ombre but i know my hair is ugly. i went to cosmetology school but even i can't figure out how to fix my hair or make up. i thought i was alright at make up for a while and then i went back and really looked at my photos and that's when i started even hating my face with make up on.  i have gotten to the point where i hardly even wear make up because i know it doesn't look good on me. i just have an ugly face. my acne is bad and the make up doesn't hide it completely.  i feel like whenever i wear make up i just look even more ugly. like the make up is enhancing all my insecurities. i have stretched ears too and i know people think that shit is gross so i am self concious about the fact that people probablly take one look at me and judge me to be homeless based on my outfits/lack of nice hair and make up and name brands. so on top of my ptsd and depression and anxiety, i am pretty sure i have some body dymorphia thoughts affecting me and how i see myself. i actually don't like to look in the mirror for too long because i actually get depressed seeing how ugly i am. i just imagine myself to look better than i actually do so when i see myself and my true ugliness, i get dissapointed and i hate myself for even trying to pretend to be pretty. that's another thing that i suffer from: imposter syndrome. i suffer from feeling like a fraud or imposter most days. when i worked at different jobs like chipotle, and target, i still felt like any moment they were going to find out i wasn't really as great as they thought i was and they were going to fire me. i always fear people finding out that i have anxiety and then getting rid of me because of it. i try my best to hide it, but my ptsd is so bad that i have had to quit jobs due to my anxiety over being fired for attendence or something. i worry a lot. i compare myself to everyone else in the world and i think i am an imposter that is not as good as other people even at the things i love to the point where i don't even want to do the things i love anymore because i think i suck and that anyone can do it, probablly better than me. i used to have so many dreams and hobbies and now i just think i suck at everything to the point where i just don't want to exist because i don't think the world has any room for me. i feel like i don't deserve to live here on earth because i am such a loser. i feel like it is already too late for me and i will never amount to anything. i fear i will spend all of my life or the rest of my life in a mental hospital if i ever tell anyone these thoughts and feelings that i have so i try to keep it to myself but it's slowly eating me alive. i wish i could die. i don't want to be here anymore because i don't think i was ever meant to be here. i think some days that i was meant to kill myself. i feel like i am just another human taking up space and contributing to global warming. i just over all don't see any value to my life at all. i've let my depression and ptsd take over to the point where i don't sing anymore, write lyrics or draw or do anything i once dreamed of doing. i've deleted my social medias for the most part so i have nothing to do all day. i smoke weed and watch anime and that's how i have been spending my days but this isn't how i want to live my life and i know that but each dat that passes where i don't accomplish my dreams further puts me into a pit of dispair where i feel like committing suicide because it is too late for me to live my dreams. i worry i am too mentally ill now from what i have been through to ever actually accomplish my dreams and that concept alone makes me want to kill myself because i can already imagine myself being 80 years old and still watching anime and having no life and feeling the way i do now, and if that's what my future has in store for me, then i might as well just end my life right now. i don't have really any friends and i am too scared to go out and make them because i don't think anyone would ever want to be friends with me anyways because i am so nerdy and weird. i don't even know how to communicate anymore. when i go out to the store to get a sandwhich, i try to make small talk but i don't even want to do that. i don't like social interaction anymore even though i crave it sometimes from all the social isolation i have put myself through. when i say i don't know how so socualize anymore i really mean it. i go outside and idk wheather to make eye contact with people or weather to look down or if i should smile or not when i pass by people or if they think i am some homeless drug addict for doing that. i get so mentally stuck on what other people could be thinking of me that it makes it hard for me to talk to people in real time and keep up with their conversation or even know what to say to them and i worry that my face and eyes are giving away how scared i am to even be socializing and i worry it makes me vulnerable and an easy target. okay, now, let me add that i grew up in an abusive home enviorment with a narcissistic dad and narcisstic mom. they were verbally,  physically, emotionally and sexually abusive to me growing up and even now they are still abusive so when i see them on holidays it is very hard on me because they say such hurtful things to me. i think that's why i care so much about what other people think, because my own parents told me i deserved to be sexually abused because of what i looked like. i had rainbow hair from age 17-21 and a septum ring and my own parents said that that made me look mentally ill and easy to take advantage of and a bunch of other hurtful things. to be honest the rainbow hair was the only choice i ever made for myself that i actually felt was mine and it made me happy. i also did it vwry beautifully because i went to cosmetology school so it was really beautiful. i'm sad my hair is too thin to allow me to dye it anymore but i used to feel good about myself when i looked that way even though my parents hated it. looking back now, i still think i look ugly in a lot of different ways. now, i must also add that i have an eating disorder. i currently weigh 132 or so but i'm a size small in everything. i used to throw up every day multiple times a day and i weighed 94 lbs. that's when i got a medical marijuana card and that helped me eat food again and stuff. my eating disorder is anxiety related so it doesn't have anything to do with body image. i just feel so stressed all the time that it's hard for me to eat anything because i am afraid it will make me feel sick and i will throw up so i am pretty thin because i hardly eat and i am very self concious about my eating disorder problems and the health problems that come with it. i am now also self concious about my teeth because from all the vommitting my gums have been receding and i am afraid to even show my mouth smiling because i am so self concious that my mouth looks like a drug addicts mouth or something. i do smoke weed but i didn't think weed could cause gum problems or teeth problems. i'm afraid to go to a dentist and find out how bad my mouth is. i know i need to go, but it's just one more thing to add to my endless list of things that are now stressing me out. i am sorry to ramble on and to make this post so long but since i haven't been established with a therapist yet, i have no where else to vent this and no one to say this to. i have to let it out somehow; so here were are. anyways, after saying all this and seeing that this is my life, i feel like killing myself because i hate what a pathetic loser i am. i hate that i am not making music like i want to and instead i allow my mind to put me down so much that i consider committing suicide almost daily. i wish i could just get better so i can live my life again and make music and have my dreams happen. but i worry a lot that maybe my dreams were never meant to happen because i was born disadvantaged mentally (with anxiety and depression and phobias) i'm worried that because my mom and dad made me, i have their problems genetically passed to me and because of that, i am worried that some of my anxiety was passed down to me so any idea that i had growing up of me ever being a singer or an artist one day was foolish because i was born with the predisposition for anxiety so i was never meant to fulfil my dreams and me even dreaming them was stupid to begin with because people who are mentally ill like me can never accomplish anything/or it's extremely hard for them to accomplish things because their own mind is their number one enemy. that's basically what i worry/think/feel all the time and that actualization alone makes me want to kill myself the most because i feel abolsutely foolish and worthless. worthless from birth and foolish for ever thinking i could ever be otherwise. this feeling...all these feelings are hell on earth for me and i can't take it anymore. i have created a hell on earth for myself within my own mind and it is horrible. my own thoughts on myself are so self sabotoghing that i can't do anything anymore. i've lost interest in everything. all my dreams. all my goals. even hope of me feeling happy on my next birthday is dwindling. i don't even feel happy when i eat food, i feel depressed. i don't want to go inside a mental hospital because i know it will make me feel more sad and i won't eat the food there. i'll only eat the strawberries if they give them to me because i just don't like food. i know all this is affecting my health. i just don't know what to do about it. i already saw my doctor recently and she gave me a refferal for therapy and i am currently on a waiting list but my anxiety is so bad i haven't even called back to see if they can get me into an appointment. this is my life. it's shit. and i know i shouldn't be complaining because some people out there have it way worse than me so i feel like i don't deserve to have this platform to even tell people how i feel. i feel like i should just suck it up and move on but i can't.  i really want to just end my life already and stop taking up other people's time. if i've gone 22 years feeling this terrible i don't think i can survive anymore. i want to end my life but i am scared of going to hell if i do so. i'm not worried about hurting people by ending my own life. you can't convince me anyone (including my own family) would even miss me or really feel much pain past the initial shock of hearing my death but secretly everyone in my  family would be happy to see me dead because i don't think they like me anyways. i haven't talked to any of them in months,  some of them years, and i haven't seen friends either. i've been trying to make myself dissapear and fade into the background of people's lives for a while now. i used to be an instagram model until one day i realized everything about my life was shallow, empty, and meaningless and that's when i decided to just delete my instagram and fb...and myself. i don't think anyone hardly noticed my disappearing on social media because i had only 2 messages from people asking about it and those people don't talk to me very regularly anyways. i didn't have many followers on my instagram so i don't think anyone missed me much. i made this reddit over a year ago to post a story about how i almost was abducted into sex trafficking but it was too hard on me with my ptsd to re live what happened by telling the story again so i haven't finished my first post ever on the subject due to that. anyways, i don't expect anyone to read this post or even see it. i don't think anyone will respond either because i don't think my life is that valuable compared to other people. i bet there are people out there that will see this post as proof there is a mental health crisis in america and that i should just end my life already if i am already in this much pain. i guess what stops me from killing myself is the fear of 1. going to hell and 2. possibly regretting it because i could have changed my life and got better somehow and braved the storm. :/ those ideas hold me back but it doesn't stop me from wanting to end my life when i am faced with any minor setback. i hate that aspect about me. i wish i wasn't like that. anyways, i am sorry for making this so long. i wish this wasn't my life and that i did not feel this way but unfortunately, this is how i feel and i have to let it out somehow. i hope life can get better me. i hope i don't have to kill myself. i hope i can feel 'happy' again for a long time and have it be genuinley real. i hope i can get past this stuff and make my dreams come true but as each year passes i lose more and more hope that things could ever be better each time. i do not know how much longer i can take of doing nothing with my life. i'm sorry this post couldn't be happier. i'm sorry i exist. i'm sorry i exist at all. i'm sorry for complaining online and for doing nothing in real life to feel better other than crying. i'm sorry i am so weak and pathetic. i wish i could be stronger. i wish i didn't feel this way. i'm sorry.
expectations and depressive episodes
**this perspective has helped me with severe, sudden episodes: **ok. so your brain has decided to take a massive shit on you. fucking fantastic!don’t hold yourself to the standards of a functioning person! accept that the episode is happening, and accept that for a bit, winning may be just as simple as taking care of basic necessities or accomplishing a single, small task. giving 100% as a functioning person and giving 100% as a depressed person are *not* the same thing. we tell ourselves that we’re pathetic, weak, and not good enough, when in fact, were fighting harder than the functioning people, it just looks like less. im proud if you can keep your head above water, because that takes a lot of strength. trying in whatever capacity we can is enough. hang in there 
am i suicidal even if i know i won't kill myself?
sorry i don't usually post so this might be kind of sloppy. for starters, i am not going to kill myself. i care too much about other peoples feelings. and my cats. but all my mind can think of is how nice it would be to be dead. i've been depressed like this one other time in my life, but this is the first time i have seriously considered self harm-i guess as a way to escape the internal pain? i haven't taken any steps to self harm but i have a strong urge to do so. i just want everything to end. i have no drive to do anything. i'm irritable as fuck. nothing is going right and even if it was i probably wouldn't acknowledge it. idk how to get out of this mindset-i have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. i've tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologist's but its super fucking hard in this mental state and there's a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc.... my question is whether or not this is still considered suicidal, even though i know i won't end my life, i would just like to. anyone else experience this?
just wanted to let everyone know that in august i am 4 months depression free.

in case you don't get to hear it today, i love you!
as arbitrary as it sounds coming from some random internet dude, we all deserve some love. some piece of mind a feeling that we are not alone even if you feel that way. even if there isn't positivity in your real life, you deserve to be loved, so i love you, everyone have a blessed morning. try positivity and stay strong.
life just feels over and i'm only in my mid 20's.
i just don't know how to get the will to keep going. i've been through hell, and i have no blood family left. i know some people never know their real family, and i know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all saying just doesn't feel right anymore. i wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time i turned 25, that i had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. every paternal figure in my life has died. after my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my uncle. within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. after several similar occurences i've gotten superstitious about father figures. i have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. i want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but i just get so stuck and depressed. i feel like they should be enough for me, and i'm a burden by being depressed. i've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college i know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. if i hadn't inherited a nightmare i might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an rv) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. i look at them every day and cry, but i feel powerless to get out of here. i think there might be equity in the house, but i'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. i'm falling apart and i just don't know what to do. i want to seek therapy, but i'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than i can afford every month. i'm drowning in debt. i need to get rid of those cars, but every time i try, something happens and i can't get it done, then i get discouraged and don't try anymore. it makes sense that if i'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but i haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. i also know that if they look at my income it looks like i'm making plenty of money, so i don't think sliding scale would help. i don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. that scares me, because i've heard that described as passive suicidal ideology or something. i'm just so tired. i have no desire to do anything because i know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. i don't know if i can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while i work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. i don't even know what i'm looking for here, i've written this all in a journal a million times. i just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? i'm sure i'll get plenty of go to therapy comments. i feel so guilty sharing my feelings. everyone just says oh, it's so unfair what happened to you and i know. i wish i could stop feeling sorry for myself even though i really don't have it that bad in the grand scheme of things. i just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. again, i'm not going to hurt myself(i truly don't think so). i haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when i was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. i only attempted once when i was young. i know that i'm capable of getting through this, i am just in constant emotional agony currently. i generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but i feel so stupid and irrational. if you took the time to read this i appreciate you. here's to feeling better. thanks.
why can’t i cry/let out emotions
i (18m) can’t express any emotions and haven’t been able to for months. all i want is to sit in my room and just cry and i can’t for some reason. i’ve tried everything playing the saddest music i have getting drunk/high you name it. i just want to be able to let out all the stuff i’ve been balling up and i can’t. please what is wrong and what can i do.

even being awake is too much effort
normally on the weekend i feel ok but now i still feel exhausted. even typing this is hard. caffeine just makes me jittery. i just want to sleep.
i went to a new psychiatrist today
and i loved it.he made me feel so much better about my guilt.all my friends and family say that i should try harder, that are people out there with high functioning depression, and i have to make more of an effort. i always feel awful about that and i believe thembut he told me that this is a disease like diabetes, not all people have the same type of diabetes, and the treatment is not the same to everyone. lack of will power and extreme guilt are symptoms of depression, and there is nothing i can do.... except the treatment. as long as i'm treating myself, i'm doing the best i can. i moved to another country so i'm 1 year without therapy, and i just changed meds when i was visiting my family  during the holidays, i should have gone to a psychiatric here last month to check, but i didn't. he up the dosis of my meds and will suggest me a therapist.i treat my depression for 7 years, i heard that all before, but when everyone is saying the same thing over and over again it's easy to forget.if you have depression and are not being treated, you really should. that friend that said that had depression after the break up and cured themselves, so you also don't need a treatment? wasn't depressed, just sad. if you don't have money, you can find free help in universities or institutions, it may be far and a bit inconvenient, but is so worth it.it takes a while for you to find the right medication, but when you find it, the world changes. for real. and therapy is so important, i don't know how i survived 1 year without it. fun fact: when he asked me who told me those things about how i should try harder and that are people out there who has depression and still work and go to school, i said that nobody told me that.i don't know why i lied.ok, not that fun. i just want to encourage anyone here who is avoiding treatment. you should try it, please. it really does help. treat yo self
feeling unattractive makes my depression worse
what do you guys do when / if you feel unattractive? are my chances at getting people to be interested in me ruined?
if you need help, i’m here. i love listening and helping you all. you’re not a burden on anyone.
this has become a passion of mine. every time i see the red notification that shows me that someone hasn’t given up yet i get a dopamine rush. so lay it on me, don’t worry about being a burden. i’m always here.

they said this at their concert this wednesday and out came the tears. ❤️
beginning to get bad thoughts again
i found out yesterday that my aunt relapsed and is now only alive because of life support, and if this next test comes back negotiable they have to pull the plug, and with everything that’s been going on in my personal life, i really don’t think i can handle it, i need some help
i just need to put this somewhere
i really want to die right now and even the things that are going well in my life are bringing me nothing but distress. i want to die, i won't because i have a sense of duty to the people that it would hurt but.. i'm literally just going for the sake of going right now.
i'm at a loss (nsfw)
i guess i'll start from the beginning.i know i don't have it anywhere as hard as anyone else, but i guess i'm extremely weak.when i was young, my mom and dad had shared custody. my mom had me only as a way to try and trap my dad. (it didn't work, he didn't even want kids and didn't have any interest in marrying her regardless)when i was at her apartment, i would see drug use, a lot. of course i didn't understand what it was at the time but as i've grown older i know what was going on. she had a boyfriend named michael. he molested me periodically from the age of 4-6 (with her knowledge, she fucking watched). everything from before that point in my life is a gigantic haze. my dad knew something was going on, but i didn't tell him. (i couldn't, at the time michael had said he would hurt my mom and dad, and i didn't want anything to happen to either of them) i guess he decided enough was enough and gained full custody of me. shelled out the thousands of dollars he had to, to gain full custody of me. at that point i had a lot of emotional confusion, and feelings i guess?  i started getting in trouble in school, and had to be moved to species education in third grade for being hyper aggressive. i began counseling for my anger and for years didn't understand the point of talking about my problems. why talk about it, if i couldn't be helped i guess. i continually got in trouble in school, and by 5th grade i had been charged with simple battery. i would continue to get in trouble and be charged throughout school, would spend time in ydc. at the age of 13, when i was being questioned buy the sro when i was in handcuffs i finally caved and talked vaguely about my molestation. i had been trying to suppress those memories and when i first talked about it everything rushed back. the feelings and all. a fucking floodgate had been opened and i didn't know what the hell it was. a month or so later, i had taken all of my medication and tried to end my life. i guess that was the first time i fully had and understanding of wanting to die. i had to have my stomach pumped and went to a psychiatric facility for 24 hours after i had been sent there from the hospital. i wasn't up front, i was so disgusted and intimidated by being there that i told them i did it for attention and they let me go. mind you, i talked my fucking way out of that place in 24 hours after ingesting all of my medication.at my hearing for another battery charge a couple months later, i was ordered by the state to have a psychological evaluation or i would become a ward to the state. so i caved and went through every detail of my molestation over the course of six hours. i felt so disgusted with myself, i wanted to die even more than when i had taken all of my medications. i went into the why me? phase. i was mad at the world, mad at god and to this day i still am.the psychologist had diagnosed me with ptsd, depression, anxiety, separation anxiety, insomnia, and auditory schizophrenia. the fucking rollercoaster just kept worsening because i had finally talked. why? there was no benefit, talking was pointless. so they began intensive therapy and trying different medications. at that point, i was back in school and fighting more, because somehow kids had found out. being called a fucking retard is one thing, but people ridiculing me for what had happened made me angrier. that's when i fully understood what schizophrenia was. only one person had said anything about my early childhood, however it was almost like it was the whole class, i had gotten into a fight and was arrested. when sitting in a holding cell, waiting for my dad to pick me up i genuinely realized that the voices were in my head. i decided that i didn't want to hear anything and began slamming my head against the wall and had knocked myself out and given myself a concussion. when i had came to and was going to the hospital; i fully understood what was wrong.it took a couple of years, and at the age of 15 i was starting to mellow out. then, i realized that i only had one testicle. my grandmother had taken me to the doctor and it appeared that my left testicle never descended. i had surgery and had to have it removed. the doctor ended up telling my dad that it was blocked by scarring of some sort. which i don't understand unless it came from my molestation.i came to from my anaesthesia, and they asked how i felt. i only asked about my teste as dumb as it sounds. when they told me they had to remove it i sobbed my ass off, and they gave me some strong medication for sleep. this is when i understood how selfish my father could be. because of my emotional stability they wanted me to rest so i could be monitored, my dad told me you can't go to sleep, we don't want to get caught in traffic. traffic, traffic of all fucking things. so i fought through whatever they had given me and they decided to send me home.fast forward to 16, i had woken up a morning before school and had it in my head that i wanted to die. so before i got on the bus, i had eaten all of my adderall, the hydrocodone i had saved from my surgery, my respirdal, lamictal, abilify, and whatever else i was on and went to school. i figured it would have killed me before i had actually got to school. i got to school and staggered off, and fell down. they helped me in the school and could tell something was wrong and called my grandmother. the nurse told her to check to see if i had taken something as i was showing signs of overdosing. everything is a haze, but apparently they made me vomit and no medication they could tell came up. so i went to the hospital and they pumped my stomach. everything for the next few days is a haze and i went to a psychiatric facility for a week. that's all my insurance would let me do, i decided i wanted help, only for my insurance to limit it. whatever, i got out and they altered my medication. they had managed to get the voices for the most part to stop, but i was dealing with everything else the best way possible.at the age of 17, i graduated a year early and my insurance lapsed as i was no longer in school. i had to use what i learn to keep everything from worsening. i haven't done anything since, i'm 22 and have been unmedicated the entire time. now, and i don't know why now but everything has substantially gotten worse in the last 3 days. i can't afford help, i don't have insurance and i'm so fucking close to blowing my brains out. i don't know what to do, i can't figure out what i can do and i'm just alone.if anyone can give me an idea of what i can do for immediate help, i'm in georgia. everything i've looked at tells me to go to the hospital, but i can't. if i go, i'll lose my job, my apartment, my truck. everything, i need help but now that i want it i can't fucking get it..
sick of everything
i hate to post stuff like this on the internet but fuck it i guess.i'm just sick of everything, i want to live life to the fullest but there seems to be something always in the way of it, like intrusive thoughts that just mess with me. i try to ignore them but sometimes they seem stronger than me.and today, to make matters worse i just received my first test of the year (i'm in high school btw) and i was very disappointed with my grade, which makes me depressed because it makes me feel like i'll never be anyone in life. in the past i've always had good grades but i don't even know anymore. i just seriously hope this phase of my life goes away.
regret is suffocating
how do you deal with regret you spent the best years of your life  (18-25) just crying? i didn't really have a lot of fun then. i just focused on passing school.what sucks is that only now i realize what i could have been. i had horrible self-eestem issues. i couldn't even look at guys i liked. i only got a boyfriend now, but it really bothers me that i have no experience with love and now im in an age where people around me look to settle down while i only really am just discovering what relationships are like. it's like im only now going trough puberty when i should be getting serious. soon i won't be young anymore and i feel like i never really experienced what 'young' is in that carefree way of self discovery
i think my friend is about to give up, and she is distancing herself from the people that can help
so i have this friend,she is my best friend,she has depression and is in a real bad spot right now.we both finished high school last year,and she thinks she is driffiting away from our friend group,yesterday she blocked all of us on twitter,i think i am the only one that noticed so far,and she has been saying things like, no one can help me, or i don't think they like me and i feel nothing for them,i am trying to convince her that it isn't true, that they do like her, because i know they do.i have always been doing the most that i can,trying to be supportive and saying stuff like, i am here if you need and things like that,but it isn't as effective because i am currently living in the other side of the planet for my studies,(we are both brazilians but i am doing an exchange program in canada, if you care)after i confirmed that she blocked all of us, i told the situation to 2 other close friends of her, and they didn't know how bad she was until now.so i'll just ask a few questions to anyone that cares to answer:did i do the right thing telling the situation to other people??is there anything else that i can do??is there a dedicated sub for people that aren't depressed but want to help friends that are??sorry for the formating and spelling mistakes, english is not my first language, i am on mobile and i am feeling a little bit desperate about the whole situation.
first study to explore what it's like to live with avoidant personality disorder:“safe when alone, yet lost in their aloneness”

i lost a job that i like and i am so depressed. i’m finding it hard to recover. i’ve lost interest in everything. i am over 50 already and at this age, it would be hard to get a job. i can’t sleep well at night. it’s so hard to accept i am always crying. i don’t know what to do.

i did something scary and created a short video of one of my meltdowns. i then show the steps i use to feel better. :)

i sent a message to my father...
on 6th february, 2019 at 4:47am i watched my father take his last breath on his bedroom floor of my childhood home. to say that things moved on quickly is a severe understatement. right now, it's 3:35am and i have been awake for the last 95 mins just wanting to hear my father's voice. to know that all that i'm doing for my own family is enough; that i'm not a failure as a son or as a husband or father. sure, my wife tells me that i'm not a failure, but it's not the same. i just want to hear my father's reassurance one more time. &#x200b;i can't find a voicemail or a video. not a single one and it's crushing me more and more. so i sent him a message on facebook since i know his cell phone is long disconnected and his number more than likely recycled. i'm sure my mother will read this as she is the one that has taken over his account since his passing, but i just really want to hear something attached to his name or his face right now.&#x200b;i'm sorry if this isn't the proper place for things, my mind has travelled back to that morning when i was getting ready for work and i get a phone call that something has happened to my father and that i should get there quickly... sometimes i wish that i could be more open about these feelings with my own spouse or those close to me rather than random strangers on the internet, but i still feel like i need to be the strong one. not only for my two children, but for my 5 older siblings and our mother as well.
if you're depressed watch this

passively suicidal
i feel like i’ve been passively suicidal since a very early age with moments of being actively suicidal. what i mean by this is that i’m pretty much wanting to die at any moment but not always to the point of actually doing anything about it. i can’t live like this anymore. i know it’ll still happen occasionally, but i just want some time where i don’t wish i were dead. i don’t know my dudes. i just feel so lost. edit: i really appreciate all the support. it’s nice to feel not alone. i hope you all know i support all of you too. edit: i’m looking for a new therapist so hopefully i can find a good match and start the process of coping. i’ve previously had a couple (one moved, one was a complicated situation and i had to leave after she failed to report that i had been raped and i was still a minor). i have major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder following being raped at 16. 
depression getting worse, can't get treatment soon, and going broke
long story short since escaping an abusive parent that financially supported me i've been jobless and i'm running out of money (don't worry i'm not asking for any money, just advice). this is a time in my life where i need to double down, try and get a job, and get my shit together. because if i don't i'll literally won't be able to pay my bills and live, right? well that last part is certainly true. but ever since three months ago i've had a terrible depression (and also symptoms of ptsd) and it's been getting worse. i always feel empty, unmotivated, and tired. things i used to enjoy i don't anymore. i don't really feel much of anything lately except for emptiness, boredom, and sometimes anger. i'm 100% certain i have ptsd and depression but can't get a diagnosis until i get an appointment with a psychiatrist and that'll take a month with my free public health insurance. so not only am i not able to function with my depression with things like eating and sleeping let alone job seeking, i'm in a situation where i can't immediately get help *and* where if i don't get a job within the next month i'll be fucked. is there any way i can cope or did method i can do to get myself mentally sound enough to get a job, at least until i can get the treatment i need? i'm just do overwhelmed and i don't know what to do. thanks guys.
ex gf was my life, now what's the point?
  i posted my story on another sub for some support. feel free to read it…it’s long. i am just feeling very depressed today. depressed being an understatement. she was my world. we were going to get married and have a life together. had our kids name picked out. she told me she couldn’t imagine her life without me. now she’s posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. he’s a loser, no job, no education, can’t support her. i would have given her the world. she threw away 7 years together and all our love and memories for a guy she had only known for a few weeks. it kills me.she doesn’t love me. she’ll never come back to me. what’s the point anymore? i don’t care about having a good job or having “a lot going for me”. the one thing i want in life i can’t have. her. she was my everything. i don’t want someone else. i literally don’t care about anything in my life anymore. i hate everything. i hate myself. i lost her. i treated her so well but it just wasn’t enough. and now she’s gone. i don’t know what to do. i just wake up, go to work, go to the gym, go to bed and repeat. every day is the same and my partner is now happy with someone else. what am i supposed to do? i feel broken. thanks in advance.
year 23 of wanting to free fall off of a cliff
i’m so sick and tired of being alive, every year it gets worse and worse, i think about wanting to kill myself every day at this point. i feel like i’m stuck there’s no chance for me to ever get better, i don’t have the money to move, and i also don’t have a car. no friends, no family to go to, this all feels more like hell and i’m ready to just go and never come back.
what keeps me going
i know it sounds babyish, but pokemon really keeps my spirits up.world of warcraft, diablo, osu!, overwatch, music, and many, many other things keep me happy.pokemon is something i can just dl and emulator for or play online. something that i could do on my phone. world of warcraft is a game i've played since bc since my father started playing when i was born, it's a game i have memories with and have so many good friends i've known for 6+ years because that's when i had the confidence to talk to people. and they're around my age! we still talk but can't play together because my computer broke :( i find joy in videogames, and nature. i know this is horribly structured but it's just something i needed to say because i know my irl friends would judge me
i feel so lost, i don't know how much more i have left in me
i'm a 50 year old male with a 10 year old daughter (shared custody with the ex).  i spent most of my life as a high functioning person and was always in the top 10% of the population income wise.  i've had issues (depression, eating disorders) since i was a kid but i was always able to handle it and stay high functioning.  then, over 6 months, i lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.  that was it, i had no strength left to put up my front and i dropped quickly into a deep depression.&#x200b;well 5 years later i'm divorced, still unemployed, completely broke and barely surviving financially, have panic attacks when i try to job search, and have zero confidence left in myself.  i feel like a total and complete failure in every aspect of my life.  i even feel like a horrible father because some days i can barely handle the normal stresses of dealing with a young kid and i give into her too often which is leading her down some bad paths health and habit wise.  almost all my friends are gone.  my supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when i was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   she decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because i must always have been a secret narcissist.  when she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  other friends i wasn't as close with disappeared when i was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  they decided i didn't care or wasn't worth it.  some just didn't know how to deal with me when i was always down and they had known me as the up guy who was always there to support others.  &#x200b;i have nothing left.  there is nothing inside of me.  i want to die all the time. i've been though treatment.  3 doctors, 2 hospital visits, multiple drugs, tms treatments, ect treatments, day therapy programs, dbt/cbt training, anything they wanted me to try i did.  nothing.  i move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  what joys i get last only for a few minutes before i go dead inside again.  my latest doctor when i showed some optimism about trying to change said its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.  i can't live feeling like i have no purpose but leaching off of society and not even having enough to do the things that are important to me.  no money, no job, no friends, what's left?&#x200b;the only thing that's held me back for the past year is my daughter.  she's 10.  she is all that matters to me.  i don't want to desert her, but i often question if i add anything to her life anyway.  and its hard to live for every other week with someone especially when those weeks can be so hard mentally.  &#x200b;i don't know why i'm writing this except to vent.  the truth is i don't think its will i kill myself but when.
i seriously considered cutting myself last night.
my depression comes in waves, but last night was especially bad. i can't properly describe it, but i could not stop crying. and this happens almost all the time. no matter what i do or how i distract myself, the pain always comes back. it's why whenever i get done with a walk or finish doing something fun, i start crying again. i think it's getting worse. nothing i used to feel better was enough anymore. i wanted to take a knife and carve the ache out of my chest, but it doesn't work that way.so i thought about cutting myself. i always wondered what it would be like, but never seriously considered it until last night. i even went as far as getting a knife. i got scratched by my cat before so i figured if it was anything like that it wouldn't be a big deal. and cutting supposedly took away from the emotional pain, so it would be worth it. i ultimately didn't do it. mostly because summer is coming, and i'd have to wear short sleeves. also because i chickened out. i would like to say i'm proud for not doing it, but i'm mostly just upset and angry. i'm tired of this. as hard as it is living with depression, i never understood why anyone would want to cut. now i do.i know no one will care, i just wanted to get this out.
being the boyfriend.
my girlfriend and i have been dating for almost 6 years. she has suicidal thoughts occasionally. she tells me i am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes i don’t think i’m giving the best support. (sorry for the long post. i don’t know if there’s any other sos in this thread or if there is another sub i should be posting in) i don’t have anyone i can talk to about this. after about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. after a long silence we both cried and i told her how much i loved her. she told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn’t want anyone to know, so i’ve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom i share anything and everything with. so thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all i got. over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. but we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, i think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - i’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that i’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. i’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. we both have hpv so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. i feel like she’s not telling me something. i feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. i get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which i highly doubt she is, i think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. most of all i feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. i honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; i’m certainly not entitled to anything and while i know her story better than anyone i have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. i don’t even know how to explain how i’m feeling. i’m constantly having the internal debate: “well what about me?”- “fuck about you! what about her!?” and so on. while writing this post i kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.headspace a: “that being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? i’ve really never been an attention seeker so i’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? anything at this point. it’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.”headspace b:“a few weeks ago while i was alone doing laundry i just started hysterically crying i couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. nothing like that has ever happened to me before. earlier that day she had called me crying and saying “she just wants it to be over. she just wants to give up. she wants to die” i love her so much and i’m scared for her and for us.”am i just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? i feel like a prick even saying that. of course i’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and i want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. so i don’t say anything, instead i just get distant, which i recognize and i hate that i do that. i’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. i want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. how can i help this relationship? how do i bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do i bring it up at all? thanks so much for any help.edit: i meant to include this in the post and a lot of you have asked. she is currently taking medication to help with the anxiety and so far it has been working pretty well i think but she still definitely has sad days. her doctor said if the meds don’t help then she could put her in touch with a therapist. also taking any suggestions on the best way to find a therapist. gf is hoping to get one recommended by the primary dr so it is covered by insurance. 
how do you get back into the working world with severe depression and anxiety?
i’ve been out of work since august when i had a major breakdown and attempted suicide in september. i’m on new meds and back in therapy. i want to find something part time and ease myself back into things but i find myself panicking at the thought of human interaction outside of my small circle. i’m able to mostly go to the store, run errands, etc without a panic attack now. the depression is better but still bad. but i have such a hard time functioning normally (smiling, responding appropriately, etc.) with the public that idk how i’m going to manage a job. but i hate not working, not providing for myself and my kids, and i need to find a job again soon. 
for anyone with depression, anxiety, low self esteem who struggles everyday...
i want you to know you are not alone. i think about suicide a few times a day. i don't have a tight knit friend group, just one-on-one relationships. i have trouble connecting with people as i am always worried what they think. i am overemotional, sensitive and have very low self esteem. although i feel like giving up... alot. i do not want to. i do not want to harm myself and let the last thing i do hurt everyone that loves me. life isn't about being perfectly happy all the time. let the pain rush over you and do not fight it. once you allow yourself to feel it, you will begin to heal. fear and paranoia consume my life. i watch others live in peace jealously, but every once in a while i realize they struggle too. find something that makes you happy and do it. don't compare yourself (as much as you can) sending you love and support. 
i'm so afraid that i've messed everything up already
... and that i can no longer make something of myself anymore. for a little background, i'm a man in my early 20's living in a country where a diploma pretty much makes or breaks your future. from a very young age i was already pegged for success and things were going well but the problem was that as i grew older i just became more and more depressed. 2 1/2 years into a pre-med course, i met some like-minded individuals who also weren't happy and we decided to fuck everything up. a failed suicide attempt and a whole semester out of school later i went back to uni now in an english course which screwed me over after 1 1/2 semester as they changed the curriculum and required me to go back to freshman year. i lost the courage and the patience. i've been out of school for a whole year now and i've been faking it to the people i know by editing my grades on the internet. now i've fallen out of touch with my parents because i've disappointed them too much and i'm stuck in a joyless career which is neither meaningful or helping me grow. i also have a girlfriend who means the world to me who's older and is taking her doctorate. she's expecting me to finish anytime soon, get a real career and finally settle down. i feel like everyone's expecting something from me that i can't deliver. i've done fucked up so much that i don't even know where to begin fixing things. honestly, i don't even know what has kept me going. back in late 2018 i attempted suicide. before 2019 ended i promised that i won't reach the new year. but oddly enough i'm still here but i'm afraid i might finally burnout. i haven't sought help since my attempt since it was the meds that i tried to do it with. i just wish my future didn't revolve around a piece of paper so much or at the very least i wish i was able to do things right the very first time around.

is it okay to drop a class for the sake of my own health?
so i am currently in college. i am in my second semester as a freshman (first year) and i am an undecided major. i was leaning towards computer science or graphic design, but this cs170 class is stressing me out. the class by itself doesn't sound too bad. but thinking about the homework, which the professor warned could take up to 6 hours outside of class to complete, is what stresses me out. when i think about my other classes like religious studies, world history, geology, and design, i don't think i can handle the work load of cs170 plus the workload of the other classes. i know that this is a stupid request and will probably be removed, but i'm the kind of person that relies on advice before deciding something important like this. any advice could be helpful. please and thank you.
my depression has been beating a retreat for the past 22 days, but i fear she's resting and gaining strength to try to take me back down. she better be ready, i'm fighting.
after 2 years for severe depression, and denial of said depression, i decided to try to use all the tools i've gained from therapy and pop psych.part of me is getting worried since i've been relatively okay since 2019 started.  bit of sadness, self hate and regret crept in.  thinking of ways i could've been a better daughter to my dying mother, and sister to my dying brother, and friend to my dying ex-boyfriend and more attentive to my dying father...i was able to force myself out of that doom and remember all i did do.  i forced myself to remember what friends, family, co-workers, and other people said about my devotion and love.my depression is such a playful, cruel and smart bitch.  it's fucking exhausting to battle that cunning cuntface.just want to encourage everyone here to keep up the fight.  be in your own corner.  take care all.: )
this is what my depression and anxiety look like... i hope this shows you, you are not alone.

my parents are a major source of my desperation/ thoughts of s**f h**m and i have no idea what to dotw: speaking on s*****e
hello.  i’d like to start by saying i’m not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit for this and will happily remove if incorrect. so i’m m 23 and ever since i was a kid my parents (mainly father more recently my mother. well touch on that) have been a large source of my mental health issues. i’ve discussed this with them multiple times and was constantly told “other people have it worse” or when i break down in tears from everyday life being told “ he’s a grown man crying what a cry baby”2 months ago i attempted to take my life and was put on short term disability until i was approved to longer be at risk to the company i work for and myself. it’s the only time i’ve felt they’ve taken the matter seriously until i found out that my mother has been talking about it to her coworkers and other family members without asking me first. so until i manage to find an apartment to move into i’m stuck with in a house where i don’t even feel welcome in anymore, and have begun to distant myself to the point where all i say is “okay” to any sentence and avoid conversations. i do see a therapist and things are going smoothly. i’m just at a lose on how to tell them they’ve been a large cause my problems. not to have them take fault. but for them to understand they’ve done this and to at least attempt(?) to be “better” in the future thank you
i don’t want to be alive anymore
i would turn to someone else, if everyone i knew didn’t absolutely hate me.i tried therapy. i’m bad at talking to people. i get scared by talking to adults, despite nearly being one myself. i tried being honest with the people i love, but they all say that they’ve had it worse. i’m not exactly someone that’s easy to get along with, either. i’m loud, obnoxious, and god, am i stupid. so, that means that i don’t really have anyone else around to help me, because my god-awful personality drives everyone away.i tried. i really tried. but, trying wasn’t worth it. i’m just so tired. and every day leaves me more exhausted. i just don’t want to feel like this anymore. i’m trying one more time, to reach out for support, i mean. i really could use some support, maybe someone to listen, and not make fun of me for everything going on.just someone to be there for me would be nice. i’m sorry, i’m really dumb.
no point on living like this anymore i can't stand loneliness anymore.
this is really ruining me. i hate myself for being the way i am. a shy introverted guy like myself has no future in this world full of predators ready to harm other in the pursue for success. i really wish i could change how i am, i'd really like to have that common thing wich is the ability to talk to other people and make friendships and getting good jobs and (hate to admit it) have a sex life, i don't even have a sex life, and maybe i shouldn't say that because that could get me labeled as  a creep but whatever, i'm already labeled like that by other people i guess, or maybe i'm just paranoid, i hope so.anyway that's the thing. i wish i could change it but honestly i don't want to get hurt in the process. haha my god. grow up kid!
the magic of medication
i feel comfortable watching the rain.my medication has gone up and i am starting to notice its positive effect. now i only struggle through the side effects, but that is a matter of listening to my body .
antidepressants withdrawal side effects
i've been lowering my meds under doctors supervision, stopped taking all meds for about 3 days now. i've experienced a lot of side effects in the past few years since i had started my treatment but this is very bad.i know there will be side effects after i stopped taking long time meds but it's pretty heavy that i really need it to stop. massive headache and dizziness. i feel like i'm slower than i normally am and i feel like i need to throw up every time right after i eat something.is there any tricks that could ease this suffering?
friends,thanks for your help alot but today i will end my life
 hi im 22 year old male,who his life right now is seriously fucked up,and the thing i keep fucking it and making it worse cause im so fucking dumb and retarded i wish i never existed to be honest,i mean instead of doing my homeworks and studying for my exam i spent hours and hours watching porn or using cat fish(pretending to be a female,see how much of aloser i am?) account so i can speak to people,nobody love me in real life,i always wonder how does it feel to be loved how does it feel to wake up knowing someone is thinking about you,im so much of a failure,i used to be that bright child who loved to help everyone,but that person died,and depression is fucking me every single night,he's making my life hell for me i can't fucking continue its too hard,i know that i am a coward,but i tried everything,yet i failed,bye world
does anyone else ever get to a point where they feel emotionally detached from even the most important people in their life?
like, i've never felt so empty or so bad that i just don't care about anyone or anything anymore. i can't even bring myself to see or talk to my bf, who has been my greatest support this year. it's not that anyone's done anything, i just can't feel anything except a crippling emptiness that makes me want to disappear. 
how do i tell my friends and family that i am depressed?
i am 21 years old, i’ve been dealing with depression ever since high school but never discussed it with anyone until this year. last semester i visited my school’s counseling center because i just felt so shitty. my depression comes in waves, so it comes and goes (which is partly the way i’ve been able to hide it for so long) but when it’s bad i spend hours just convincing myself to shower or brush my teeth. i feel so unmotivated and unhappy. i finally saw a counselor and explained everything i have been feeling and she suggested that i see a psychiatrist. i really want to because i don’t know if i can get through another episode and i feel one coming on soon, but i don’t know how to tell my mom that i need to see one. i am still on my parents insurance plan so they will find out regardless. i just don’t know how to tell my parents or my friends. i don’t want to come off as lazy or sad and i definitely don’t want them to treat me differently.
i am sad, alone and scared.
i’ve never been properly diagnosed with depression but i am currently feeling very depressed. a few years ago when i was younger & my parents were going through a divorce i was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety & often contemplated ending my life. it was a sad time in my life but i am glad to say that i got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. however recently i have been feeling really down & depressed. all i want to do is sleep and i eat because i am sad and bored, and then i become sad because i eat too much. i have gained weight and am so insecure. i have been skipping my uni classes because i have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. with all my friends heading in different directions i just feel so alone. i think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but i know they mean well. they think i have obsessive compulsive tendencies because i tend to pick at my face often & struggle to stop.i just don’t want to let anyone down & i am afraid to take the steps to become better because i know it will disappoint my family if i decide to leave uni for example. but most importantly i’m scared of going back to how i was years ago, i never want to feel that way again. i’ve never reached out for professional help either and don’t have the money for therapy. part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if i got professional help. i hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and i hate the idea of having to take meds. i just feel so lost and conflicted. i feel like i know what i need to do but it’s so hard to do it and remain consistent. if anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. also, thank you if you read through it all.
i’m always depressed
sorry not really a confession but i just feel so sad and needed to get this off my chest.i’m only fifteen but since i was eleven i have had depression and anxiety for months at a time then i would feel better and positive for ages, but then it comes back and i feel like shit everyday, i cry so much over anything for hours. i cut my thighs to try and feel better, now i have urges to cut every time i feel super anxious.i feel extremely anxious when we go to peoples houses just because of the thought of having to talk to them, i never talk to our family friends because i’m scared of being ridiculed and i just don’t know what to say, mum thinks i’m just being shy, and every time we get home from outings i cry in the car and then cry myself to sleep when i get home. i just cry and hug myself in the fetal position while my breathing is really fast and i pull at my hair, i think it’s anxiety attacks. now i just isolate myself from any social situation possible, including school, i’m barely passing because my attendance is so bad, i fake sickness to my mum when i’m anxious to get off school.i have only like four friends at school and i would never want to tell any of them about this and none of my teachers either. i feel like i can’t talk to anyone i feel so alone and worthless. on my birthday a couple days ago i cried all day and slumped around the house because i felt like i wasn’t worth celebrating and wasting all the money my parents spend on me.i feel like an asshole and i like i just let everyone down. i don’t know what to do but i don’t want to tell anyone because i’m so embarrassed.
just some positive comments to those who need it
to those of you feeling down, just remember that this period is the time to really reflect what you really want out of life. this period is the period that will make you, don't think of this as a negative, actually think of it as a positive, you will thank yourself in the future. you are not alone so don't worry and the right people will come to you, you don't need to worry about anything. 
has anyone ever had the feeling...
... right in the middle of your chest, it feels like a light switch has turned off and you suddenly don’t feel like doing anything?

the recovery letters

i’m drowning and i don’t know what to do
sometimes i think that maybe i don’t really know what i want. i hate it. i hate how i look at other people and hate them. i hate when they smile, i hate when they laugh i hate how fucking happy everyone else is. i’m being left behind. i know i am, everyone is so far ahead of me and i’m drowning in my own damn mind. i can’t keep this up. i can’t keep smiling and pretending i’m cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that she’ll feel bad about ten minutes later. i don’t think i want to die. i just... i want to be free. but maybe freedom is death for me. i want to hit something. i want to yell and scream but at the same time i just want someone to hug me and tell me that it’s okay and that i matter. but that won’t happen. not in a way that’s genuine and real, it’s all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. if i’m alone then maybe it’s better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. no one would really care if i go. i give them three months tops until i just become a distant name they remember every so often. everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why can’t it stop i want everything to just fucking stop. i tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. they read straight off a damn script. didn’t take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what i needed to get out. i don’t know what to do anymore. i feel like this my final chance to ask for help before i go back into a hole i may not be able to escape from again. i don’t trust anyone and those few that i do hole a level of trust for i don’t want to burden them so i smile and play it off as some edgy joke. i need help but i don’t even know where to start.
my self care plan, and i'd appreciate some further advice.
hello everyone,i'm a 26 year old woman and i suffer from depression. i'm in therapy and on antidepressants. i attempted suicide in april 2018 but, since then, i've made a lot of progress and i'm quite happy with myself. but loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. tomorrow i'll leave for another city because i have to participate in a public competition for a workplace (i'm in italy so, in order to work for the government, you have to participate to public selections). problem: i don't know anyone in this city so i'll be alone for seven days. yes, i'll meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day i'll return to my hotel room and i'll be alone. and i'm very scared. this is my self care plan, that i organized with my therapist:\- focusing on the public selection;\- bringing my favourite books;\- netflix for the nights;\- going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food\- visiting the city in my spare time \- calling my so and/or friends if i really feel overwhelmed do you have any other advice? i'm a bit anxious. thank you!
i'm alone.
i'm lost. i'm afraid. i'm worthless. i have no one in my life anymore, bar one friend who lives on the opposite side of the world. i lost my boyfriend yesterday. he broke up with me because my depression was bringing him down. i understand, i guess, but the last thing i could ever have wanted or needed was my boyfriend to leave me, he was my rock, and he cheered me up even on my worst days.i have no family. they never wanted much to do with me, especially when i started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. they slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways.i have no friends. i moved into university and left my friends at home, and i really struggled to make new friends here. i have one, my flatmate, but that's it, no one else wants anything to do with me. i'm even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, i can't stay here at uni. i have no one left. i have no reason to live anymore. i've fought for so long, and surprisingly, i think i can say i'm currently at the lowest part of my life, and i have gone through and done a tonne of shit.i don't know what to do anymore.
this is why i don’t reach out to people. this is supposed to be my confidant and best friend who knows i’m seeking professional help on a regular basis.

i have no purpose in life anymore
i have hyperacusis since a year now. it was managable at first. i even had an hearing aid to recude sound for me when it is too loud. with it i could go almost everywhere without being bothered by sounds. i had setbacks by accident i had with sound. i have seen a lot of articles about it, succes storries, ent... i wanted to document myself about it . so i knew or should know that it is serious. i passes a lot of test that were all positive. so the only thing i had to do was  taking care of me, wear my hearing aid as much as possible and try to live the most normal life i can because time was the best thing. the only thing i couldn't do at that time was listening to music . but one morning i woke up a little nervous. and i begin slaping my hand against my legs and increased the intensity like i'm stupid. and unfortunately reinjurred my ears by mistake. now after months it didn't improved, i'm stuck in the house, i can't listen to music or watch tv... but the biggest thing i lost is hope. i love music so mich i was hoping i could get back to it even if my ears needed years. i don't want to live like this anymore. i'm just surviving now because of my stupidity. i hope i make sens about how i feel. my all purpose in life is now unreachable forever.
is it worth trying more anti-depressants?
hey everyone,my depression has been out of control over the last year. it's always been bad, but this was the first year where i woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. i've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time i've been talked into anti-depressants several times. and without fail none of them helped. prozac, solexia, welbutrin, and another i'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. this past year i tried effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and i felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. now i'm very apprehensive about even trying another ssri/snrias of a few days ago i made one last try at maybe getting the spravato treatment. but because i live in the world's richest third world country(the u.s.), all of my prior ssri experiences mean nothing. the insurance company requires that i endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that i pay them for.has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? i was given a list of more modern snri's and i'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and i'll give in and do it.
i can’t take this anymore
i can’t take this suffering anymore. everyday feels meaningless and miserable. i don’t remember who i am, the past few months it feels like i’ve completely lost myself. i look at photos of me and don’t even feel like it was me. i don’t feel connected to anyone anymore, including myself. my mind says awful things everyday, and it’s like i can’t get it to stop. i can’t think normally anymore. i don’t laugh or smile like.. ever anymore. i don’t find things funny. i’m sad and lonely. i feel like there’s no hope in me getting better. another thing i’d lik to add is that with all of this i feel like i’ve lost my imagination. i can remember vivid images of things i’ve seen, but coming up with something myself feels impossible. it hasn’t been like this before, i’ve always been creative and had a great imagination, but now it just feels gone. i feel so hopeless and useless. i don’t know what to do. i feel like i’m slowly giving up, i cry everyday about how i’m feeling and the traumas that have happened to me. i can’t stop thinking about how things could’ve been different if i got help and told someone how was feeling when this all initially started. i need help but i don’t know what to do. i just want to go back in time and do things differently. i feel weak. i feel like smiling or being happy makes/made me weak. loving anyone or anything made me weak. i don’t want to think like that though! when i was in love that was the happiest i’ve ever been. so that doesn’t make me weak.. right?
26yo male just want someone to listen
i’m sorry i just need to tell someone my story and what i’m going through. right now i feel like i just can’t keep up the act. every day i wake up and dread all the things i have to get done, and think of the people i’m going to have to talk to. all i can think about is how there doesn’t seem to be any path or course of actions i can take that will lead to any type of long term happiness. all day i fake smiles and tell jokes, but really i’m just counting down the hours until it’s over. about 5 years ago i tried hanging myself, but somehow my brother knew and found me and cut me down. i then spent a month in a psych ward and got a therapist etc. we tried a bunch of different medications over the next year but honestly most of them made me feel worse and none really had any noticeably positive effect. i tried cbt and all that but i just couldn’t buy in. while dealing with all of this no one ever knew, except my family and a few very close friends after i tried to kill myself. after i got out of the hospital i had to live on a friends couch for a while because my parents said “we think you’ll do better if you live on your own” but really they just didnt want to deal with me anymore. i got a job at minimum wage and worked my way up to manager and got my own place within 6 months, and things were ok for a while. i then ended becoming partners with the owner and opened my own store, and things were ok for a while, but i couldn’t be sober at night, i’d have to smoke or drink or my head would go right back to where i was. but over the past few months everything is turning grey again. i have to force myself to shower and to brush my teeth and most days i just can’t. i can get so much done at work, but i can’t even do basic things to take care of myself. i feel trapped. i want to end it so badly but now there’s employees who count on their paychecks and are barely making it as is. i’ve starting cutting and burning myself again which helps numb the pain a little but i just don’t know if i can go through this again tomorrow. thanks for listening to my boring story, hope you’re all doing well
my fear of failing is stressing me out and no one seems to care
so i’m in high school, where i barely find the motivation to consistently work for good grades and keep them up and my family doesn’t seem to understand that i’m trying to do well and every time i get even one question wrong on a test or i mess up everyone tells me that i have to do better and that i’ll be stuck without a good job or good future and it’s honestly terrifying and i’m constantly under stress. i’ve joined a bunch of after school stuff with important commitments (5 out of 7 days i’m at school from 8am to 6 or 7pm, sometimes even later, the other 2 i use for homework and finding a time to talk to my friends) in order to make my family happy, and they’re actually treated like a job(sometimes i get paid) but all i’m ever told is that i have to get a “real” job.  i’m sorry for the rant, i’m freaking out, any advice is welcomed.also sorry that this is difficult to read since it’s in one paragraph.
why am i so lonely? (sorry but this is actually tied to my depression)
i can't understand why i feel so lonely all the time. i guess my depression made me push everyone away and everything but i don't understand why i'm always so lonely. any suggestions as to why? all responses are appreciated.
i'm happy
i made a post awhile ago about my situation and wanna update that i'm dropping out of school going full time and i'll be much more happy

thought i’ll share this here too. take care everyone ❤️

i wish life had a reset button
i feel lost and aimless. i have goals and things i want to do, but my decisions over the last years have pushed me away from the career i now realised i want. making a change now feels nearly impossible, especially since i'd like to migrate. (increasing xenophobia across nations, pending drastic resource shortage, yaaaaay)i am struggling and finding opportunities that get me closer step by step but i can't help but dream of how things could have been had i made better decisions. even the decisions i'm making now, though they feel right, i'm terrified i'll regret the also. and i'm making a commitment on this, a step that is interdisciplinary between what i've been doing and what i want to do, that i'd hate to break. i am losing faith in hard work and efforts. i feel like i'm stuck dealing with the consequences of my mistakes, in choosing the wrong field, forever. which is probably true.
my depression multireddit

i got sick of online mental health chat services so i made a better site called mellowtalk. it helps people work out problems by incentivising good listeners
hello! my name is benjamin, i'm a highschooler from virginia. a little while back i had some serious problems with depression and many times i used the chat service blahtherapy as a release by helping people on the weekends. however, in the past couple months the chat quality has dropped severely and i find the site is often overrun with bots or trolls. it really seems like they are putting all their effort into the online therapist portion of their site and leaving the far more popular chat aspect as an afterthought.after a couple weeks of this i decided i could do better myself so i made the site [mellowtalk](https://mellowtalk.com) to replace the platform. my site is also for the purpose of mental health and is free with no ads, forever. it pairs listeners and talkers in one-on-one conversations with the talkers being given the ability to give the listeners points if they feel like they are doing a good job, making them ascend up a leaderboard. all names are silly and randomly generated and refresh at the beginning of every chat making things totally anonymous and safe. inbound and outbound connections are also heavily encrypted so i promise there is complete and total privacy. i designed the site based on what i wanted and i only hope that other people might want it too. i didn't have anyone to talk to and i don't want anyone else to have that experience.it's a very small site right now. very, very small. and totally community funded, so not exactly profitable. that said, if it seems interesting please check it out because i think it has some good vibes going. i'd love some feedback and for questions or concerns, leave a comment or send me a pm and i'll definitely get back to you. thanks for listening, take care.i hope this can be posted here, i want to be clear that my goal is not solicitation.
has anybody ever felt like that?
hi everyone,i don't know if this is the right sub for this and if not, i'm deeply  sorry because i know there are people here who are in pain and need your help more than i do.let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. my father is a history fan, especially ww2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. the next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.but...i feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? is that really all there is to life?am i to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?so i guess what i'm asking is: has anybody here found the answer to that question?ps: sorry if that doesn't make sense, i can only put words on it when i'm drunk so it doesn't always make sense.
going through hell atm
i am the worst i have ever been in a long time. my cat has been missing for almost 5 weeks and i feel dead inside. i dont know where he is, if he is alive. he was my best friend. on top of that i am already depressed. i don't even have enough energy to cry anymore.i have cleaned my room, done a rerun of my favourite tv show, and i don't start school for a fortnight... my next psych appointment isn't for another 3 weeks.. and i don't have any friends to comfort me.i feel like i am suffocating in despair, i don't want to be conscious. i have spent the whole of june sad and right now i'm so stressed i feel nauseated and panicky.no idea how to calm down or numb the pain. :(what in gods name can i do to feel okay, i am on the verge of a breakdown.
i’m having a really hard time
i’m really struggling maintaining my will to live. i’m tired of everything. and don’t want do go through everything to come. i recently went through some therapy through my college. my assigned therapist was a practicum student and last week was our last session together after this entire semester. i feel very empty now.my mom lost her brother to suicide and my best friend lost another one of her good friends the same way. seeing first hand the way it affected them keeps me going but that feeling is diminishing. i’m just so tired of everything and i have no motivation or energy to do the simplest of tasks. when i think of my future it seems like such a long road ahead of me and i don’t want to do it. i’m really struggling. i can sometimes see a future for myself and my career but at the same time that dream seems so fantasized and that i’ll never make it
this is my 100%
this is my 100%. if you don’t like it leave. this is all that i can give. appreciate me for what i have to offer and don’t expect more of someone who is drowning inside their own brain. i refuse to be the girl who caters to a mans every need. appreciate me for what i have to offer. appreciate my brain. value my compassion. this is who i am and this is everything i have to give. if you want more you can find it elsewhere. someday, someone will want me. they will appreciate me for the person that i have become and love me for my strength and flare. but right now- this is all i have. if it isn’t enough then walk away.
depression ruining concentration
i am a college student, and i am really struggling with depression and anxiety. recently, i have noticed that it's become very difficult for me to concentrate during my classes and while trying to do my homework. i just don't have any sort of attention span anymore. i'm lucky if i can pay attention and take notes through half of an hour long lecture. i know that lack of concentration can be a symptom of depression, but i haven't brought it up to my therapist because i don't know if it's because of my depression or just because i'm not trying hard enough to pay attention. am i just using my depression as an excuse to not pay attention in class? 
being alive is so weird.
about 2 days ago i felt like killing myself and it's all i could think about. but i didn't know what to do, i worked on my appearance in the meantime. complaining the whole time in my mind that i'm not pretty and it doesn't matter what i do i'll never look good enough. i made my hair so soft and silky and straight and it still made me sad. then i continued and did my makeup something i haven't done in years and still i felt stupid. after all that i was still alive and went to work and had a good day. i still dont really know what i want but somehow just doing my hair and makeup was enough of a distraction to keep me alive. i hate this but i guess it's okay. i still feel kind of hopeless and lost it's kind of crazy how we can find distractions from ourselves. 
i hate facebook.
it makes me feel like crap. every photo of parties that i am left out of is a like a sucker punch to the stomach. even though i know if i were invited, i would probably have to decline because of kids anyway. but it would be nice to know at least i mattered enough to be invited. guess all these people are not my friends after all. and that just makes me feel even worse. that i have no real friends.fuck you, facebook.
in a world of my own...

i feel anxious about going back to college
winter break just ended and i have to go back today. i’ve been feeling down the whole last semester. i have one last semester left before i graduate. i feel empty inside and i feel like i haven’t done much fun stuff with college. i’m 22 and still a virgin/never been in a relationship (although i have been kissed but that was at a parties/clubs by strangers, and very rarely, so meaningless), and it’s eating me up, because i feel like no one wants me. the few girls who i got “close” with (and by close i mean talking) turned me down, and last semester i got friendzoned by the girl i liked. i have no clues how to date or how to initiate intimacy. all of my friends have had sex/dated and i feel so left out. i’ve lied to people about my lack of success just so i don’t get mocked.i’ve been underweight most of my life too and no matter how hard i try i can’t seem to put on weight or bulk up. i’ve never been athletic and don’t have anything to show for that. i’m also not an interesting person, or had any interesting life experiences. i don’t have enough money to travel, and don’t really have any unique hobbies or skills. when i was in high school my parents were very strict and never let me go out, which i feel has socially stunted me. i don’t know if i’ll get a job after graduation (despite being in a decent field) and when i return home i feel like i’ll be stuck at there neeting and working minimum wage jobs. two of my closest friends have got jobs laid out after gradation.i know when i graduate i’ll be miserable.
a note, from me to me
  apologies in advance for how long this is. i’m not honestly not even entirely sure why i wanted to post this here. i suppose i need to say this somewhere that seems a bit more real than just my brain. somewhere i can actually hear myself say it rather than just let it go on loop in my head, until all the words lose their meaning and the whole thing ends up drifting away from me like an empty boat aimed at some dark shadowy place out of sight. i’m just afraid that if i don’t really try to say this properly, then it’ll go to that place and this moment will be just one more thing i let float away from me. and i suppose this whole post will probably be as self-absorbed and over-described and rehashed as i’m worried it will sound. probably even more than that. but i couldn’t give a shit anymore, because more than afraid of what i’m going to sound like, and how i’m coming across, and what people might think of me, more than any of that, i’m just tired. and i’m sad. and i want to get off this ride i’ve been taking myself on for way too long. and i know that probably sounds like a pretty ominous start to a post on a subreddit filled with some pretty ominous posts, but don’t worry, it’s not going to be like that. this ain’t gonna end with someone needing to call an ambulance. not fucking today. but first, an intro.if you ask me on any other day, i’ll say i see myself as a basically lump of a person. as a meat sack. i imagine myself sometimes as like a piece of soft and sagging flesh, like the human equivalent of that part under the arm that jiggles when you move. and my greatest fear is that i’m going to sit on this couch and waste until i eventually kill myself, or until the world moves on and i’m left sort of stuck here in my own pocket of time. and then i kill myself. and honestly, a lot of the time suicide seems like the best non-solution i’ve got. it’s the one i understand the most. because where suicide is a small and easy full stop, the other option is something really long and complex and so impossible to understand from where i’m standing that it starts to looks as if there’s just no way it’s possible. that it’s basically beyond me. and this is where it gets really tricky, and this is the part that i need to say to myself. but, before i do. i need to stress that this is not at all meant as a comment on anyone else here. y’all keep doing what you need to do to keep those chins right up high, and don’t let anyone tell you that you aren’t doing otherwise. because i’m certain everyone here is doing absolutely everything they know how to do to be and get better. so don’t let this little rant of mine feel like another voice of criticism, this is really just a conversation between me and me, one that’s been a long time coming. but anyway. back to rant.from what i can see of myself, the real guilt and shame of it all is that there are definitely things i could be doing. tricky, complex things sure, but still small and manageable things i can do every day that i’m simply not doing. that what feels to me like barely managing to stay afloat is actually surrendering one inch at a time. that what i’m really doing is buying into the depression paradox that i can’t unfuck myself because i’m already so fucked up that it’s going to be impossible to even try to fix it. that i can’t fix my own problems because i’m going to fold when it gets tough. and then, when i do fold, i’m going to cry and hate and blame myself for folding and then use the whole cry/hate/self-blame experience as fuel to beat myself up so bad that i can feel like justice has been served for giving up. that i’ll punish myself on behalf of the depression so it can trick me into feeling justified to say “stop! please! i’m already in so much pain, why are you making me do even one thing more.” a sort of you-can’t-hate-me-if-i-hate-myself-more strategy. and therefore i win. or the depression wins i guess. it wins by having me prove to myself that i’m useless and feckless and that clearly the whole thing is not my fault because when i try to fix myself, i end up being in so pain that i have to stop, and so clearly the whole thing is because of some inherent quality i’ve got. that i’m fundamentally weak. and therefore, that there’s no point even trying.and this is where the truly evil part occurs, the real grotesque sharp-toothed evil-eyed element of this whole thing, because then i get to believe it. because i want to believe it. because then i get to vindicate myself. i am no longer pathetic, a wastrel, not doing enough to help myself and unable to do anything. instead, i’m damaged. deformed in some way that’s just too hard to pull apart. which is bullshit because i know this is just what the shitty black tarred side of my brain wants me to believe. i know what it wants more than anything else is for me to buy so deeply into its power over me that i start believing it is me. that i start doing its job for it. and i’m so fucking done with it. i am seriously **so** fucking done with it. let me just say that again.i.am.so.fucking.done.with.it.i’m done with this pathetic vagrant type of life i’ve been letting myself live, this habit of settling into something and then immediately looking for an exit strategy because i certain it’s not gonna work. i’m done with dipping a toe in and letting the depression convince me that it’s too cold, or it’s not the right colour of blue, or that it’s just not the right time of the year to start trying to fucking fix myself. i’m done with doing the depression’s job for it. and so this is it. this is my promise to myself. i am going to make the depression fucking work for it. and if it wants to kill me, it’s going to have to kill itself first trying to figure out how to do it. i am not its fucking slave. and here are some other things i’m going to do.i’m gonna keep going to therapy, even if some days it feels like it’s not doing a fucking thing. i’m gonna keep going. i’m gonna stop letting the depression tell me that i’m fundamentally damaged. it’s not true. there are, for sure, a lot of things i need to work out, and i’ll do it one step at a time, but i am not incapable of taking those steps.i’m gonna stop beating myself up when i go for one of those steps and miss. i am not going to punish myself for missing. not only is that not fair, or even realistic to believe as being possible, but it’s just plain unhelpful in trying to get back up again.here are some other things i’m going to do.i’m gonna mediate more. i’m gonna exercise more. i’m gonna attend to my thoughts more honestly. and, more than anything, i am going to learn how to live for the sake of fucking living and not for the sake of just surviving.that’s it. rant over. i’m going to put on some shoes and then go have a smoke outside and try to see if there are any stars out tonight. then i’m going to go to sleep and wake up and try as hard as i can to remember how i feel right now.

i can’t do it anymore

help with bf and low sex drive
i take several medications for depression and anxiety and they have a serious effect on my sex drive.  there are times when it's practically nonexistent, and times when it seems normal.  my problem is my bf.  we've been together almost three years and i've never been happier.he is amazing.  he's sexy, smart, funny and so sweet and caring.  i love him so much, but i worry.  his sex drive is so much higher than mine and i'm scared that i'm going to lose him.  he's not the kind of guy who would ever cheat, that's not my worry.  what i worry about is him getting frustrated in the bedroom because of my low sex drive.  i guess what im asking is, are there other ppl out there who have this issue?  how did you resolve it?  i enjoy sex, especially with him, i just, i don't know how to approach this.edit/updatehad a very long talk with my bf as many of you suggested.  he was super sweet, and supportive, i was in tears of course.  he promises me that he feels like we are fine, and my sex drive isn't an issue for him.  he also said that if i ever felt pressured he was sorry.  so i guess all my worries were for nothing.  thank you so much to those who were supportive and offered real advice.  
seeking advice for working with depressed partner
 hi all,i've been dating a really wonderful woman (mid 20's) for about half of a year that has been depressed for the last couple of months.at first she was mostly quiet, tired, and sad, but she was responsive enough to tell me she couldn't hang out because she wasn't feeling great. i understood that she was isolating herself, so i gave her space and tried to be understanding. we still saw each other once or twice a week, but we communicated a lot less.now she's becoming more irritable, less responsive, and frankly not very nice to me. i've been taking the mean comments/criticism in stride and talking with her as if what she said wasn't mean. but it's beginning to take a toll on me. she's also shut down affection/intimacy for the last month which has made me feel less close to her (but i understand that can disappear). she also asked for more space this past weekend (which was an easy thing to say okay to, being that we're not even seeing other very much right now).i think i need to have a boundaries conversation with her so that i can outline that i need her to try to be less critical of me, to talk to me about what i'm doing that isn't working / what she would rather i be doing, and to talk to me about why affection has died between us and what we could do instead to maintain closeness in our relationship.could somebody give me feedback on if having a boundaries conversation with her would be a good / bad idea?thank you!
will i ever be enough for someone?
hello my fellow redditorsi'm new to this sub and i've recently had my heart broken by someone who i thought was the one, but at least she was civil enough to tell me now instead of 3 years down the line.a bit about me; i'm a 23 year old male father of one and  i suffer quite badly with depression and anxiety, prior to these events i've been feeling lost and the occasional thought of suicide or self harm wasn't out of the ordinary, i struggle as it is on a day to day basis i'm currently under the mental health team here in the uk.i'm reaching out for help from anyone who will listen, this is my last cry for help.
why do i keep losing friends?
i’m convinced everyone hates me i’m so worthless and stupid and ugly and undesirable all i do is complain and be sad and hurt but even the people who “care” about me just leave me it doesn’t matter who no matter how sweet i just scare them off idk why but they just block me and ignore me and even some make fun of me i just want a friend i just want to feel wanted
i have let myself go, how can i get myself back?
update: i brushed my teeth this morning. i am incredibly touched...like, actually crying (nothing new there!) by those who took the time to respond and offer suggestions and words of encouragement. i also saw some of you who could relate, please feel free to message me at any time...i always feel better when i see there are other people who feel the way i do because depression can be so isolating. here's to all of you, and me brushing my teeth again tomorrow <3  throughout my youth i was always considered pretty, i had a lot of friends and an active dating life. then, about 5 years ago-i had a major depressive episode, this lead to medication changes, which led to weight gain. in the past 5 years, i've gained 100 lbs. i can't remember the person i used to be, she seems so far away. it's almost like i've lived two lives, the then and the now. sometimes i sleep in so late, i end up leaving the house without brushing my hair or my teeth. i know what i need to do and what i should do to fix this all, but everything just seems so far out of reach. i guess i will begin by brushing my teeth tomorrow before i leave my apartment....
my grandmother is starving herself to death.
my grandmother (90f) is starving herself to death. she definitely has depression, which i have also (i suspect i got it from her...). her sister starved herself to death five years ago. she weighs about 60 lb at this point. her husband tries to get her to eat but she refuses to eat more than a few bites. she threatens to slit her wrists and has been threatening it for 30 years. what can i do? this is weighing on me so much. i can’t stand seeing her waste away. i feel like she has so little time left.
if you tend to feel fatigued, depressed or in pain, try boosting your vitamin d levels
according to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306) from several years ago, 41.6% of adults in the united states are vitamin d **deficient**, which means high likelihood of feeling fatigued, in pain, and depressed. especially if you live in areas with low levels of sunlight, or work in a corporate environment, your vitamin d deficiency could be contributing to depression. if you're unable to find time to go outside and get natural vitamin d, try taking 1000 iu of vitamin d supplements each day. i noticed a radical change in my mood when i did. hope this helps. 
how to be productive when depressed?
i simply don’t care enough about life, no drive no passion etc.  so how do i find the will to do stuff? it feels like there’s a barrier between me and productivity. i don’t know how to explain it but i feel terrible as soon as i put in effort in anything
i don’t know who i am
i don’t think i’ve ever known. i realized that my personality is just a collection of traits that i’ve absorbed from people in my life. idk maybe that’s standard. i don’t have any hobbies, or talents. i don’t know what to do with my life. all my past relationships i realized i was just being used as a placeholder until they found the better choice. i was never someone’s favorite person. i’m easily taken advantage of—i’m too nice. i’m lost. i guess i feel empty and hopeless. i feel like i have no purpose. i feel like a waste of life, like a disappointment. compliments don’t effect me, and i never believe them. i don’t feel real emotions anymore; i’ve gotten damn good at faking them. i’ve felt like this for too long. i don’t want to do this anymore, i want to end it all. the only reason i haven’t done anything bad is because i guess i have family that loves me. i don’t know why they do though. i don’t trust doctors at all so the thought of going to therapy is scary. sorry. i guess i just needed a place to rant. it’s late. i can’t sleep but i wish i could, and never wake up. 
help me :(
what to do when nothing seems to work? everything is so sad, nothing seems to have a compelling reason that values ​​life and makes me strive. i just feel like giving up. :(
how to coexist with depressed people (by someone with chronic depression)
maybe a throwaway? i don't know. i'm depressed (have been managing it with increasing success over the last 10 years) and this post was inspired by this recent post in the sub: [https://old.reddit.com/r/depression\_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody\_likes\_you\_when\_youre\_depressed/](https://old.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody_likes_you_when_youre_depressed/). please feel free to add your own suggestions, these are the ones that came to mind for me. 1. don't tell us what we're capable of doing or have the potential to do. we're already doing our best. 2. providing love and support for us where we're at is the secret to getting us to function better, but sometimes even support doesn't counteract a really hard day. be okay with this. 3. stop giving us advice on how to become less depressed unless we ask for it specifically. see #2. 4. before you say that we are perpetuating our own bad situations, remember that you are missing several factors that create a person with depression: environment, income, home life, schooling, abuse factors, etc. 5. if you are involved in a power dynamic-oriented relationship with us (parents, bosses, etc.), you are the last person that should be pushing boundaries or forcing us to go outside. but you are the first person who should be ensuring that you aren't pushing us too hard. 6. people who don't want to take pills are not making excuses. concerns about ssris are not unfounded, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits with their doctor/psychiatrist. 7. we're not always sad. sometimes we're angry. sometimes we're numb. sometimes we seem completely cheerful and normal and hide all of our symptoms as best we can. 8. sometimes we *do* make it much worse with our own downward spirals and negative inner-talk. telling us this does nothing to solve that problem. refer to #2. 9. therapists - get extra rest. take care of yourself. do not take on too many patients. be sure that this is what you really want to do, because people are counting on you to truly care. be careful how you talk about people's mental health situations, because your compassion fatigue can and will rear its ugly head. 10. if you're sick of us whining about our problems, it means you need a break from whatever is stressing you out and shouldn't be trying to support anyone's depression. take a vacation. go on a date. focus on yourself. 11. if you're close to us, ask if you can do specific things to help (if you want to). offer to make food, clean up, or run errands on a bad day. maybe all we need is someone to sit next to or a hug. maybe we need some time alone. maybe we finally need a ride to a counselor's office or hospital. ask. 12. don't support us in the hopes that your efforts will fix our depression. it's something you have to be willing to accept without expectations of anything changing. we may beat depression, but some of us take longer or will continue to struggle with it our whole lives - if this makes you uncomfortable, that sounds like a you problem.
hey, i just joined reddit and wanted to share something i just wrote. maybe someone likes it.
it’s a party. i haven’t talked to anyone yet. my boyfriend asks me if i don’t want to say hi to some people we know. i tell him to wait until i have my third glass down. three is my lucky number when drinking (that’s how many glasses it takes to make me go from totally social awkward to social butterfly). after that, i even go to the toilet with a girl i know.as i am waiting for her, a glass in each hand, a girl i saw some times in school walks up to me. “hey girl, i haven’t seen you for so long! how are you? haven’t you been to school lately? must have been some months since i last saw you. is it true you’re dating dave?” i don’t know her name, but thanks to the drink in my hand, it doesn’t matter. “yes, we have been dating for some months now. you look mesmerizing tonight!”i go out to meet my boyfriend again. some time later the same girl, which now has a name, anna, sits next to us and starts a conversation. i slowly open up, of course because of the alcohol, but she really seems to want to be friends. so, we hang out all night. we exchange numbers, talk for hours, dance and even ‘drunk-girl-friend’ kissed sometimes.i get tired, we walk home. i couldn’t say bye to her. in the morning, i write her “i hope you arrived home safe”she says “yes”i say “i’m really happy for that”she never answers.my boyfriend always asks why i can’t talk to people and why i don’t even try anymore. i used to not really understand that myself, but now i do. the more you open up to people, the more it hurts when they don’t open up to you. the more you care about others, the more it hurts when they don’t care about you. i know it shouldn’t make me so sad that i girl i hung around with once doesn’t care about me, but i can’t not care about people i like. and it seems i like pretty much anyone.
i lost my will to live a long time ago, i've done my best to get through it doesn't get better.
i only felt like living when i was with my ex. everything had meaning, it seemed like there was a purpose to life since we were together,  and if there wasn't well i felt content we had each other.  since he left 2 years ago now,  i've tried to move on,  act like i can do it on my own,  my heart isn't in this life anymore,  everything is dull and boring knowing he is gone.  i've also cried and cried and felt the pain my heart feels, i live with a heavy heart everyday. i can't stop loving him,  missing him,  wanting to be with him.  i look back and remember when i felt i had found that something that was always missing,  and now it's gone,  i've lost that spark.  i really don't think i'll ever truly get it back.  i think i will forever just remember those years as if they were some fantasy,  and now i live in the harsh reality of human existence and have been and will. the truth is i have lost all faith in all the things people tell you like time will heal it,  stay busy,  do things you love,  feel the pain and let it out,  i've done it all,  and still have a heavy heart that wants nothing more than to be with him.  i will continue to live life but nothing can help me,  this is just the way it is for me now.

my interview about my journey with depression with millennials path

couldn't get out of bed for christmas
i should start by saying i am lucky enough to have people to spend the holidays with; for those who didn't i am sorry. i don't understand what's happened to me. i have never been a confident or particularly happy person but this is the first time in my life i can honestly say i hate myself. i opted to stay home yesterday rather than spend the holiday with my family at my sister's house for much the same reason i opt not to do most things: i feel as though my presence there will dampen their good time or they won't have as good a time because they're worried about the weird sad guy in the corner. this morning i woke up to a pitted guilt in my stomach for being so selfish. this series of events or some version of them seem to be cyclical and occurring more and more frequently.  i don't know what to do....
i couldn’t physically describe what my depression made me feel to those who didn’t understand, so i made a short film about it.
hi everyone,my name is nick casaletto and i’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 12 years now. i’ve seen therapist, been on countless medication and have the support system of an amazing wife. but, my depression would always creep up unexpectedly, as i’m sure a lot of you can relate, it’s not exactly fun. my only outlet has been movies. since around the time i started to notice my depression at around 18 years old, i found myself sitting in my bedroom and finding solace in cinema. it was the only place i would feel comfortable being myself, my only escape from the world. after all of this time, my depression has matured with me. what started out as something i dealt with by countlessly drinking until i was black out drunk, to my now current quiet depression. the kind that makes you stuck in your thoughts that’s on a constant loop. i thought, (loving movies and having become accustomed to the craft of editing) why not make my voice heard. not as a cry for help, but for others who feel like me, and can relate to the visual medium. please note: the short movie is to a song that really inspired me, i was blessed enough to have the licensing and support from the band. i hope some of you will watch and relate.

chronic depression sufferer going through a crippling exacerbation...amazing how much a simple change like using a clothes line instead of a dryer can help elevate one's mood. i blame it on the act of getting out of the house (and bed), & feeling the sunshine on my shoulders. what are your tricks?

two depressed people in a relationship
i’m really struggling and need some support right now.  i’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  we’ve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  i tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  he, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.the depression started creeping up beginning of september.  at first it was subtle, and i was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  but now, it’s manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  i can’t even joke around and be fun anymore, because i consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  i’m misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  and i’m constantly battling between my intellect and what i know (he’s depressed, it’s not a choice, he doesn’t mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he’s withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because i am wrong, and he’s not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).the major difference between us is, i have a support system.  i have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that i use to keep me in check.  but lately, i can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.he says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though i know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).and it’s also screwed with our intimate side (which i think is a lot of the source of ire).  sex is important, but my partner’s well being is of course more important.  i am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he’s been so down, we can’t connect on that level.  i have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  a previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so i am on high alert.it’s really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory.  i am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.
does medication really help?
be honest
it hasn’t been this bad in a long time.
i’m feeling down. and i keep letting myself fall down the rabbit hole of despair, nostalgia, and fear. i suddenly realized there’s this giant void and nothing can help it anymore. i miss things. people. who i used to be. what life used to look like. nothing seems to matter anymore. i’m getting therapy set up this week, but i just need as much help as possible. thanks friends 
i am broken and have never been this low before. i thought i was hurt after my dad died but losing a person you thought you’d spend your whole life with is next level. i just need someone to talk to.
it’s weird how one day you’re talking about marriage and a family and the next the person is gone. i just need someone to talk to so i can know if i’ve truly given my all to this situation or if i can do more. the hardest part is accepting what you can and can’t change 
read this today and thought these are words to live by for me

i turned on the camera when i wanted to die hoping people could relate

i’m sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed, but i just hope this helps at least one person. my cat always comforts me in my toughest times, even now when i’m really struggling. there are good things in this world, even in all the bad. please remember you aren’t alone.

those who’ve dealt with it longer than i - how?
so i’m a 20 y.o. f who’s currently on her sophomore year in college. i was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. since then i’ve dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. since starting school i’ve realized i’ve become incredibly isolated. the only time i’ll have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day i won’t have a conversation with anyone.  even my parents don’t talk to me everyday. i’ve joined a dnd group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? my depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself i got a 3 month old puppy that i’m training to be my service animal. honestly, that baby is most of the reason i get out of bed as puppies don’t care if you have depression - they need to be trained. i’ve also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. i also got in contact with a therapist but i honestly don’t see how it will help much being as though i can only go to one session a month. i just don’t know how i’m supposed to live like this? like is this going to be my life from now on- just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if i failed miserably? i just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals- how did you survive?
i feel my life is worthless, i'm ready to end it all, please help me. i've posted for help, and i don't know where to turn to now. i feel more depressed now than ever before in my life.
i've posted about my current situation in other subreddits asking for advice, people don't believe me. i don't know what to do. my posts get removed, i do not know why.here is my situation, i posted about this on tifu and other subreddits.throwaway account. this did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. please reddit i need your help, and advice. please!i've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. at times i feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here tallahassee, in bum fuck florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, i hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where i'm coming from. working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one i have to make due with, but i guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house i pay for like i always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. she began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again i would go to her, try to get it on like i had done before, and i just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when i was looking to get it on with her. but this pattern, this taboo purgatory i now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. not only did i now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where i couldn't even relax in peace like i used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure i found being with her. i had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything i had to our family, and now this is the thanks i got. she would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like i hadn't, when she knew damn well i was exhausted after work at night times. so i decided from then on i had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances i now faced.inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release i well deserved; after work i began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, i instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where i was, that i was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. at those clubs i had the time of my life. it became like an addiction to me. for weeks upon weeks i'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, i didn't just savior my time there i indulged in it, there i'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. for some reason during this time i was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did i ever think i as a blond ass kid from pensacola would i be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time i'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time i just didn't care. during this time i met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her mandy, and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. we grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon i grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. i even took several business trips to her place during this time. every time i went it was well worth it. at first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. finally for once in my life i thought i had found the perfect work life, sex balance. i'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. and finally with mandy in the mix, i had someone to actually connect to when i wanted. unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, i've seen garbage fires that look better than her. mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. but that's when everything went to shit. mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. she took a test, and showed me the results. i don't know what to do, i can't let my wife, or kids find out. mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. she has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. she tells me she doesn't want to be just the other woman. she doesn't want to be a dirty little secret. i don't know what to do. i got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. i haven't been going to work for the past few days now, i've been making sure mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, i'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. i can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. i need your help, please, what should i do? i need help, and advice. i want to save the marriage, i can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. i hate this whole fucking situation. i hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? how can i convince mandy not to tell my wife? i don't know what to do, should i get a restraining order on her? please help me anyone, i don't know who to go to for help.tl:dr had several affairs with women i met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife!please help me, i don't want to live anymore, i'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. where can i turn to? help please anyone. my life is worthless. i feel numb inside.
i feel like i'm failing in life in itself and it's serious.
i've always had a lazy streak but have worked years. i got laid off around a year ago. i guess i'm depressed because i can't get back on track. i'm very shy i don't like being around people even though i have been but now i dislike it even less and i'm not even looking for a job i'm just living off what i saved for years. and i don't go out much actually i've been like a hermit for almost a year so i was wondering if anybody actually was like this as well? i'm so embarrassed of myself.
it was a challenging week for me. my faith have been put into test. nevertheless, i didn’t come this far only to come this far, my faith is made perfect in my weakness & no matter how hard it will hit me, i will always stand up hundreds or a thousand times , even if i have to do it alone!

the idea of self-love is absolutely preposterous to me still.
i've been in various forms of therapy for most of my life, and yet still, the idea that i should love myself still seems just absolutely preposterous. *why* should i love myself? i'm an envious, bitter, hateful, very unwell person as a result of what i've been through in my life, and the notion that i ought to love what i am is just ridiculous. i get that it's like a snake eating its own tail and that loving myself could reduce my negative personal qualities, but i struggle seeing anything lovable about me whatsoever. i've done positive affirmations, i've written letters to myself, i've hugged myself at times even, and i've written out list after list of my positive attributes. nothing helps make the idea of loving myself at all easier. anyone else struggle with this?
if you want to talk to someone, i can talk

if more people talked about mental illness less people would die.
 my depression was triggered by the death of my father and ever since i    have been on a roller-coaster of emotions. help get word out that it is    okay to have a mental illness and share your story. i use my blog to   share the experience and to help others by letting them know they're  not   alone [https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com](https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com/) 
if anyone needs someone to chat to, i’m here : )

after years of issues i've just been diagnosed with schizophrenia. here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy.
i hope this is not patronising because each person's set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. i think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. hopefully you'll find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. here's what helped me:stop drinking completely. you may think you're only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. alcohol is of course, a depressant. giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in western cultures but there are now some good non-alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. try going at least a month without drinking. i expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. i don't know much about those though.exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. the endorphins make you feel better, you'll get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run/swim/cycle etc faster and further. if you join a club you'll make some good friends too. personally i think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you're there with a friend. group classes are good though. track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. go out even if it's raining. once you've warmed up it's great.give yourself a project or ambition to work on. immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it's just here on reddit. you might feel right now that you've lost interest in just about everything but there's probably something from your past that you could pick up again. or it could be something totally new. some examples: learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, cad. i hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which i don't think helps much. i think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. just pick something to work on and do it regularly. share what you do with other people.minimise your social media use. there have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. i'm not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but don't just endlessly scroll. same goes for reddit. try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary.find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. good friends are better imo. maybe some of them are having problems too. you could help them and feel good about it.get some quality sleep. go to bed on time and don't allow distractions like your phone. if you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. there's a ton of stuff like that on spotify. you'll want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. there's also sleep radio. also important is getting out of bed on time. have a little routine. get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing feeling good and don't give a shit who hears.recognise when you're ruminating and make yourself stop. this is hard. sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. don't feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. get up and do something. do that thing you've been putting off doing. clean the kitchen. if you're doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow.avoid shift work. it's really not good for you.get a pet. or even just a plant. look after it well.listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. if you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz.spend more time around nature.help other people with their problems. it's rewarding.this last one is going to be very controversial: make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. hopefully you'll find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. i'm not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking 'how are you?' can help lift someone else's mood and in turn could lift yours.
i was inspired by some people here. i got a tattoo.

i need help
i don’t know what to do anymore, i just want to die. i’m in the darkest parts of depression and i have no support system. my boyfriend doesn’t understand, he just asks “why can’t you just choose to be happy?” and i have no answer for him. i wish i could “just be happy”  i need him to love me and give me the support, just to feel wanted and loved... but instead i get called names like a goblin!  he’s just so cold. my eyes are puffy from constantly crying..my mother says i should move in with her, but that relationship can be even more toxic. i also suffer from anxiety and bpd. so not only am i terrified to leave the house, i have an extremely fear of fomo. which leaves me feeling, i don’t even know.... and i’m stuck in a city i hate. i wanna move back home so badly to seattle... but i’m stuck in ohio for another year. and i truly don’t think i’ll survive it. please help me.
i need someone to talk to.
i’ve been hit with a depression episode lately this week and i need someone to talk about it too. just a person that’s willing to be kind and listen and give me advice.
every time it gets better, it gets worse
every time i manage to dig myself out of the hole bit by fragile bit, something inevitably pushes me back below. something small, something big, something as simple as the passage of time. a single bad day, a single bad conversation. when things finally, *finally* start looking up something awful always happens to bring me back down. what do you do when this happens? how do you stop the downward spiral you know is coming? i don't know what to do anymore. i'm so tired.
does anyone have advice for how to deal with feeling hollow and disconnected from people?
so last night me and one of my buddies, who i am very close to, had a discussion on what’s been going on in my head. lately i have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because i have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that i had an abusive childhood. my abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and i can still feel it to this day. anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how i try to reach out to others (particularly women) for comfort, because i feel that i was denied affection by my mother while growing up.all through the conversation, it didn’t feel like i was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. it felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. after leaving i felt hollow on the inside. it lasted till about noon this morning. felt completely worthless and useless.i was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.
i’ve decided that on may 3rd i will decide if i should or shouldn’t kill myself.
i think a month is long enough. also, the meds will have the therapeutic effect around that time. so, i hope that everything is actually better by then. if not, i won’t go on anymore. seems fair.
i made a video talking about my depression, hopefully it helps some people with understand themselves a bit more.
[my depression story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d-wv6hw_kg&t=1s)&#x200b;i would really appreciate it if people could share it, i would love to be able to help people and i think this is the best way to do it. 
i enjoyed my night and lived in the moment i hope you guys did the same

people have been asking for me to put some of my stuff on canvas. so, here ya go. this always seems to cheer me up.

got this tattoo a while ago to stop me from self harming

i made a suicide plan and it scares me
i'm not intending to commit suicide. but i came up with a plan, for the event that i changed my mind, i guess. i've struggled with depression/anxiety for a long time, but i've never had as concrete an idea of how i would do it until now. and that really scares me.  i have a neurological disorder that causes chronic pain and muscle spasms, and i feel like it's deteriorating my normal level of function. i have considered myself high-functioning for a long time. i've been in and out of therapy (currently out) for years, but it's never been helpful. therapists have told me i seem very self-aware, but that i'm closed off. it's a struggle to talk to anyone about anything personal, especially if it's negative. so this is really hard for me, to post like this. i'm hoping the anonymity of the internet makes it easier.   i don't feel like i can talk to anyone in my life about this. i don't want them to know, or blame themselves, or worry. but the dissociation and suicide ideation are getting really bad, and i don't know what to do.
my mom makes me feel worse and i hate how shitty of a person she is
it took me years of being severely depressed until she finally acknowledged it. her initial reactions were you have no reason to be depressed and started making it about herself. of course she immediately defends herself and says she has nothing to do with the way i'm feeling and how great of a mother she has always been and how she doesn't understand why i'd say i'm depressed.meanwhile my home life here with her is 80% of the cause of my depression. she used to be an awful alcoholic and smoker. she would get drunk every other night and sometimes i'd find her on the floor mumbling to herself completely out of her mind. you shouldn't have to go through that shit as a child. she threw me across the room one night just because i stepped in her way. she was never there for me, never understood the shit i was going through at home and at school, always made my issues about herself. only just recently has she been paying the copay for my therapy as i can't afford it right now as freshman in college. it initially helped me cope with my shit, as i used to go once a week but i've been forced to go once every three weeks. now i can't go at all because she's cancelling the card linked to the therapy because she doesn't feel like helping me anymore. i'm on the wrong medication for my depression and i need a psychiatrist, as my depression has only gotten worse in the past month or two of being on it and now i don't know what to do.if i can't afford to go to therapy anymore and never be able to get that psychiatrist, my mental health will only severely decline from here and there's no telling what i might do to alleviate this pain. none of my family members are supportive. my dad doesn't give a shit, and neither does my sister. no one has any idea how serious this shit is except for my boyfriend, who is the only supportive and understanding person in my life. i hate my family so much, they don't give a shit about my mental health and never will. i bet if i killed myself they'd say something like i only wish i could've been there for her more at my funeral and make it all about them.
left work early today with every intention of hanging myself from the tree in my back yard...
and i pussied out...i have no will or reason to live. i hate my job. i feel like i just live to work. getting the company owner to pay his employees what he owes is a constant battle. he tries anything he can to fuck his employees out of their money. even going so far as to threaten to take us to court for trying to challenge him, knowing that we can't afford it. i'm a sprinkler fitter apprentice and the entire company is basically run by apprentices. we have 3 journeymen out of about 20 people. one of those is a service guy, another is the superintendent. only one journeymen actually works on jobs. it's illegal to have jobs run by apprentices, without a journeyman on site. like two months ago the boss went off in a safety meeting about another employee being on a job by himself. now, i'm on a job by myself with even less experience. he constantly bods jobs that we can't man so, we basically have one person per job at this point. i feel completely trapped. this is the only job experience i have. i've always found it extremely hard to get jobs because i have a really hard time with interviews. and it's hard to explain to people that i spent the first years of my adult life homeless and didn't get my first real job until i was 27. i rent a place with my dad. he got a dui a while back and it's taking a lot of his money. i hate the place we live. i'm pretty much just confined to my room whenever i'm home. i can't get my own place because he won't be able to afford the place of i move out. again, i feel completely trapped.so, i went home early today. i have a rope that somebody gave me a while back that i tied into a noose. i stood at my back door for a good half hour, looking at the tree i want to hang myself from. but, i couldn't do it. why? because i'm too fucking scared of a couple minutes of pain leading up to my death. or that somebody is going to see and try to talk me out of it. or that i'll fuck it up and just end up permently disabling myself, but not dieing. or what my dad's reaction would be when he comes home to see me hanging g over his fire pit. even though when i first told him i wanted to kill myself, he said do it. so, i ended up laying down and fell asleep. woke up to pouring ran and yet another reason to despise myself. i have no desire to live yet, i'm too much of a scared little bitch to go through with killing myself.i have no real friends. i rarely get out. i'm a pc gamer. it's pretty much the only thing that distracts me from the fact that i despise being alive. so, everyone i talk to is online. idk why i'm even posting this. i'm just gonna get the same generic bullshit replies that always come up when somebody mentions wanting to die but, here i am. i've never come this close to actually killing myself and all i can think is what a bitch i am for not being able to follow through with it.
need friend to speak
i need friend to talk any true friends there
sometimes i feel the only reason i don't end it all
is because i would break my father's heart. that is the only reason. he has invested so much in me, time money and energy, i would feel like he would feel like he failed, and i feel ungrateful just saying it. i make no difference in nobody else's life, i've always been a super lonely person. that's the only thing that keeps me here :(.
i don’t know how to keep going.
this week i was sent to the hospital for an attempt, lost a relationship, burned a lot of friendships, damaged my car, and scared the hell out of my family-who now knows i’m depressed. my friends don’t see me, they don’t understand, they aren’t there for me at all. those that are there i feel like i’m reaching the point of annoyance with. i can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t focus on anything other than the way i’ve failed everyone around me. i’m trying so very very hard to hold on, but i don’t know how much longer i can keep this up. i can’t see a positive end to any of this. i just want to disappear. i just need someone to care.edit: to everyone who offered kind words, understanding, and advice, i thank you from the bottom of my heart. this is my first ever reddit post and i am blown away by the amount of support i have received. truly a beautiful thing to feel so loved by total strangers.
i feel so alone
i really need to vent. am i the problem if all of my friends ghost me? am i the problem if all the guys who said they’re interested in me drop me and stop talking to me out of nowhere? am i the problem if i met someone online, hung out with them twice and they never respond back to my text a week later? why does everyone keep leaving me? all i do is make people laugh, listen to them, compliment them, give them gifts (like cake, when i bake stuff i give leftovers to my coworkers/friends), and hit them up from time to time to check up on them. why does nobody do the same for me? what am i doing wrong?
i can't open up to anyone
i just don't have anyone to open up to. i've never been close to my sister, and my dad hates me. the only person in my close family i could talk to is my mum, and i don't want to tell her just how bad i feel all the time, because she gets really stressed about everything, and i don't wanna hurt her. i'm not nearly close enough to any of my friends to talk to them about how i feel. i keep posting online, reaching out because i need to feel like somebody cares. and as supportive as everyone has been every single time, i need a shoulder to cry on. i need a hug more than anything in the world, and i can't have it.  edit: wow, i got to the top of the sub! i've gotten a lot of replies, so i'm really sorry if i don't get to everybody! thank you all for being so supportive!
i’m so fucking lonely man i’m getting real bad real quick
i beg all my friends to do something every day but no one has time for me, i don’t even know what to say i have no hope left at all. all i want is to be able to have someone to at least try and be happy with, i’m really close to the edge here idk if i’m gonna start cutting or kill myself or what. i don’t even want anyone here to try and help because i know no one can help me with this i just need to express how i feel.edit: i appreciate the people trying to help me, but i really genuinely did not make this post looking for help, please stop trying to offer me advice. i realise i made it in the wrong sub, it is a post to tell myself how i feel, nothing anyone can say can help me. i am so deeply lonely and heartbroken by losing not only someone else, but also the progress i made with that person that i am really, really beyond help.
there’s probably something wrong with me idk
english isn’t my first language so sorry if i make mistakes..it’s a long story and i’m sure everyone reading this will think i’m weird.so i think i’m probably gay but it’s been really weird and i’m not even sure. years ago i started to feel that i don’t like my appearance and it almost feels like my brain or whatever desperately wants me to be in a different body, that is, the same gender as me of course. i always tell myself that it’s not okay but that’s not how really how your inner self work. the thing is, the change that i (for some reason) want is to get fat. it’s weird because i wasn’t really that skinny anyway. i always imagined as a kid that my soul was too big for my body, and i’m pretty sure as a teenager that’s definitely not the case.i think about this more and more and it’s been bugging me for some time now. i have a friend who’s probably what that inner self (sorry idk what to call that inner voice that keeps bugging me) considers to be my ideal body. (i know it sounds creepy) i started to feel that i always wanted him to live better than me. **there is one thing to make clear: although i think i might be gay, i don’t necessarily “love” him, he’s just a good friend from my high school and we hang out a lot.**he once broke his arm and, when i heard the news, i just snapped. i have broken my arm before and it wasn’t even that painful. but for some reason, that day when he broke his arm i feel so weird deeply that i don’t even know what that feeling is. i started to be very protective of him and it’s started to annoy him a bit. at first these thoughts seemed fine until recently when it started to drive me suicidal.i get worried every time he goes to play basketball, skiing or whatever after that. it’s making anxious, and i can’t even tell him bc he will just think i’m weird and not believe in me. i know you would think none of this make sense, trust me, i think that too. i don’t understand what’s wrong with me and it’s just making me confused and terrified to face the future. it sure doesn’t sound serious but when you have to deal with these weird voices coming from nowhere, it’s a totally different story.i just have to figure out a way to sort out this mess or it will likely keep bugging me until the day i finally decided to hang myself or whatever.sorry for the long post btw

i need someone to talk to right now
i need someone to talk to right now, we can talk about almost anything i don't care, i just need to fill the empty gap in my mind that's filling up with destructive thoughts
i can’t shake feeling depressed when i have no reason to be
it was a rough morning. my husband (m30) and i (f26) had a meeting this morning to get my 3 year old enrolled in an all day pre-k program for the fall, which is pretty hard to get into in my area, and it just seemed like everything that could have went wrong did. i brought our two kids to the car and my hubby forgot to grab the birth certificate we needed that i’d laid out for him to grab. we thought where we needed to go was much closer than it was so we ended up being late. and it just seemed like a lot of small irritations kept coming up as we tried to get there.but then we did get there. and honestly? everything went really well.  like, we were in and out within 15 minutes and are all set to have him attend in the fall. yet.. i’m just frustrated. my husband is wonderful, and spent the little bit of time he had before leaving for work trying really hard to help but i just can’t shake this mood even though this all happened like two hours ago. i just feel.. depressed. it’s like my mind starts feeling upset and even when the issue is resolved i can’t shake the feeling and i just don’t feel like doing anything at this point at all. i’m a stay at home mom, so i’m home with my two young kiddos, but just don’t know how to flip how i’m feeling. i guess i’m just looking for some motivation.. this isn’t the first time this has happened and generally my day ends up being pretty terrible when this does happen and i really don’t want that. i just feel stuck. any advice? 
need advice for holding a job while depressed.
i'm looking for some advice from folks suffering through depression who are able to hold down a job. i seem to no longer be able to do so any more. the only work i can get in my area is call center work, which is such a terrible soul crushing job to do that once i add my depression on top of it, it never lasts long. i have been doing it on and off for the last 12 years and was able to hold on for around a year or two to six months at a time, but the last time i tried i made it one day before quitting. i just can't muster the fake sympathy and pretending to care about the callers issues anymore. but i need to work to live. i have tried shorter shifts, and even part time, but i always end up sitting outside before my shift starts unable to walk through the doors knowing what the next 8 hours are going to require of me. 
first time trying the natl suicide hotline chat. 86th in line

i’m in therapy
lots of highs and lows. lots of pretending to be okay and feeling numb. lots of drinking and/or smoking to escape. lots of things negatively effecting things and people in my life. i’m so tired i wanted a change. yesterday was my first therapy session. homegirl jumped right into it discussing what may trigger my depressive state etc. i think i may like her... hopefully i stick it out.
has anyone had an experience being a bit sad that they no longer have feelings or care about their ex? lost the passion and become cold for what they once though the love of their lives?

i have no one.
i’ve been wanting to talk about this with someone for a while, but i have quite literally no one to talk to. i’m don’t make enough money to go to therapy sessions so this is the next best thing i guess. to start out, i have been rather tall and thin my entire life, it was never a problem, until high school started. as a girl it’s even harder to have the type of body i have. i’m 5’8 and 112 lbs.. anyways, the summer before my sophomore year of high school my dad moved my family to an extremely rural area on the other side of the county, so naturally i had to start at a new high school where i knew absolutely no one. the school i started was full of racist rednecks and i had never been exposed to those type of people. this is pretty funny (and i can’t wait until the day where i’m not so depressed about it that i can laugh about it) but on my very first day, this girl in my science class told the whole class that “she heard the new girl bleaches her asshole” lmao i know completely random. well i have a dry sense of humor so when people asked me if i did i would sarcastically say yes, and they told other people that they asked me and i said yes. so for the rest of the year i was called “butthole bleacher” and i haven’t shared this info with anyone bc i’m so embarrassed. this group of boys would always tell me how disgusting my body is and how i was shaped like a boy. i went home everyday crying because i had no idea people i didn’t even know could be so cruel. this one boy in particular would tell me to kill myself every.  single. day. he was not joking at all which made it worse. i had no friends (still don’t), was told how ugly i was everyday, and was now just known as a girl who bleaches her butthole (it’s ok to laugh at it, i know it’s funny for people who aren’t me) i remember one day in particular i was walking by a group of redecks and this guy goes “there’s the flatass who fucks everyone” . i was shocked and went into class crying. i was confused, i have still never even kissed anyone so i couldn’t understand where people were getting this information from. you may be thinking i’m over exaggerating but i’m not kidding when i say that everyday i was made fun of by mainly boys for being so skinny. the day i hit rock bottom was in dance class. i had just recently experienced a ton of problems at home and the constant bullying made my depression way worse. i had made no friends in the dance class and the time came for a group dance. i waited until the last group went in fear of being made fun of, and in front of the whole entire gym, the whole group as i began to approach them said “no, no, no we don’t want you” and the entire gym laughed. after dance class was last period where the mean boy was. he noticed i was sad and told me i should probably just kill myself. everyone was taking about me on the bus ride home that day, and i just couldn’t take it anymore. i took a rope, ladder, and my phone and climbed as high as i could up a tree in my yard. i was crying and playing my favorite song “american pie”. then i saw my dad pull into the drive way, and i couldn’t do it. then, things began to turn around. i was excepted into the dual enrollment program at the community college, so for my entire junior and senior  year, i’ve been going to the community college full time and have not stepped foot into that school. i love physics so i decided to major in engineering, but, i got a d in calculus ii last semester so i was kicked out of the program and since  i had all my credits for high school, i just began working full time at my job. i still have never had a boyfriend or even my first kiss. i’m so lonely and feel so ugly. although now i’ve accepted the fact that i’m just not attracted to the opposite sex apparently. anyways, i found out i actually had enough credit hours to get my aa before even graduating high school, so i got that last week. i’m just so depressed and i literally have no friends. like i’m not exaggerating at all. none. i feel so lonely and embarrassed. next week is high school graduation and today i had to go pick of my cap + gown from high school during the senior luncheon. as soon as i walked in all of the horrible memories came back and i got the worst anxiety attack i’ve ever had. i pulled myself together and got in the line to get the cap and gown. and then heard a group of boys saying my name and staring at me so i looked over and  a bunch of girls laughed. then, the group forced a gap in line right where i was standing and said loudly “excuse me”, while the rest of the group laughed. i felt so humiliated. i have to actually walk with these assholes next saturday and i’ve never wanted to not do anything more. i just want some friends that i can lean back on when shit like this happens but as aforementioned i have absolutely none. the only thing that keeps me going anymore is my hope that my future will be better. i got into university of florida so i’ll be starting in the fall. i’m pretty excited for a fresh start even though it’s just an hour a way from where i live. but to be honest, i’m so sad right now and i’m back in a rut. i can’t eat, my mom has  to force me to shower or even brush my teeth. i don’t know what to do anymore. thanks if you got this far. advise to keep going?
i just wanna talk
i'm 20 years old from sao paulo, brazil. i've no friends around here cause i move to here about 2 years ago and after all this time i still making no friends. i've a lot to say, just wanna start a conversation with another people of my age or older. idk, i think i'm too old for my age you know? i've many doubts about what i'm doing with my life. maybe i'm little depressed so i think talk will help. anyone?thanks a lot.nicholas coli
i just want to stop existing
i’m terrified of death and not knowing what comes after it, but i don’t see life as something precious or valuable. all i see is suffering and endless hopelessness. i am losing interest in everything and i can feel myself slipping away. it’s been like this for so long i don’t know what happiness feels like and i spend my days drifting in a mixture of self loathing and numbness. i’m so tired and find sleep to be my only escape. school on top of my struggling really exhausts me mentally and physically. i’m scared to die, but falling asleep for a really long time just sounds so nice. even then though, i’d have to wake up and face the cruel reality that there really isn’t anything to be happy about. and it hurts because i can’t escape it. no matter how many nights i spend trying to cry the pain away it’s still there. i have no motivation to really change my life either though, i physically can’t force myself no matter how much i want to, to do anything productive. i don’t know how much longer i can do this, does anybody know what to do? i’m overflowed with these feelings and i can’t help but feel the only way to get some release besides sleep is to harm myself, even if i know it’s not going to help in the end. i’m just done and i can’t keep up with school or my relationships anymore. i need some advice on what to do :(
sleeping in?
hey guys one of my biggest struggles with my depression is my lack of motivation to get out of bed. does anyone have any tips besides the usual (use favorite song for alarm, put alarm across the room, etc) to help me get out of bed?
should i use the psychological help service that my university provides for free?
lately i've been feeling really low. i can't make myself leave the bed, i start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. i think i've always suffered from some kind of depression but i've never been to therapy because i couldn't afford it on my own and my family didn't ever suspect anything. now i live on my own in another city. yesterday i discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. do you think i should give it a go? i'm a bit afraid because i don't know what to expect and i don't really know what to tell them when i'll be there. i know they don't provide help for very serious issues (you'll need a psychiatrist for that) and i hope they don't take care for only university related problems.on the other hand, i have nothing to lose because it's free.did you ever try anything like that? 
this motto got me up and going on days i was depressed

wear your scars strong. they're reminders that now are better days

the brain doesn't care about being perfect - the psychology of perfectionism makes you feel meaningless, leading to self-doubt, perceived failure, and lack of confidence. the solution, research says, is to apply top-down frame shifts.

feeling like an absolute pile of rubbish. psychiatrist has put me on another pill.
from uk. long story short been diagnosed with depression since 14. cureently 29. gps tried me on 8 different types of ssris in various dosages with and without benzos for anxiety. been to many therapies and counselling sessions.in 2014 i got really bad after the death of my nan who raised me. i was referred to a psychiatrist who i believe saved my life.he rediagnosed me with unipolar treatment resistant depression with anxiety. he put me on a tca called lofepramine at 240 mg a day. this is not what the pill is licensed for however he has found through his research thats when the medication works best. (had a lot of gps having problems with prescribing me dosage because of it, even with a letter from him) it also has a short half life and as i was a suicide risk, it was the safest option.been on it for a while. this week he has prescribed me another tca amitriptyline. i also am in weekly therapy (currently mindfulness)anyway, i just hate the fact i have to take pills. everyone has their demons and one of mine is feeling weak for taking medication. and now i have to take another type. it makes me feel so shit, so incapable of functioning like a 'normal' human being. my self hatred is so high and i can't switch off the thoughts.guess i just wanted to see if anyone else is currently taking two types of antidepressants too and how they have been getting on?thanks and apologies for the extremely melodramatic postedit: thank you to everyone that replied to my post, i really appreciate you all taking a little bit out of your time to help a stranger on the internet. i'm not too good at really talking about things so i apologise for not replying to everyone individually.thank you all for your kind and motivational words.
man i hate this feeling
i don’t actively feel sad. i can sort of manage sad.what’s bothering me is there’s things i *want* to do, but i’m just so unmotivated to do anything.it sucks.i want to draw, i tried but it isn’t working. i want to work on my programming project that i’m really excited about, but i can’t manage working on it for more than 10 minutes.same thing with this edit i’m making.normally video games are my go-to when anything like this happens, but i can’t get into any of them.i hate this.
my boring life
i thought i had everything.i was the best.who wouldn't like a smart person kind enough to listen to everything you have to say. always open to new information. always wanting adventure and to learn something new. patient enough to underatand your point of view. that was years ago.this is today. i haven't slept in two days. i haven't had a good night of sleep in four years. my eyes are flooded with tears. i can't get out of bed to do anything. people scare me. i can't tell good from bad. i might delete this but i need to clear my head. you might ask yourself if i mistaken reddit for notepad. probabily. i don't know what i'm doing here.i'm just a shell of what i was. what was once curiosity is now just static, ignoring everything that's outside of my body. i try to follow your words. i try to understand. i am tired. no one sees it. nobody cares. i can't pull myself out. the advice i used to give turned to passive agresiveness and criticism. it's not my fault please understand. my love was meant to get the best flowers out of two seeds growing together. i became selfish. i still want the best for you but there's nothing good left in me. i want you to enjoy life. can you even do it with me? does wanting you closer make me selfish? i treated you so badly lately and i'm so painfuly sorry. i can't stop it. i'm scared to take meds. what if they kill me. i'm really paranoid. i need help. who would help someone as evil as me. someone please force me into treatment if you love me so much. how do i know if the treatment will work. i'm going crazy. this is not who i am... or is it who i am now? i'm scared.edit:a bad word i wanted to remove :'d
i feel like i'm being replaced again and it hurts so much.
we used to hang out and talk all the time, now it takes weeks for my friend to message me back, and it's almost always a one or two word response. my friend doesn't hang out with me anymore, they hang out with someone else now. i feel like i'm slowly being forgotten. this has happened to me before, so i was sort of expecting it to happen again, but it still hurts so much. i don't want to go through this again.
pulling myself out of the pit...at least for a bit
i felt lighter today mentally. i love these days. after a long depressive cycle i am finally pulling myself out of the deep dark pit of depression. the last few weeks have been torture in my own head. i am not suicidal, but i was spending a lot of time wishing i would die naturally. some quick accident that would end the pain. and then days like today remind me to appreciate the little things. nothing astounding happened today, and i don’t know what switch flipped and made me feel a little less sad. but i’m so glad it did. i’ve gone through these cycles as long as i can remember. a deep dark depression followed by a remission of sorts. my depression and anxiety stays with me but i feel stronger and can keep it at bay.      ......until i can’t..... and then i’m back in the fucked up mindset thinking that i am a piece of shit and want to die.but today i enjoyed my life. and i hope some of you did too. if you didn’t...just know a good day is coming. they always do. 
my problems are ruining my relationships. (i’ve also realized that i really don’t like myself.)
like a month ago i’ve met a girl and we’ve been texting every day since then.she has a very good influence on me. my problems (stress, sadness, anxiety etc.) are getting easier to deal with thanks to her.but feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this “goodness”... a lot...i worry about losing her so much that it’s probably not having a very good impact on our relationship...even though i feel better that doesn’t mean i’m totally fine.i still get these waves of [insert any of my problems here].we very often argue when this happens.i’m extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her.she will not like me anymore if i keep having these waves...yesterday we were talking and she brought up how i have very low self-esteem. she wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her self-esteem issues.go to a mirror and say “i love myself.”i was almost unable to do this... i mean- i said it but i didn’t belive it and it made me feel way worse because i didn’t think it was this bad...then i realized how much i don’t like myself...i’ve felt like shit because of that since yesterday. (it’s getting better today, thankfully.)she probably isn’t too happy about having to deal with me in these situations...i’m not sure what to do... i really don’t want to lose her because of this...i hope someone has some good advice for this...
not knowing what i want my future to be is stressful and depressing
i was asked a question the other day and i didn't have an answer and it hit me like a sack of rocks. i've always felt depressed since my dad passed away in 2006 but it's hit me hard lately and i don't know why. i'm recently married, my wife just had my son, have a great paying job that's just like every other job, and a loving family, and i still feel unaccomplished, lonely, and not awake in the world. my future is a dim lit room full of doors i can't see and quite frankly, im afraid to open them. i need help...edit: the question was what is your 3-5 year plan.
i don’t know. i just feel like saying it here that i’m deeply and secretly sad and lonely.
i just wanna fly away but i can’t seem to collect my thoughts. what things make you happy?
after searching all this shit up, 8 am definitely at least moderately depressed. now what?

disassociating badly tonight.

i don't know if i am depressed or just have a severe burnout
for about 7 years now i feel terrible, but it comes and goes. i have periods where i just want to stop existing and after some time i have the feeling that everything is fine. i spoke to my doctor about it (a few days ago for the first time) and she believes that its just a burnout. i have panick attacks when school, work or life in general gets overwhelming, so i get where she is coming from.but does that mean that this feeling that i just want to stop existing and that life is pointless comes from a burnout? she asked if i ever wanted to hurt myself and i said no because i've seen firsthand what it can do to people (family/friends). she said that it probably isn't a depression because of that. is the feeling of a burnout similar to a depression? how do you know the difference?
can i just chat with someone?
first off, i’m not suicidal or anything like that, i just get bouts of random-ass depression and this is one of those times. none of my friends are people i can just approach with this stuff, but it’s tearing me up to not be able to talk to someone.
i feel like ending it but then i just feel to lazy too like i wish someone else would do it for me
so this is another of my accounts as i'd like nobody i know to know but i just don't want to be here at all (female/teen) it just doesn't feel right being here i have no purpose and serve no use to anyone but when i want to end it i'm also really tired and just too lazy to actually do it, i wish i could be uthanized thank you for reading about my pathetic ass 
this is me finally talking about “it”.
i do not have depression, my husband does. he has depression, but we don’t use that word. we say “dark days” and on those days his mood is self-described as “blah”. he has depression, but we don’t talk about it.       it’s not for lack of trying on my part. i wish he could open up and tell me how he’s feeling. i wish he could cry with me and tell me that we’ll get through this as much as i tell him. my husband has depression, but we don’t tell anyone about it. “where’s your husband?” is the hardest question to hear sometimes. “why didn’t your husband come?” “he isn’t feeling well”, i say. “we decided he needed to get some rest.” we don’t talk about it. it is dark. it is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. sometimes, it  isn’t so bad. we have good days. we even have great months. beautiful months. but it rears it’s ugly head and we know. we know because the house feels tight. the rooms when we’re together feel as though they are squeezing in. it doesn’t care that i need to be touched, or that i need to touch my husband. we don’t talk about it. but we do fight through. we stand back to back. sometimes, i have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and that’s okay. i know he realizes all of this, i know because in those good days and great months, i’m treated as a queen. we make love and make memories and we shine. we shine so bright that i know when the dark days come, we’ll fight them. he knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he can’t see or hear me, he knows i’m there. and i know that he’s there, too, still the man i love, the hero of my fairytale. the hardest part though, the part that i wish we could change (because depression isn’t something that can just be fixed, i know this); my husband has depression, but we don’t talk about it.  
rode a huge wave of happiness for a couple months. god damn the crash is hard
made some good memories i guess. but fuck this dude, what's the point of even trying to get happy of i'm just going to fee 10x worse than before 
keeping your living space clean
does anyone else struggle greatly with keeping your apartment/house clean, especially in a low mental place? when i’m more depressed my dishes build up, i run out of laundry and everything goes to shit. i feel better and i’ll clean one room, but then it takes over again  and i can never seem to keep up. if i leave my clothes laying around my cats pee on them and now i’m left with like four bags of clothing covered in cat pee and i don’t know where to begin and what to do with it. i’m so overwhelmed, any time i do clean i avoid dealing with the cat pee clothes. it’s so disgusting and i just keep ignoring it :/
too much for too many people
hi,   does anyone else find that when they try to reach out, to anyone, from therapist to people you want a relationship with, to even just random internet strangers,  you always end up being too much,   to broken, to depressed, to nerdy etc for them to want to keep talking to you,   so you spend years of your life pretending like you live a shallow existence so you dont seem to be too much for too many people and it just leads you to be cold and alone with no one knowing who you really are and craving real human contact for someone whom im not some case study for or a good deed of the day to listen to.       is it just me who craves actual human contact or have i finally gone mad
it's 4:37pm and i've been laying in bed all day crying
i can't seem to get up to do anything. i got up oncw to take a bath (which is my go to thing i do when i'm depressed) and once to eat food, which i had to talk myself into doing for 30 minutes. i just need help. tips, tricks, anything really. i'm desperate. edit: thank you to everyone who helped me! it made me feel that i was less alone. i love this community!
the three little guys that help me keep going in life :) just putting this here for someone who needs an aww

it’s like i’m not allowed to feel this way
recently, my depression symptoms have been worse. my mom brought me to the doctor and because i’m too afraid to open up, my trash doctor thinks i’m faking so he told me to smile more and think positive. now my father thinks like my doctor and every time i’m feeling down, he becomes angry at me for feeling that way when i can’t help it. it’s like i’m not allowed to be depressed. nobody understands my pain. but i understand because i never fully opened up. any advice for handling my situation?
please dont get mad. i need help/advice
hello. i hope this doesn't rub off people the wrong way or come off as a trigger to people. anyone here who lost their mom/dad to suicide? and how hasnit affected you while growing up? i'm asking because lately i've been having an intense desire to hang myself outside. i have a two year old beautiful loving son but even seeing his face doesn't make these thoughts go away. i even think it's for the best if i'm gone, he'll be better off with his dad. i just have this feeling that they'd all be relieved if i'm dead
i pushed my friends away
they noticed i had been down lately, it's not rare but it's taking me alot longer to recover than before. they tried to ask me and see if i was okay and i kept saying that i'm fine and they should not waste their time on me. i now realize how much of an ass i am, how do i apologize?
i really dislike positivism as a way to try to help me with my depression.
i meant to say positive thinking because positivism is a philosophical concept. my bad.i may be a cynic and that's why but i do feel like, instead of helping, positive thinking makes me feel like an incompetent person, like i'm being talked down by the superior other that is going to come down to tell me the universal answers. it sounds like the one doing the positive talk is patronizing me. is not that i'm the one who has low self esteem, it definitely sounds like you are the one with superior complex and or humble brag. *it's so easy to to be happy, just do what i do, it worked wonders for me, how can you not be happy with what you have? i care about you, you are so strong (smiley face thumbs up  heart kitty)*. ugh... it's like baby talk. it's condescending.i would prefer to talk without pink filters. trying to think that *everything will be ok*, *don't worry, you have people that loves you*. no, it won't be ok, it will suck ass and i will have to confront it one way or another anyways and trying to color it doesn't help me prepare for it. i prefer to grab that sadness and anger and use it in a productive way instead of trying to cover my eyes and go to my happy place ignoring and avoiding everything that i cannot change thinking that tomorrow will be a happier day, watching the beauty of the world around me. that only works so much and doesn't solve anything. sometimes saying you know what, yeah, it fucking sucks and there might not be a solution to it it's much better because i can stop focusing on it and start trying other things. sometimes a smack on the face on someone that is being a dick to you is what is needed to stop certain situations. let me lash out at the world and let others know that something might be wrong with it and it won't get better unless it changes too.i would prefer not avoid not to hurt the other with my words or my supposed toxic behavior because i can't see the bright side, censoring myself and what i actually think every five minutes to try to keep things going and make the other not feel offended.all i'm saying is i hate positive thinking. it's useless for me.
what do i do when i feel like i'm not getting any better?
lately i've been having a depressive episode. i've been getting help for the past 4 years or so, i thought i had found a medication set to help control things a little better, my therapist seems helpful, but i honestly feel like everything is only a temporary fix and that i'm not actually getting better despite taking every step i can think of to work towards feeling better.
depression anger
my depression and anxiety causes me to get angry often. i am not a violent person but these situations leave me with the feeling of wanting to hit or break something (only things, never people). only there is nothing around that i could damage without causing further problems. does this happen to anyone else? how do i handle this? it is happening more and more often?
complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation?
 hey, before depression took over my life i\[23f\] used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. before finishing college i used to think that lack of time is my only problem, i had so many plans and wishes and i used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. and then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.at first i thought it's only a bad phase and i was expecting it to end soon since i was about to start my summer vacations. i had planned a 2 weeks trip to scotland and i was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow i couldn't enjoy it, i only wanted to sleep and be alone and i was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. that's when i realized that bad phase was a special one, but i only decided to get specialized help when i was already 4 months deep into it. at that point i was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. at that moment, one of my best friends told me i was only a shadow of the person i used to be. the best feeling i was able to get about anything was this is almost acceptable.after my first visit to the psychiatrist i was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - christmas was coming and i started wanting to do stuff awake!! i started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. i was still sad mostly, but i was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. i also got fired right before christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but i wasn't even mad about it. i mean, i cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because i knew that's what i'm supposed to do when i get fired but i didn't really feel much about that event. in january i went in a trip to new york with one of my best friends and i enjoyed every moment of it! then i came home and started looking for a new job. i was so relaxed and carefree and i was becoming my old self again. in february i started a new job and shortly after that i stopped my antidepressants treatment.but i feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. sometimes i get close to what i used to be before this whole thing but i can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) i am mostly anxious and scared. i can't be genuinely happy with the good things i have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. i heard things like you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression, depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life, depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back. i am starting to believe these things and it's sad. are they true? i have no chance to going back to my old self?
the day i got a zero.
i am having my semester exchange now in korea and received my quiz results that i took 3 weeks ago. i got a flat zero. not even a chance was given to me.i knew i was fucked when i was doing the paper because none of the things i studied came out. i studied wronly by just trying to remember the theory but i didn't find the practise questions to practise.turned out i couldn't do a single question out of the 3 questions. i tried to write whatever i know hoping to get some makes but not a single chance was given. flat zero.i am a hard worker because i am not smart. things like this really makes me feel like giving up at times. i know i should have studied smarter. it was really a messed up part on my revision.i am having my midterms next week and i know its a chance for me to make it right again. but i am so tired. i have a total of 7 exams to take within 3 days.at this point of time i'm just sad and tired. but i still have to study. that's my life right.
fighting the beast
i've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years.  ever since i was raped when i was 8.  i've been told that i'm bipolar.  the only thing that saved me from committing suicide was music.  i made this video last year that really spoke about some of the demons i was fighting using a gorilla as my body and face to represent the beast.  i've been ashamed to share these things in the past but i think i have a responsibility as a musician to be honest about everything i go through.  here is the youtube link if you want to check it out [https://youtu.be/dens8prr4vk](https://youtu.be/dens8prr4vk)
i just...
i can’t do this anymore. i can’t stand this feeling. i can’t stand second guessing every valid relationship i have and everyone who cares about me. i can’t stand feeling like i’m just a burden to people who have their own problems. i just... can’t do this anymore. 
i have been severely depressed and it is affecting my school work and looking for advice
since i've hit my 20's, my depression has just plummeted. in high school, i hadn't been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didn't feel nearly as bad as this. i hit my 20's, now 23 yrs old, and i am having constant depression cycles. the cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. as of lately i have been probably the most down that i have felt to date. i am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. i haven't been keeping up with classes, i have been failing exams and i don't have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. i have fucked myself so badly with school i don't know what to do. i want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. i really want to get better. however, if i take a leave from school i will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. my fiancé and i are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. it is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. i am asking advice on what to do. i need to take a break from school or i will just keep digging myself deeper into this gpa and depression nightmare, but we also can't lose any money from it. i do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but i just need a break now. i am lost. any advice would be so helpful.
burnout is on the rise in society. and science says the solution isn't simply to work fewer hours. it's much more complicated (and introspective).

how can i forgive myself?
i hate myself and i can’t forgive myself for what i’ve done! i was so depressed and i broke up with my bf after 4 years we were literally 24/7 together.. i can’t forgive myself for the damage that i caused to him, i broke his heart, he’s insecure about everything because of me, i want him back to fix what i’ve broke but he refused, he’s afraid of everything.. i made terrible mistakes, i wasn’t mature enough and i was acting really stupid, i used to control everything, and say if you did that i’ll leave, like if you smoke or drink or whatever, i used to hate smoking because i hate my father and he’s a smoker, i wasn’t admitting that and i used to say that i just hate smoking without saying any reasons, and all sudden i start to smoke to threat him that i’ll never stop till he stops i know i was doing the wrong thing but i was depressed and i didn’t understand what i was doing, i attempt suicide and i told him its because of you and you’re not a good person although i loved him so much, and still. idk i was just worry i didn’t want him to hurt him self or smoke or whatever, i used to send him big long text saying how much he made me hate my life and i’m smoking because of him and doing everything bad and depressed because of him, i used to hurt him, all that was in the last 6 month, we had a 3 years full of happiness and good memories, everything happened was in the last 6 month, we broke up 4 month ago.. i tried to talk to him but said its over and i still can’t believe that we broke up i can’t stop thinking about him, our memories everywhere, what  can i do to make him forgive and come back? i only thing i know that he still in love with me and he didn’t get over it but he’s afraid .. i feel like i’m such a monster and i really want to fix everything, i’m his first love and he’s my first love too so its really hard to get over it, i feel like 4 years is worth one more chance? after we broke up i travelled to another country and stayed alone for 3 months, in this period i’ve changed into a good person, and i finally felt that i’m mature enough to take care of him and be in a healthy relationship. i loved him so much that i was acting as i’m his mom not his gf, saying no to everything he want and saying that i care about you and don’t do thaaaaaat and i used to force me to do what i want and if say no i used to threat him that i’ll hurt myself if he did it.. but i have changed now i understand everything and i won’t ever do what i was doing .. i wish he could give me another chance to be the right gf that we make things together and have fun together not his mom who say no to everything .. i quit smoking for 50 days and i got a vape to quit, now i’m smoking again but because i wanted to! i mean the first time i smoked just to make him feel bad about it now i took the decision cause i want to, i feel like i’m mature enough to do whatever i want to, i got over hating smoking, i drink once a week just to have fun and laugh a lot and forget about whats happening in my life, i happy with my new life but still want him to be a part of it and i know he thought that i’m drinking&smoking because of him again and he will never understand cause we’re not talking to each other anymore ..  idkkkk what should l do? should i try to talk to him again? and see him? i tried once but i was far away and i just texted him saying that i’ve changed but he didn’t believe that i have changed, what should i do?  help me please
reminded that i'm a failure
i've dropped out of college this year due to severe depression as well as family and financial issues currently going on. my friends are graduating this weekend and i would have been graduating with them as well. i'm so proud of them, and i feel so selfish feeling this way, but at the same time seeing how ecstatic and joyful their family is and seeing them get their degrees just reminds me i was never good enough to make it to the end like them. even if i did graduate, no one from my family would probably have gone. my own parents have never told me they were ever proud of me growing up, not once. if anything they only reminded me of my failures.the majority of my depression is caused from growing up in extreme poverty and an unstable household with brothers abusing drugs, abusive parents, neglect, and childhood trauma. i went to a private university and none of my friends or anyone i knew even remotely experienced anything like that. sometimes i get frustrated that a big reason why i couldn't graduate was because of the baggage and instability from my childhood that more privileged people graduating at my school didn't have to deal with. but i guess that's just life, it's not fair.anyways, thank you for reading a little bit of my story.
how to help my girlfriend with severe depression?
my (19m) girlfriend (19f) of one and a half years has struggled with varying severities of depression throughout her life but recently it has become very difficult for her. unfortunately, due to a heart condition she is unable to take certain medication including antidepressants. additionally, her parents are fairly dismissive of mental illness, and even if she were able to take medication her parents would disapprove. obviously this makes treating her depression very hard and i can’t stand watching her struggle. over the last month she said she just feels so alone and frequently thinks about suicide or self harm. if anyone in similar situations or otherwise has any suggestions for ways i could help her get through this trying time i would be very grateful. activites, date ideas, or just ways i should compose myself would be greatly appreciated.
ugly people, how do y'all deal with it?
so i'm pretty ugly tbh, i would rate myself as a 3-4, body wise i have a nice body, starting to lose it though because i haven't worked out in a couple months, but even though i have a nice body, my face is full of acne scars and i'm going bald and i'm not even 25 yet.sometimes i don't even want to go outside because i feel like i'm too ugly, but that's honestly only when i'm feeling down.the biggest problem for me is finding affection, i understand that i'm not attractive, so i don't expect the girl to be that pretty, but honestly i don't get any form of affection, and the little attention i get is from girls who are not even slightly attractive (i know talking like this, makes it seem like i'm a horrible person, but honestly idk how else to say it). honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though i have friends, they are not really people who i can depend on. sometimes i just want to start getting escorts or something to spend my time with, but i know i'll feel even more depressed if i go down that route.
i’m struggling to find a reason.
i don’t see any point in staying. what stopped you?edit: hey guys i’m so thankful for your replies. i contacted my psychologist who directed me to  a free group therapy program and my boss has agreed to allow me to take time off work every week to participate. i really feel like this will help and perhaps bring purpose into my life. i am still feeling very low and have intent however your ideas and perspective has been taken on board. ❤️
advice to stop doing nothing?
i’ve been really struggling these past few weeks to do anything at all, i get out of bed, sit around all day, sometimes eat some sugary snacks, and go back to sleep as soon as i can.. it’s just making me angry at myself at this point but i don’t know how to break the cycle/get motivation to do anything at all(i’m 20 and a full time student (not a very good one at all) if anyone wants context)
my friend is dying inside and i don't know how to help him
my friend has had depression for at least 4 years now. my friends and i have been helping him through his depression for a while. he's been through therapy and had been admitted to  a mental hospital about a year ago for attempted suicide and self harm. but it doesn't feel like anything is changing. he's still numb with not much to look forward to, and i don't know what he wants to do with his life. i need some advice, because i don't know how much longer he can hold on before he inevitably kills himself. 
epiphany...
let’s see if i can explain this. i feel sad, i feel guilty or abnormal for feeling sad and then i spiral. i feel tired, i want to nap, i beat myself up for feeling this way and call myself lazy, etc. and spiral downwards. i’ve decided to eliminate all the judgement on myself for feeling the way i do. so i feel sad, it’s ok to feel sad- i’ll do something that usually distracts me or makes me feel better and eventually that feeling goes away. i want to nap- fine i’ll take a nap- eventually after an hour i feel rested and move on with my day. typically, i go back in forth about whether or not i should take a nap, judging myself for wanting to nap and wishing i had more energy or could power through my day like all my “normal” friends. this turns into laying in bed for an hour spiraling into utter exhaustion so that i have to take a two hour nap just to recover. anyone understand the spiraling and mental exhaustion that comes with judging yourself negatively for every feeling, thought, etc you have? i’m done with it!

just got released from the er. i took myself because i was having suicidal thoughts. i feel it really helped me being in there. seeing people in far more pain and suffering then me really made my heart hurt. my new goal is to someday be able to help people like myself who suffer from depression.

loneliness is taking over me
i never realized how much i rely on having human contact and connection. i recently went through my first heartbreak and i lost a best friend and i’m losing my other friend. i feel like neither of them cared about me as much as i cared about them. i feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. i feel like i give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when it’s not reciprocated in the end. i know that’s selfish of me but i wish i knew what i was doing wrong. i feel so alone and all i wish i could have was a genuine human connection. it doesn’t have to be romantic. just to have someone be there and not leave me. my depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. for the first time i’ve really thought about giving up on life because i feel so useless and not good enough. i have one friend left but i’m afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. i know it isn’t fair. we talked and he made me feel better but when we don’t talk the emotions come back. how can i be happy with being alone. i don’t know what to do. i just want to feel hope and happy with myself. all i do is sleep because the days are too painful to live through.
i know a good way to help with anxiety attacks.
when you feel an attack coming what i like to do is use my senses.eyes: look for 5 different thing you can see.what can you see?ears: listen for 4 different things. what can you hear?touch: look for 3 things you can touch. what can you feel?smell: look for 2 things you can smell. what can you smell?taste: looked for 1 thing you can taste. what can you taste?

the world is a terrible place and life is not worth living
on a larger scale. i don't understand how people look at humanity and see something worthy. the world is a cesspool. humans are filth.  on a smaller scale.    i don't understand how people find interacting with others fulfilling, instead of draining.    i don't understand why people would want another person sleeping next to them, taking their free time, always being around them, bothering them.  i don't understand how people take the small portion of the day that they spend not working, sleeping or commuting, and find the time and willpower to do anything social or productive with it.    i don't understand why people are ambitious, why they strive to gain status or money.    i don't understand why people work out or eat healthy. i've tried it many times, for long periods. i've had good health and a healthy, fit body.    i felt worse, felt drained by spending my limited free time on doing something i don't enjoy, and eating (one of my few pleasures) things that didn't give me a spike of dopamine. i felt no joy at being 'attractive'. i still felt tired, still felt like my body was slowly dying.    the tiny, tiny spike of pleasure at achieving something that i set out to do is nothing. it's shorter and less enjoyable than, say, the pleasure of hearing a really funny joke.    whenever i manage to achieve something that is supposed to help my depression, all i can think about is how empty it was, how i wasted my time forcing myself to suffer through something i hated doing.    i've tried medications. it works for a while and then i get used to it, it stops working.    the more of them i try, the less effective it seems. the first one lasted a while.    it's hard to remember what it's like, but i do remember thinking how beautiful the sunset was, how golden the sun. i remember having more energy.    i don't think i'm every getting that back.
anxiety is ruining my life and relationships and idk how to stop it.
background information, i'm 20 years old in 3rd year university for mechanical engineering. for the last two years i have had severe anxiety that stems from two things; a really bad ex who lied to me and manipulated me to the point where i was cheated on twice. track and field is also my life and when i get injured for long periods of time i go into a deep depression. recently i've been feeling terribly anxious. my resting heart rate is so god damn high because i'm worrying about everything, my relationships, my classes and my job. i can't even focus on class at this point because i'm so distracted and i want to cry so much. nothing my psychologist does helps me, i hate my life because i'm always like this. i never used to be and i want to just go back to normal. i miss not having anxiety and being able to relax. i miss running t&f, i miss having someone to make me a better person. i'm so heartbroken with my life going down the drain and idc anymore. idk what to do.  i can't sleep at night anymore, i'm so exhausted and done. i can't do it anymore. idk why i'm posting this because nothing is going to help.
just need to talk to anyone
so i have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because i felt like my problems are not important. but now i want to post something. i actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. i don’t want to be a burden to anyone. i’m gonna start with what happened today. this story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. i’m typing this out because the four hours i spent with my fiancé has been the longest i have felt happy this week and i just need to talk to anyone right now. me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. he had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). we went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. i was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. after that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. i was telling him a funny story about a quest i did in a game i’m playing. then i got a phone call from my mom. she wanted to know where i was and when i’m going to be back. now i know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. that doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. so someone has to be home with him.  i said ok and we started to head back. this when i noticed that my fiancé was upset. i asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. he was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. he also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. i started feeling like i ruined the whole day. his plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. on the way back i was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. i was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. while we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and i went inside. i say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. he did try calm me down before hand but i was just so angry. my parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was i upset. i told them but my mom made feel worse. she made me feel like i should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. my dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was i supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. i was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. that what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. every-time i tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. that yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. it ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. now he has gone to bed and i’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. i just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. i can’t call him because he has work in the morning and i want him to rest. i feel like i need help, i’m a mess. i feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me. i just want to start the with a smile and end the day with a smile.
41 (m) pushed the self-destruction button last night and have fucked up my relationship.
background: scottish, 3rd of 6 brothers, bi-polar (and sad). tldr - depression kicked in, drank too much told gf to fuck offever since i can remember something was always  ‘off’ with me. 1st hard bout of depression kicked in when i was around 23yo and since then i had been able to manage it (sometimes). i found an outlet in music and ended up touring around europe as a busking musician and as an audio engineer. although i was emotionally drained every night i was relatively happy until the drinking kicked in and then it became too much. i worked hard to get back on track and move away from that life (though i would still perform on my own to try and keep an outlet). i moved to lisbon and spent 1 and 1/2 years working in almost constant sunshine beside the ocean. this was very beneficial to my health and emotions. after 10 years of being single due to being ashamed of myself and my problems, i fell in love. we both moved slowly to be sure of the relationship and eventually i moved to northern italy to be with her and found a great job teaching. however, now i feel very isolated and have found it very difficult in making friends here. in 9 months of being here i haven’t been able to pick up any meaningful italian. my drinking has started to creep back into my life. i’m in the middle of winter and the sad syndrome has kicked in big time. i’m constantly arguing with my gf and not for the first time i have told her it is over and never to speak to me again. i have never been physical in anger but i can shout very loudly and my words can sting badly. when i get like this i always try to walk out of the argument to calm down but last night i couldn’t. in the middle of the motorway i demanded she let me out (which she refused obviously) this got me more angry because i can not get out of the situation. eventually she was able to stop somewhere safe and let me out. i found myself in the middle of winter walking along the motorway in jeans and a t-shirt. and only got home thanks to two police officers. today i contacted alcohol anonymous because today i recognise that i am the problem. i know i will need to find a psychiatrist to dig deeper and work out the causes and hopefully i can regain my life again. i write this only to release this from my heart and mind for now.  but grateful on any advice if you think it could help. 
should i leave this world?
my friends, my family, even my sister can't understand me. they made fun of me but didn't even know how much it hurts me (such as my study results, my hobby, my looks, etc). you can say they don't care about me, it's not wrong. am i worth living in this life or i should end these long depressed days?
my high-5 day:
i finally cleaned my cooktop after months of grossed-out guilt. and i mean i removed all the parts—grates, caps, knobs—to the laundry sink and scrubbed the the living shit out of every nook and cranny. i also did the same level of attention to my toaster oven. this comes after four days of not getting out bed, so i think it’s pretty big.

i just got rejected
i’ve been in love with this dude for months and it finally happened. he said he didn’t have feelings for me and he never would. i feel like an idiot and fool for thinking he could love me. he was my favorite person and now i’m lost. the darkness is consuming me and i want to let it. i hate myself for not being good enough
i don't know how to approach teacher about f in the class
hi everyone. i'm currently in my second semester of college and my depression has really taken a toll on me. i have been really trying to get my shit together and for the most part i have- except for my journalism class. i have never gotten below a c in a class, but right now i have an f because of missing assignments.  i'm registered with my school's disability center but i don't think that will help me with this. the teacher emailed me to tell me that i was failing and that i could go to his office hours if i wanted to discuss my grade. i am terrified that he is going to withdraw me or tell me that it's my fault (which it basically is). has anyone gone through this? were you able to pass?? any advice would be appreciated.
daily breakdowns. tw: suicidal ideation and self harm
i'm a 17 y/o trans man. i have anxiety, depression, adhd, and am a victim of sexual assault. i've been out as trans for 2+ years and in that time my family has done next to nothing to accept me. they stand firm on use of my birth name and female pronouns, regardless of how much it upsets me. i spend atleast an hour a day having a breakdown from this.(sometimes much more) i've considered suicide more than i'd care to admit. i have to force myself not to cut. i'm stuck and feel like it wont get better.
something i wrote and thought some of you could relate maybe
depression is more than a dark cloud following you around. it’s pain, it’s sadness, it’s weight on your shoulders, it’s guilt, it’s frustration, it’s a lack of feeling like you’re enough, it’s an assumption that you’ve made about yourself that you’re not worth a *damn thing*. you look in the mirror and you might as well have the word mistake written on your forehead in permanent marker. you go through moments where you feel everything at once and then other moments where you feel nothing at all. you have reasons screaming at you to leave it all behind but your voice of reason is shouting *“no!”* in the far distance. dreams remind you of the pain that your mind can’t forget, which naturally means you never get to escape. when you’re awake you cry and as the tears hit your cheek, they instantly shatter your sanity. in your dreams you may *scream* yourself awake. the feeling of sadness seems to creep into your fingers and toes, making it impossible to pick up the phone and ask for help, or walk into a place where you may find hope. the voice you have is no longer yours, it almost seems as if you are listening to another person speak, yet its your lips moving. *there would be less hurt if i wasn’t here. there would be less worrying on others if i weren’t here. there would be less…* your mind even is too tired to finish the sentence. *you will be ok.* they tell me but it’s easier said then done because they don’t feel this.. *i have lost everything. i have no idea who i am anymore. why am i here? i take 1 step forward and i fall at least 10 steps back. i need a sign that this isn’t for nothing.. that i’m not nothing.* 
i wake up hating myself
every day is a fight for me [25m] to push suicidal thought and i don’t want to act on any of it .im used to it at this point really.i try and be productive and normal i try and  help others,start projects ,go to work but i’m always in this deep pain where i can’t bare to even think i’m a good or worthy person. of course i masks every thing with jokes and a fake smile but it doesn’t help. i don’t know what can make me happy make me little comfortable . this subreddit help me out a lot and there are time that i really just wanted to die but you guys helped out a lot .i just never know what to do anymore.death is not an answer but i just don’t like being alive and it’s scary.
i can’t enjoy the things i used to like
i don’t know what happened. i’m 17f and i suddenly stopped liking music and watching movies and tv shows recently. i don’t really have any motivation to do anything. before, i would try to finish all my schoolwork so that i could listen to music and watch stuff without any stress. i never felt this way until my senior year in high school. i don’t know if this was built up due to stress, fatigue, and my age or if this change was just sudden. the reason i mentioned my age and gender was because i think these things played a role in how i feel right now. i don’t mean to be tmi but ever since i had my period, i’ve felt some type of depression. i thought it was some hormonal imbalance and that it would go away but i’m not sure. right now, it’s hard to recover. i’m still always tired and unmotivated. i want to rest still but i can’t due to school. i haven’t had the healthiest lifestyle. i think i was sleep deprived, my diet didn’t have a lot of protein, and i rarely exercise.  the only thing i want is to feel the way i used to before. i don’t know if how i feel right now is temporary or permanent. i hope i don’t need medication. thank you to anyone who reads this.
i feel like a terrible person
okay so recently my mom went on facebook and said she was going to kill herself, she then went one and blamed two of my sisters and i. people at my school saw it and now everyone knows i’m the reason my mom wants to die. that’s not why i’m mad however, i’m mad because i have a 10 year old little sister that she was just going to leave, and even though i don’t talk to my mom everyday i’m still hurt that she was just going to leave me. i feel so guilty that i’m mad at her because i also struggle with mental health and i’ve been there before, and i’ve felt what she feels but i’m still so angry at her. she’s never been the best mom, she’s hurt me in the past so many times and this whole thing makes me want to cut her off for good, and even though she’s hurt me so many times i know me wanting to just leave will hurt her, so i’m trapped. please people of reddit, what should i do? and am i a terrible person for being mad at her?
read this about a month ago and i've thought about it every day since. i wish this kind of carefree satisfaction on each of you.

how do you respond when your boss asks you if you're happy?
i'm 58 years old and newly diagnosed with depression for the first time in my life. i was promoted at work and the stress was unbearable and threw me into this. depression. i turned the job down but my life hasn't gotten any less stressful.the location where i work doesn't qualify for fmla although we do have a leave of absence. i'm sure i'm going to be fired soon because after 6 years on this job i'm making mistakes. fear doesn't really help anxiety does it? so my boss asked me are you happy?. i don't even know what i answered; i think my mouth worked like a fish out of water. i don't know if i said i'm trying or i was, or what?the look on her face was like yep that says it all.edit to update: my anxiety meds kicked in enough that i could talk to my boss calmly. i explained that this wasn't just a case of the blues. she asked if a less stressful position would make a difference. i told her i thought it might. but of course i'll have to take a cut in salary. i guess that's better than no job.i wish i'd never taken that promotion. it's cost me my career my sanity and my income.
i have been diagnosed with ptsd and depression .... warning this is very very dark
ik this will be a waste of everyones time but even if no one reads this i need to write it down....i'm 14 now....back years and years ago when i was 4 my eldest sister  raped my 4 year old self  she had mental issues...she started cutting me with knives and making me watch her cut her self.....she continued this till i was 9...that's when she finally moved out of my family's house...she had drilled it into my brain that what she did to me was notmal and if i told my parents or other siblings  she would murder them...so i never told anyone....not until a month ago current time... after my sister left the house she still kept in touch with my parents....my parents constantly made me visit my sister which brought the memories back...my sister hadnt changed she'd threaten me any chance she got...i started feeling so so depressed. and on top of that my father started...acting worse....he used to be so nice but i think the stress of my sister (they knew she had mental issues just not what she'd do) i think the stress kinda broke him... i felt like i'd lost my family around that time i was barely coping but then something worse happend.... my hands started going numb...i started having flashbacks...of a sort....dreams i was sleep walking...slowly but over a course of a few months i'd lost almost all feeling in my hands and started getting dizzy...my hands started hurting and i started getting sick more often...and every time i'd get sick my whole body would go numb...not even figureitivly my body really was going numb... soon things became progressively worse and my parents took. me to doctors  after doctors....they all did tons of tests on me but couldn't pinpoint anything...in the end they ended up just saying  welp we dunno but i guess you'll end up calling it fiber myalgia... a while after that my condition had worsened so much i decided to quit ice skating...one of my favorite sports because it was to painful for me...and since i'm homeschooled that was one of the few places i had friends...i started losing touch with them... i was in and out of hospitals for a number of things...each one being mostly untreatable...my other sister (not the one who raped me) my other sister said i made my problems out to be bigger then they were...i found out that if i didn't speak up about anything they'd worry and see just how much i had trouble...so i stopped talking i continued trying to handle everything myself i kept the thing that happend in my childhood a complete secret....no one knew... it was eating away at me...i had almost no friends i was  depressed  and in pain 24/7... my parents sensed i was depressed and they tried to tell me it was a side effect  of my condition. which made me feel as though they were saying my feelings weren't my feelingss...  it built up...then one day on my birthday my parents invited my eldest sister to the house.... when she arrived she was visibly pregnant...none of us had known... she  had all the attention on her the whole day and i kept worrying how she'd parent the child when she was so cold hearted...  she told me that day that she would no longer harm me...because when the baby arrived it would be her new play thing she said.... i felt sick               to the stomach it was my 14th birthday and that was the day i attempted to end my own life... i had left a letter explaining everything about my sister to my mother and other sister... i had left that letter knowing they'd save that little baby from my sister...then i let go and tried to die...i felt so sad..all my life i looked toward the future with bright eyes...and i had decided in one moment i couldn't continue farther....turns out my parents had invited one of my last  friends over to surprise me...he was the one that walked in and found me nearly dead...when my parents saw me i'll never forget how my mothers face looked or how uncaring my father looked. they rushed me to the hospital  and i obviously lived or i wouldn't be typing this..  i still feel depressed but really dont want to die...but i am having trouble finding a reason to live... my mother is the only one who ever found and read the letter so she and i talked about my sister...my mother loves my sister very much and had a hard time with it...another reason why i didn't tell anyone... she just had no idea that was going on... my sister  dropped contact with my family and fell of the radar...i assume my mother had something to do with that... the baby? well my sister had a miscarriage only a couple days ago...around the time she fell out of touch... i haven't pressed charges on my sister..i just can't get myself to do it... i know this is probably the lamest stuff to be depressed about but i honestly don't want to go to counseling where someone is paid to care... i feel depressed like any other 14 yr old i guess.  and i don't see a future for me anymore... i'm sorry this was long and i'm sorry if i wasted your time. i just needed to type i guess....
i feel like a shadow of my former self, completely and utterly broken
this is a very long story that i need to get off my chest, so expect a long read.my mother divorced my dad when i was very young because my dad was a drug addict with severe mental health problems, who would frequently fly into rages and trash the house. i lived alone with my mom, she is a good hearted woman but has some major anger problems and ocd. as a kid i had plenty of cousins that i was very close with, including one my age who i was extremely close too. however when i was six, my uncle got sent to prison and his psychopath wife who hated my family left with the kids, we haven't seen them since. as a kid, this made me extremely sad. however, when i told my mom that i was feeling sad, she didn't even bother to ask why, she just told me to man up. at this point my mom remarried to my stepdad, who seemed to be an ok guy at first but then showed his true colours as a controlling, narcissistic and cruel man. he frequently tells me that i have a big ego, while he thinks he is the most perfect person on the fucking planet. as a kid i was a trouble maker, so me and my stepdad didn't get along very well. he would often verbally/emotionally abuse me, as a kid i brushed this off. after a while my stepdad began hitting me. it rarely happened, but when it did, it was more of a beat down than a punishment. he hit me with a wooden spoon or his belt, until my ass was bleeding and i couldn't sit down for a week. once he punched me in the head and i had to stay home from school so no one would see the bruise. my mom, who is a lovely woman, didn't care because she thought he was so great. once he forced me to eat my own fucking vomit. i started to develop major anger problems due to this, i no longer felt like i belonged, and often imagined scenarios where i would leave my house and find where i truly belonged.as i got older, i had problems at school. one of my friends got bullied by this group of kids until he had to leave the school. the group then started targeting me. i was getting bullied and beat up after school. one time when i was getting stomped by the group of kids, a group of my friends showed up to help me out. after a massive fight in the parking lot, i went completely rage on the main asshole and managed to gain the upper hand against him. i wanted to beat the fuck out of him, but i decided that i wouldn't sink to their level. after this, the jerks left me alone. i started to make more friends, gained an interest in drama, creative writing and martial arts. my life was great for a couple years, even my stepdad started acting really nice to me, i started having an actual father-son relationship with him. i became emotionally attached to my friends, my anger problems had improved and my sadness that had been there since i lost my cousins had disappeared. i remember one morning i woke up with more energy than normal, a massive smile on my face. i wondered why i was acting like this, then i realised, as i teared up, that i was actually happy. i felt like i belonged for the first time in ages. eventually we moved to another city, i was devestated because my friends were probably the only good thing in my life. this led me to become emotionally unstable, my pre-existing anger problems get worse and i began suffering from severe depression. i would cry myself to sleep each night and get up every morning with no energy, just wanting to lie down and die. i quit my hobbies and became a shadow of my former self. i used to be a very confident person, now my self esteem has taken a nose dive, i feel like i have failed myself and my friends. i hated my self, i tried to commit suicide, not because of sadness, but because i was so enraged with my self that i thought i deserved to die. at my new school i got bullied often, because i had become very introverted. this led me to get into plenty of physical fights at school. i became more angry and got into more verbal fights with my parents. every girl i fell for and asked out has rejected me. i am a loser who fails at every thing i try to do, i cannot honestly say to myself that my friends are better off for knowing me. just as i began to hit an all time low, i started making new friends at my new school.however my life at home has become unbearable. both my parents (more so my stepdad) abuse me emotionally and verbally at every chance they get, they get mad at the smallest things i do, only to use them as excuses to berate me. my stepdad said that i am horrible person, that the older i get the more he hates me, that i have no friends, that i am a loser who will end up on the street doing drugs like my real dad (have never touched an illegal drug in my life) eventually i lost it, told my stepdad that he was being ridiculous and he had turned me into a horrible person. this led to my stepdad attacking me, punching me in the chest so hard, breathing hurt for over a month.what makes it even worse was that i recently had a really bad pneumonia attack, nearly died. that rattled me, scared my shitless. my stepdad keeps throwing it in my face that he saved my life by driving me to the hospital when ever i have an argument with him. his verbal/emotional abuse is worse than ever, while he hasn't hit me in a long time, he gets so angry i am scared he will do it again. he calls me a pipsqueak and asks if i want a piece of him. i am scared of him, i can't fight back, as he is a massive guy with training, whereas i am short, skinny and 15. my mom takes his side in every argument. because of his abuse, i have become a shadow of my former self, feeling depressed and enraged most of the time. every time i try to build myself back up off the ground, his cruel words knock me back down into the mud. i spend most of my time detached from reality, either remembering the past, or imagining a reality were i was with my friends and was actually happy. even my thoughts don't work like they used to. my thoughts feel jagged like broken glass, it is painful and exhausting to even think, i fly from one extreme emotion to the next, from near catatonic depression, to uncontrollable fury. and whenever i show any sign of anger or sadness my parents insult and punish me for it. plz give me some advice! how do i control my rage, i am scared of what i might do one day. how do i regain my self esteem and fight my depression, i can't keep going like this, i have lost nearly all hope, please help!
fuck me in particular
it's amazing how on the inside i know i need help, and see how available it is yet i don't. it's almost as if i'm working against myself in some sort of satanic ritual where i'm addicted to sadness, even when it's killing me. i can't be the only one, right?
what do you see in my eyes? if eyes are the windows to the soul.

who needs some motivation?exercise can help your mood ‍‍♂️‍♀️

self portrait

i think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and i need some help to understand and deal with this situation.
*(tl;dr at the bottom)*although i have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. but it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  he isn't someone who talks much and i really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of i don't know.  so i thought i'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (of course i know that you can just make guesses but i'm trying really hard to understand him and i'm just so confused.)  we both have our own problems but as a couple i wouldn't say we had any major problems. in the last months his depression got worse and i tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then i just try to give him enough space. that's why we're not as close as i would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so i was patient. we didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when i came back, he broke up with me. his reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks i'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (which i think is true and at the same time isn't... it's definitely not just a friendship, but because i tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where i would like my relationship to be.)  that was two months ago. we're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. we're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   i explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   he said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  i don't know what to do. i want to give him time but as far as i know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and i can't take this much longer.   i know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. to confirm that i'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, i've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of just a friend.and now, i'm still here because i've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. i have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and i don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  **tl;dr**: boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. his reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. i have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. i'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.so... i'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly i'm looking for... i guess i just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?
i'm terrified
i'm terrified that i'm going to spend the whole of my life wanting to die. i'm scared of suicide and don't want to attempt it, but i'm also afraid of living. i'm so scared of failing the people around me but i feel like i'll do that no matter what. i haven't spoken to my best mate in days (a long time for us), and i'm both terrified of losing him and of letting him down by being a burden. i just..can't pretend to be happy with him right now, but i don't want to bring him down to my level either or worry him. hopefully he'll forget about me.... holy fuck, what if he forgets about me?i'm afraid of becoming overwhelmed by work, but i can't seem to get myself out of bed and get the work done. i'm too scared to face it.i'm scared of leaving my room in case i see roommates. i don't want to talk to them or for them to see me like this. i need to eat but i'm afraid of going out to buy food.i know i'm spiraling. i know the depression is taking over. i'm terrified of that happening, but at the same time i don't know if i want to be in control any more. i'm too scared of that too.fuck. i'm just afraid. of everything.
love
i think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.to love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.one would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.in reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. in the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of “being in love,” this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.many of us do not know what love is… little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or “being in love,” as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency… but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically… the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.love is like a multifaceted diamond. as a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable… it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable… it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.this is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. for too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant… and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security… when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.in this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved… as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could… on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love… we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it… if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.for many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us… being truthful was not as important as being safe. being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.in our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love… our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. so we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.as children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. these influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though “being in love” is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime…for many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how… a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.one of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response… however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored… this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.that is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. as if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. why? our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain… we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. why? because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty…. all of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.what our subconscious associates with safety is certainty… so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front… all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe… we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. these people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were… attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.one of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong… you've never experienced love or given love…. you've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or “being in love,” none of which on it's own is true love.to fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. the challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories… so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. here is an example from my own life:as a young adult, i knew i hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. this i knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. it wasn't until my 40s that i realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. as a baby, i didn't like porridge, so like most babies i spat it out… this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out… when i learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that i would hurry up and swallow so i could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. sad story… but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge… this is my earliest memory of subjugation… the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do… subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. it also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. it also contributed to enmeshment where i quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as i was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. here is another example from my childhood:i can't remember why, but i remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6… i was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed… as most 6 year olds would do i cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing… as an adult looking back i think this made my mum feel bad… she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much… another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that i will get punished for feeling sorry for myself… in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and i should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.for me personally, this has been my experience… my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self… this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency… all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety.it is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good… and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.so how the hell do we undo this?not easily and not quickly… it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.to undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. as a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum… but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse… our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. in order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. for me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected… this pain i was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, i meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie… it's not and never was a true representation of love… i meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents… then i let myself get angry… at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods… i got angry at the injustice of life itself… i started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off… i listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as leo morachioli “killing in the name of” and “give it away” and “sabotage.” in all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean… they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs… the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be… but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.from that point on, you can start fresh… you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. you can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you… because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.you simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. if you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? on a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone… so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself… this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others… you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need… however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got.
is it normal to think you're overcoming depression when everything you do shows otherwise?
i've had depression and anxiety for over 8 years. i feel like i'm way better than i was before but sometimes it feels i'm just lying to myself. is it normal?i feel i'm pretending i don't see this dark monster looming over me everytime i say i'm getting better. i'm on antidepressants and they help but it feels i'm going to take them forever. i tell myself i'm more social now! but i know for a fact i only talk to two friends and more often than not ignore them when they want to hang out. i feel like i care about my appearance now, but i'm heavier than ever. i feel like i care about my future but i keep missing classes because i simply cannot find the will to go. i want to have a relationship but everytime someone interested approaches me, i panic that they'll know there's something wrong with me and leave me.i'm usually very bubbly and positive on my daily life but when i stay quiet for a moment, i feel as if i have this mask that threatens to fall off and show everyone how i really am.at night i refuse to aknowledge my intrusive thoughts so i fall asleep while reading, listening to music or watching videos. am i avoiding reality? is it a good coping technique? what is it?i just can't trust my own thoughts because they were the ones that led me here so i never know if i'm taking the necessary steps towards recovery and this is a normal setback or if i'm lying to myself and pretending everything's getting better  because i can't deal with the fact i'm never going to get out of this hellhole.(.....and now i'm thinking i'm being dramatic and i need to get over it and i should not post it because maybe i'm enabling my depression every time i try to aknowledge it. damn. sorry for my english btw.)
proud of myself still keeping my shit together
the fall this year is brutal. one moment it is nice and sunny, and the next one it’s a gloomy gothic hell. it’s gonna be like that for the next 7 months where i live (think eastern europe). my therapist says she has an influx of new clients. i’m mostly okay, but sometimes i just get an urge to step into traffic. it’s been generally a shitty year. i thought i’d recovered from depression. i’ve been healthy for 4 years before that, but it’s been too much lately. i moved from my dorms to live alone, broke up with my best friend of 10 years, faced the worst creative block in my life in my first year of art school, was assaulted by a stalker, went through bureaucratic hell trying to file a police report, fucked some nasty stranger because he said i had nice butt, and, finally, experienced a bad acid trip. there were, of course, a lot of good things. i feel like i’m finally getting out of an artistic stasis and ditching drugs for good, therapy and meditation are helping lots, i kinda made up with the friend and had many great moments with other friends, and had a blast at a summer music festival. although, you know how it is - depression makes you focused on negative stuff specifically. every day i do my best to get just a little peace of mind, but it feels like a sisyphus’ task. there is always a scary tiny voice that’s telling me i don’t really deserve all of that self-care, showering and stuff, not jumping under buses, things like that. turns out, it’s possible to be ungrateful and distrustful towards your own self.the best thing that’s happening right now is that i’m finally getting the courage to tell my story (mainly, writing shitty poetry and showing it to friends. or anonymous reddit posts). i’m also going to book an appointment with a psychiatrist as soon as i have money. so we’ll see. maybe i’m not a sisyphus but the proverbial frog after all. 
i’m there for my friends whenever they need help, no one is there for me when i need it
recently a few of my friends have been hit with some form of depression, whether it’s been going on for a long time, sometimes it was more serious than other but no matter how big or small i was there for them. this has been going on for about two months.helping them has distracted me from how shitty my life has been the past few years, but now that i need help they all look the other way. i’ve been posting on snapchat asking someone to talk to me they ignore it, said that i feel upset about something and they will send me a message with no effort behind it, i have always messaged them when they need someone to talk to.they know what’s been going on in my life too, i just broke up with my girlfriend of two years and after a few months we tried to give it another go, one thing lead to another and she’s given me an std when i haven’t even looked at another girl since. they don’t know about the std but they know how upset i am over her and they all act dumb towards it. i feel so stupid :(tl;dr i help my friends when they needed it, i recently started needing a bit of help and they don’t even try.
first 7 days of coming off antidepressants

does anyone else hate themselves for not being happy?
i haven’t gone to a doctor, so i’m not entirely sure i am depressed. i haven’t been happy for a long time, and i get mad at myself for simply not being happy. i hate myself so much, especially for being depressed, but i don’t know why. i have no idea why i’m like this, but i hate myself so much. idk what to do with this. i’m really hoping one of you knows what i mean.edit: it’s like i hate myself for hating myself. i’m not sure if it’s because i feel weak or what.
carved out of soap, trying to distract myself from depression. what do you guys do that helps you feel better?

depression: an extremely practical guide to making it through your depressive episode
hey everyone! i made this guide awhile ago and posted it in /r/rbipolar and /r/depression. /r/depression removed it because their focus is not on solution-based content, but since i recently found this sub i thought i'd share it here as well. it by no means covers everything, but i'm hoping it will help some people here. depression: an extremely practical guide to making it through your depressive episode so ages ago i came across an awesome guide to dealing with a depressive episode, which helped me immensely. i have been searching high and low for it to share, but i cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. if these tips ring a bell for anyone and they can get me the original to share, or you know the author, please let me know. in the meantime, here is my very practical guide to dealing with a depressive episode, based on what i pulled and use from that article as well as my own experience. [note: i’m not a medical professional or a therapist or anything. these will not work for everyone. this is just a compiled list of things i have found useful, people i know have found useful, or i have read from other writers.]including: -the very basic basics -food -personal hygiene -keeping your house not totally gross -asking for help -summary of lists to prepare for next time **the very basic basics**1)don’t die it sort of goes without saying, but the end goal of dealing with a depressive episode is to make it through. so as long as you are still alive, good job! if you start thinking seriously about suicide, reach out and get help asap. tell a trusted friend or family member, call a suicide hotline, or call emergency services (911 in america) or go to your nearest emergency room. 2) bare minimums moving forward from that, it's a good idea to lay out what the bare minimum for your day-in-the-life of a depressive episode. and i mean the absolute bare minimum. the more things you feel like you need to do, the harder it is to get up and do any of them, so make a very short list to start off. once you are started on that list, often it's easier to continue with the momentum, but start small. for example, my list is:get out of bed at least once take meds/vitamin fill water bottle to drink throughout the day eat at least one (1) thingdo one “have to” and one “like to” (see next point) theres plenty of other things i shoot to do, like showering and teeth brushing and eating more than just a thing, but absolute worst come to worst, that's my very basic basics. 3) have to’s and like to’s try, everyday, to do one thing you have to do, and one thing you like to do. this is good because it shows you that, no matter how slowly you are moving, you are not stagnant. you are moving through this depressive episode. make your have to’s and like to’s  proportional to your energy that day. on an okay day your have to might be a load of laundry and your like to might be a long walk. on a bad day your have to might be wash one fork and your like to might be to watch a funny youtube video. baby steps. don’t worry if you are not actually enjoying your like to. depression can kill your ability to enjoy anything, and that's okay, just do something you know you usually like. it will help you notice when you are starting to come out of the episode to see yourself begin to enjoy the things you usually do. at the end of the day, as long as you are alive and doing at least what you need to to keep that up, good job! **food**so in terms of food, the name of the game is to eat some. to do that when you barely have the energy to stand up or put on pants, you are going to want food that is as easy to make as possible. also think about adding a multivitamin to your daily routine to help with the vitamin deficiencies your less-than-perfect depression diet probably has. [note: i'm not a nutritionist. note #2: i’m super white and all my examples are going to be pretty boring white-guy foods, because that's what i eat while depressed. please take the general concepts listed here and modify to better foods if you can think of them]buy stuff in advance you probably don’t want to go shopping when you’re depressed. so sometime between episodes, stock up on things you can buy in advance and store until they are needed, like canned and frozen food. i’m not going to make a big list because it varies based on what you like, but whatever it is make sure it's food you at least enjoy regularly. depression makes most things taste terrible, but if you like it usually it will be slightly easier to stomach. bonus points for things with more than one major food group in one. think things like:hearty soups/stews with protein and grainschef boyardee or other kids pasta that contains a full veggie servingfrozen tv dinners that have a protein, veggie, and grain  whatever it is, you basically want stuff with instructions that read something along the lines of “open, microwave, eat.” it’s also a good call to have some stuff in your cabinet that involve cooking, but that are easy and reheat well (see point 3). 2) grocery shopping if your episodes are long, then at some point you are going to need to go buy some food (or ask a friend to get some for you, see: asking for help). there’s nothing worse than gathering all the energy to go to the grocery store, getting overwhelmed, and ending up coming home with just a box of cereal and a block of cheese, so again, prep a list before the episode hits. this is your chance to get the things that you can’t store in advance but that will still be easy to eat. again, you want to get things that you like, and that require little to no effort to prepare. stock your fridge with cold foods you can eat as they are. it depends on the things you like, but think along the lines of yogurt chicken or tuna saladveggies you can eat raw (baby carrots are my fave) hummus cheese sandwich meat fruit (if you think you’ll eat it fast enough. mine always ends up going bad) milk (whole and soy have a bunch of protein) pre-made sandwichesetc also stock your pantry with easy to eat stuff like bread (for sandwiches or toast with peanut butter or whatever) crackers (for hummus/chicken or tuna salad/to put peanut butter on, or just to eat)cereal snacks (see below) 3) when you can cook, use that energy well if you have a day in a depressive episode when you have the energy to cook, or you have a friend over helping you, make sure you are ready to cook something that a) you like b) is still relatively easy to cook and c) you can make a bunch of and eat for awhile. as with the canned and frozen stuff, bonus points for things with multiple food groups all in one. extra bonus points if it's something you can make in one pot/pan/dish. think about these things in advance and have stuff on hand to cook. i always keep pasta (the hidden veggies kind!) and tomato sauce in my cupboard and some frozen ground turkey or beef for pasta with meat sauce. i know a lot of people who make great stir fry or curry with only a few ingredients that they can keep on hand. whatever works for you. when i’m done cooking, i like leaving it all in one big tupperware, to have fewer things to clean (see: keeping your house not totally gross) but i know other people prefer dividing it into meal-sized containers so they don’t have to worry about choosing serving sizes. 4) snacks! make them useful sometimes meals are tough. no worries, snacks are easier! but in choosing snacks, work towards ones that add up to the calorie and protein/vitamin content of a real meal. you are also probably going to eat some chocolate, which is totally cool, but think about adding something like nuts/trail mixgranola protein/granola bars beef jerkya giant spoonful of peanut butter (i know i’ve mentioned peanut butter a lot but it's so easy and good) or other foods with similar benefits5) drinks drink water. as much as those “all you need to cure your depression is 8 glasses of water a day” posts are utter bs, water is extremely important and you need it to not die. water bottles are easier to keep around than cups, so grab a water bottle you can keep on the couch/in your bed with you, and drink up. whole milk and soy milk both have a lot of protein per serving, and almond milk has a ton of vitamins. if you have a really hard time motivating yourself to eat, but there's a meal replacement/supplement you can drink, give it a go. ensure or carnation instant breakfast or something along those lines. if you find a protein powder that isn’t super gross, that's good too. try not to rely too heavily on these, but they make a great addition to food. drinks with a bunch of vitamins like v8 are a great addition as well. v8 also has a line of fruit and veggie drinks if you are like me and thing tomato juice itself is hella gross. smoothies? i’m a big fan, but a whole blender can be a lot to clean for some people. i’m not talking crazy recipes with fresh kale and blueberries and 14 types of fish oil, but milk, a frozen banana, and chocolate chips is an easy, filling snack.no booze. i know there's a temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol, but seriously it's a bad idea. alcohol is a depressant on its own, and will probably make things worse. also it will make you more dehydrated and whatnot. just stay clear until you’re feeling better. and drink water. i said it before, but again, make sure you drink enough water. **personal hygiene**ok so this one gets tricky, because i don’t want to be the one saying like, “meh, it's fine to bail on basic personal hygiene things” but when push comes to shove, if you can’t do 100%, it's good to have a compromise instead of doing 0%. so, a few points: 1) teeth:if you only have the energy to brush once a day, make it right before bed.mouthwash is not as good as brushing your teeth, but it’s way easier, so in a pinch, grab some listerine, swish and spit. 2) showers feeling gross will make you feel worse, so try to prioritize a shower of some  kind every other day or so, based on your energy level. you can compromise the amount of things you do in the shower to motivate yourself to get in. so instead of your 14-step shower routine with shampoo and conditioner and soap and that fancy exfoliating body wash, etc, tell yourself “i’m going to get in the shower, and i’m going to wash my armpits, and then i can just stare blankly at the floor until i run out of hot water.” odds are, once you get in there and have the soap in hand, you’ll be able to keep the momentum going and wash the rest of you. if not, at least you don’t have stinky pits anymore, and that's cool too. washing your hair is also a good thing, because it will overall make you feel less gross, but don’t let that become the tipping point that makes a shower too hard. some people have found success with dry shampoo if that's easier. if you can’t manage a shower, have some baby wipes on hand that you can at least hit your pits with now and then. again, these are awkward things to compromise on, but on your worst days anything is better than nothing. 3) face baby wipes are also awesome for your face if you don’t have the energy to wash. 10/10 would recommend. 4) baby wipes in general baby wipes are just in general great. keep some in your bathroom for face/body washing, keep some by wherever you hole up when depressed (bed, couch, comfy chair) for wiping hands off after eating. anything you need to be clean and you don’t have the energy to do in the traditional way, baby wipes can help. 5) have a routine if you have all your morning/evening bathroom stuff in a detailed routine usually, then it's easier to do it all on autopilot on your sort-of-okay depression days. ie: always brush teeth first, then get in shower, wash hair first, then wash body, then wash face, then get out of shower, then dry off, then moisturize, etc. autopilot is depressions friend, and also when your memory is iffy, it's easier to not have to think “wait, did i brush my teeth before i got in the shower? was that three days ago? who knows.” 5) clothes wearing the same sweatpants for 4 days in a row isn't great, but really not the end of the world, so don’t stress too much. clean clothes can make you feel better though, so change when you have the energy. a good rule of thumb is to never put dirty clothes on a second time. if you have already taken an item of clothing off, as tempting as it is to just grab the same sweatpants off the floor after your shower, grab a fresh pair. you are already 75% of the way there. grab clean underwear once a day when you go to the bathroom, and when you sit and your pants are down anyway, switch them out. if you start running out of clean clothes, laundry is usually pretty daunting, so thats a good time to pull in a favor from a friend (see: asking for help). long story short, do as much as you can to keep clean, but don’t let being unable to keep up with your usual standards keep you from doing anything at all. do what you can and consider anything you can manage a win.**keeping your house not totally gross**the more gross your house is, the harder it seems to clean it and the more daunting that becomes. also, embarrassment about a messy home can cause a lot of people to isolate because they don’t want people to come over, either just for company or to help. so, ideally, you want to keep a mess from getting too bad. so here’s some tips 1) trashdon’t bother with trash cans. ok hear me out on this one, trash cans are a nuisance. you’ve got to put a clean trash bag in, walk all the way over to the trash can to put stuff in, try not to overfill it, probably overfill it anyway, then have to really cram stuff in there to take the bag out, take the bag out, bring the bag to your dumpster/outdoor trash can, put a new bag in. that's way too much work.  instead, grab a bunch of plastic (or paper) grocery bags, and hang them on doorknobs around your home. put one in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, living room, ect. make sure you also have one near wherever you hole up when depressed (bed/couch/chair). just toss your trash in there when you exit a room, and it keeps trash in much more manageable amounts. when it’s full you can just tie it off and pop a new one on. or if someone is coming over and you have the energy to straighten up, just walk around and grab all the bags. done! 2) dishes ain’t nobody got time for dishes. piles of dishes around your kitchen make it harder to eat, which makes it harder to have energy. buy yourself some paper plates/bowls and plastic forks and spoons and use those for easy cleanup. seriously, it's a life-saver. i recommend buying some on clearance after a holiday, because it's not like these are for impressing anyone, what do you care if you’re eating out of a halloween bowl in june? when you are done, pop those suckers in your nearby trash bag and you’re good to go. if any of your easy-cooking stuff involves roasting/baking, consider also grabbing some oven-safe baking tins that can be thrown out after a use or two. 3) disinfectant wipesif your episodes are long enough that it’s unreasonable to not do any cleaning through the whole thing, disinfectant wipes are a great way to clean things super fast. just grab a clorox wipe or whatever and give your kitchen/bathroom countertops a quick wipedown. make sure you have these on hand before the episode kicks in, so it's one less thing to grab on your trips out of the house. 4) overall overall, try your best but don’t worry. nobody expects you to be dusting and vacuuming your house when you have the flu, no one (including you) should expect that when you're in a depressive episode. if you are going to give cleaning up a go, but have limited energy, try committing 5 minutes to cleaning the space closest to wherever you hole up, usually a coffee table or night stand. if you are going to have one space clean, it might as well be the space you probably spend the most time staring at. ask for help before it gets too bad. it's easy to fall into a trap where your house gets really bad, and it's overwhelming to clean, but it's also so messy that you are embarrassed to have someone over, even a friend to help with the mess, which just exacerbates the problem. if it's getting pretty bad, but not embarrassingly bad yet, thats a good time to call a friend (see: getting help). or even if it is embarrassingly bad, still ask for help. again, you’re sick, it's okay to be a mess. **asking for help**a strong support system is your best way to get through an episode. having people you can rely on, emotionally and practically, can go a huge way towards helping you through the episode. 1) again, don’t die i’m going to say it again, above all else you want to make it through the episode. if you are seriously thinking of hurting yourself in any way, or are having thoughts of suicide, reach out immediately and get help by telling a trusted friend or family member, calling a suicide hotline, calling emergency services (911 in america) or going to your nearest er. 2) explain your depression before an episodetalk to the people who care about you about the fact that you have depression, and what a depressive episode looks like for you. if they give you the “yeah, okay, i get sad sometimes too” face, you might need to do some work to get them to understand how bad it can be and why you might need their help. if they give you the “oh sh*t, that sucks so much for you that you have depression, i get that because i understand how bad depression can be” face, then they are a good person to ask for help. 3) ask for explicit, practical help from friends and family when you say you’re having an episode, a lot of people will say “aw, well let me know if there's anything i can do to help.” they say this because most people want to, but have no frigging clue how to help you. and it's true they can’t make you not depressed anymore, but they can help in practical ways. when you come across a task that needs to be done, but that you don’t have the energy for, its a good time to call a friend. they will likely be happy that they get to help you, because they love you and want to, and they will be happy to not have to worry or guess how to best do so. so ask for specific things. when they say “is there anything i can do to help?” say something like:“yeah, actually. i know it's kind of weird to ask, but my laundry is piling up and i need a hand with it. any chance you could come over and help? we can watch a movie while it's in the washer.”“yeah, i really need to do dishes but i’m having a hard time motivating myself. can you come over and give me a hand? i think i would do better at it with company.”“yeah, somehow being unable to get out of bed for 3 days has made my apartment gross and i don’t know where to start. can you help?”“hey, i really need some food, but i’m having a hard time getting to the store. if i gave you a list, could you pick some things up for me? i’ll pay you back for them.” its weirdly personal to ask for help with this sort of stuff, but your loved ones who say they are there to help are actually there to help, you just need to tell them how. also, of course, use your own language when asking for help. mine is a lot less formal and a lot more “hey, one of you nerds should bring my depressed ass some chinese food.” but whatever works for you and your support system. 4) be specific in what you need socially in the same way you need practical needs met, it will also be helpful to you and your loved ones if you are explicit with what you need from them socially. . this is going to depend dramatically on how being around other people affects your depression. a lot of us tend towards isolation, and for some that's effective, but for others it helps more to be in the company of others. it’s okay to not be yourself or be the life of the party, so if you want company, say so. again, be specific. you can ask a friend: “hey, i need some company, but i don’t have energy to go anywhere or do anything. want to come over and watch a movie while i lay on my couch?” or, if it would be good to get out of the house, but you don’t have much energy, same thing:“hey, i still have way too much depression for doing things, but i need a change of scenery. can i come lay on your couch while you do stuff?” if a group of friends invite you out to do something, and you’d like to even though you will be a wet blanket, tell them that. if you warn them, then you won't feel bad about not being yourself. you can say:“i’d love to join, but i’m still dealing with a depressive episode, so i will probably just sit there. that okay?”or if a group of friends are going out/one friend wants to hang out, and you don’t want to, it can be good to let them know if they should keep inviting you places. say something like i think my depression is still acting up too much to come out tonight. thanks for inviting me, though. i appreciate knowing you still want me around, so please keep asking me even if i keep saying no. eventually i’ll be able to say yes again. ori’m probably going to be too depressed to go out for a little while. i feel really bad that i have to keep saying no, so how about i tell you when i’m feeling better and we can start hanging out again. however be careful when creating long-term distance from people. you need some people checking in on you, so it’s okay to isolate from acquaintances and casual friends who you don’t have the energy for, but make sure to have some close friends around.5) talking to casual acquaintances it's tricky to explain depression to people who don’t understand, so in the middle of an episode it takes a lot of unnecessary effort to explain it to casual acquaintances. people like coworkers, friends-of-friends, distant relatives you don’t like, etc aren’t owed that level of information about you if you don’t want to get into it. that is not to say depression is anything shameful or something you should hide. a lot of people feel empowered by being open about it, but personally i just find it inconvenient with that level of acquaintance. everyone has their own tactic for explaining whats going on, so use whatever works for you. it's a good thing to think about in advance, so you are not suddenly caught off guard by a coworker asking why you’ve been so off lately. whatever it is you want to say, know in advance how much and what you’d like to share. since mental illnesses are illnesses, it's totally fair to refer to an episode as “being sick.” the conversation i use most frequently goes as follows. you okay? you’ve seemed off lately.yeah, i’ve been sick. i’ll be fine. oh no, do you have that [cold/stomach bug/allergies] that has been going around?no, its part of like, a whole thing *gestures vaguely to all of me* it happens sometimes, but i’ll be okay. oh okay, well i hope you feel better. that establishes that 1) yes, something is going on but 2) i clearly don't want to talk about it. 3) i’ll be fine so don't worry and 4) leave me alone. i use a variation of that explanation for calling out of work, canceling plans with acquaintances, explaining why i’m not super peppy at work, etc. again, use whatever language and level of sharing you feel comfortable with, just think about it in advance. 6)getting professional help if you are at the point where a guide like this is necessary, you probably also need help from a pro. nothing to be ashamed of; no one would expect you to beat cancer without the help of a doctor, no one should expect you to handle depression alone either. i'm not going to go into detail about how to find a doc, since it differs dramatically based on your insurance/money/location, but its important. getting to a doc is a good task to call in a favor from a friend if you need. you might have friends saying you should really talk to a doctor about this. tell them yes, i want to, but i do not have the energy to make that happen. here is the log-in to my insurance's website, can you find a doctor for me and stand here while i call and schedule an appointment? if you have to. i'm also not going to make any claims on how to treat your depression in terms of medication, talk therapy, diet, etc, but i will say this: talk to your doctor and seriously consider any and all recommendations they offer, including medication. summary of lists to prepare for next time phew! okay, that’s the guide. so to summarize the things you should prep before an episode:lists to make:your list of absolute bare minimums for every day depression grocery shopping list of foods that are easy but can’t be purchased in advancethings to have:good canned/frozen foods in your pantry/freezer that require no prepstorable food items that need to be cooked, but are easystorable healthy snacksmouthwash, baby wipes, and dry shampoo if you’re into that plastic/paper bags for trash paper plates, bowls, and cupswaterproof box with a lid for dishes disinfectant wipes for cleaning people to talk to/things to think abouttalk to people in your support system to see who understands depression; educate those who do not explain the type of help you might needthink about what level of detail you want to share with various people so you are prepared for when they ask please add any useful tips i missed in the comments, and again, if anyone can find the original guide that a lot of these came from, please lmk/post it in the comments. hope this helps! stay safe friends! 
i love you all so much. i am currently fighting many personal demons but i wanted to let you all know your not alone. i have never felt more hopeless and i have never had darker thoughts. wish you all happiness and positivity, i understand your pain.

this hit me harder than i thought it would

could really use a hug rn
my gf of 4 years broke up with me a little over a year ago and it was due to my lack of noticing habits i has that were toxic, and for the way i dealt with depression about previous life altering events in my life.  as it stands right now we had our differences but she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. she helped me grow into a mature adult when i was still doing stupid young man shit. she taught me how to be financially stable. she always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. and she showed me how to really love unconditionally.ever since the break up my father has passed away and she wasn't really there to help me through it which i can't blame her for but still kinda hurt. we've talked from time to time since then. today she mentioned about a trip she was planning to take in july with the new guy she has been seeing. yes we are broken up and that's that, however feelings that are lingering still just hurt. i'm beating myself up over the fact of how much i let myself down and let her slip away. i've made a promise to myself to never take that kind of love for granted again and never treat another partner like that. right now i guess i just miss all the good time we had and can't see it with anyone else. been hoping this whole time that maybe we would end up hanging out and get back to a more mature relationship. not the case. i could use a hug. thanks for reading everyone.
please
i hate this. i hate feeling this way. i’ve never had a real job, i’ve never had fulfillment, i’m not worth a damn and things would 100% be better off without me. i’m a waste of time, space, energy, and money for everyone i know.
i feel hopeless. i can not deal. i'm almost there again
i try so hard.   but it's really really hard.   i have learning disabilities and no one around that cares.   i'm not like some of the people who think they're depressed on here.   i've been struggling for far too long.
how to be completely honest with my therapist
there’s some things i leave out when i meet with her. i think my main issue is that i care too much about trying to impress her instead of being honest. i meet with her at the end of next month, how do i all of a sudden begin to be open?
quit my job due to high levels of anxiety. can't build the courage to conduct exit interview
i've been with the same company for just over 4 years, but the last year has really taken a toll on my mental and physical health. i have panic attacks before work, throw up due to anxiety. cry at my desk.on wednesday, i caught myself thinking 'if a car crash was promised on my way to work, it'd be easier to get out of bed right now.' so i quit, effective immediately.i understand this might be a hit immature, but it i told my supervisor 3 or 4 weeks ago after a mental breakdown that i needed reduced hours, or a sabbatical, or something to have time to get myself right, but the work just kept pushing forward.now our ceo wants to conduct a exit interview, and just opening my email app to offer times sends me into a panic. i tried to schedule a time earlier today and ended up crying myself to sleep.so here i am. on one hand i feel like a huge weight has been lifted, on the other hand i am absolutely dreading this last hurdle.i'm not sure what i am looking for.thanks.
i want to kill myself really badly, but don’t have the guts to do so
i hate my life. i hate my lack of confidence. i hate my own beliefs and opinions. i hate everywhere i go. i hate how women just hate me. i hate how everyone calls me a cringelord and a beta male and faggot. i can’t take it anymore. i don’t even care what my family thinks, i just want to die. what should i do? should i ask the doctor to prescribe me ketamine or something? speaking of my doctor, i’ve been to 4+ therapists in my life, and none of them helped me. i feel like i have no where else to go. what should i do?
❤️

made a significant step towards happiness.
deleted instagram and snapchat off my phone. yeah. this may sound stupid as fuck but instagram and snapchat were holding me back significantly. i felt like those apps were making my condition go crazy almost everyday. glad i made this step towards a better life.
how to motivate myself to study since the exams are coming up but my mind keep telling me that it doesn't matter and just fucking end it

i feel like my mental health is deteriorating constantly being someone’s emotional support, i don’t know what to do.
i have a friend who regularly comes to me for emotional support. she’s my friend, so of course i do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, it’s becoming a toxic situation because i’ve been feeling pretty down myself, and it’s been taking a toll on my emotional well-being. i honestly don’t mean to sound selfish at all, i really want to help her but i feel like it’s too much for me to handle.it’s a tough situation because i feel like i’m not fit to be her emotional support as i’m going through things myself and i haven’t been feeling great for a while but i don’t think i can tell her that, i know she’s going through a lot.sometimes i have a meltdown because i feel so much pressure and stress, i don’t know how to reply to her, i don’t know how to handle it. feels like we don’t talk about anything else other than her problems, and i really want to help but it’s so hard.i know she relies on me for support a lot.it’s been a few years since this has been happening. she’s always coming to me, and i’m pretty sure only me and i feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness. i don’t want her to feel like she’s a burden to me, though i can’t help feeling this way.has anyone been in this sort of situation ? what can i do? thanks for reading.
i can’t describe what i felt anymore
it will be 2months already since she broke up with me. i already give up to the thoughts that we will be back from each other cause it’s really impossible. she’s already happy with her someone new. for me i already accept it and it’s good to know that she’s happy already. but its still hurt a lot to the point that there’s no more tears to cry. my chest is feeling numb to the pain that i’m feeling. my emotions is like a roller coaster right now i’m feeling hurt later. i feel empty sad and later on i feel nothing no emotion. i don’t know at what point of life is me right now
maybe???
i believe that my depression derives from my constant thoughts of existence. maybe if i were to find out my purpose for living i wouldn't be as depressed as i am.
feeling guilty and tired of looking for helps
(i think) i've felt depressed since 2 years because of study, family, relations, future work, etc.wednesday 8, i posted a thing here and was given some advice (thank you) friday 10, i decided to go to the hospital. and i was admitted right away.still, during the hospitalisation that lasted 10 days, i didn't feel better.they treated me with valium and then started antidepressant monday after admission.&#x200b;now i'm back home, with my own depressive habits.i don't want to talk everyone around me, even my best friend because i'm feeling guilty of being their burden.it seems that i repeated everything to everyone over and over again. every time i've talked about myself is even causing me more depression but still with no solution... reaching for help is very tiring for me. and i'm tired of this shit in my head right now. i just want to get back to my work and be happy with everyone around me.
can't get over my ex even though i want to
my ex from three years ago made it clear that she doesn't ever want to talk, and i don't want to push the boundaries further than i already have. i can't stop obsessing (therapist suggested i might have ocpd) about her and all of the horrible things she did to me during our relationship and break up. i have been trying as hard as i can to get over her but i can't; therapy and psychiatry doesn't help, new girls don't help, working on myself doesn't help. i don't want to become an incel-type of guy but these thoughts are ruining my life. i just want to talk to her but i know i can't, and i don't want to start feeling entitled to her attention. my depression and anxiety just keep getting worse and worse because of this and i haven't felt genuine joy in years. i don't want to feel like this anymore, please help.

me and my partner are both depressed, but him much more than me
i've(20m) been with my boyfriend(21m) for a little over 2 years. i've always struggled with depression on and off through my life and suffered some severe trauma as a kid. i haven't been to a therapist more than twice in my life.my partner has had depression ever since he was a kid, he says it's been constant and sometimes he doesn't notice it as much but he says he's always been very depressed. he has never been to a therapist.we struggle a lot with our relationship. i want so bad to help him and make him feel better. we're a great pair, add a lot to eachother, and understand each other's problems and worries really well. but, while i feel i can kinda manage my depression and it hasn't stopped me from functioning before, he is completely debilitated. a lot of the things we do together seem to make him upset, bored, or irritated - and these are some of our favorite things to do together. i've felt that way before too, and i understand he's just as frustrated as i am, but i feel lost when it happens and i dont understand how i can fix it.i have a really strong fear of abandonment and i cling really hard onto him when i'm at my worst. it's really bad because when he's upset he pulls away, he's afraid of hurting me and others and he directs all his frustration inwards. but by pulling away i pull him harder and its a vicious cycle that leads to us crying and me freaking out, having a near panic attack because he's been ignoring me. i don't know how to help him, how to be there for him, i dont even know how to help myself. i let him know he can talk to me and he does and i usually end up trying to give advice. sometimes i just listen but i dont know what to say afterwards, i know he doesnt want advice but how else do i respond or stop the conversation from hitting dead silence or repetetive uh-huh's. i love this man, he's the love of my life. i want to spend forever with him. but im terrified of losing him, of hurting him, of failing him. how can we support eachother? how do i try and comfort him, and how do i communicate what i need without fear of being too needy?right now we are both very poor and in college. i have a free therapist on campus i can visit, but his school doesnt have that and he would have to pay to visit a therapist, which we absolutely cannot afford.
crying over nothing.
does anyone else not want to go outside and if they do end up having to talk to someone feel like crying. last month or so i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (while already having adhd diagnosis at 1st grade) and i've not wanted to leave my apartment or go to class and i hate it. i went to class the other day and talked to my teacher about what's been going on and why i've missed class and i almost cried in front of her... whenever i go out and about to get groceries i feel like there is a tickle in my eyes as if i want to cry and just go home. i used to never really do this, i used to never cry in public, it's just very weird to me... 
i need help im really sick
i am trying to get over a girl. romantically is ok, i understand shes not interested, but she wont even talk to me and be friends. i have zero friends. the times we talked were some of the few i didnt feel miserable or hoping to die.i get suicidal. i really do feel suicidal. but i always message her and tell her and beg for help. she used to respond but not any more. i was always serious but i always waited for her to help. i know it was very selfish but i genuinely wanted to die. i did it today just now. i want her to come and stop me and say she cares but i dont think so.but i really do want to die. what do i do :(
i’m done.
i’m done.i don’t know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but i feel like bursting into tears. by all standards my life should be great. loving parents, amazing spouse, good in-laws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. but i just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, i feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. i’m an adult. what could i possibly be sad about?i tell people around me i don’t feel right, like how i’m abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. everyone dismisses me. not a rude way but, in a manner like “hey man we all feel that way sometimes.” my loved ones around me feels so needy, like if i were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. i sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself.my day to day job is being a doctor, i get to help people and it makes me feel like i have purpose. but it’s not enough. i try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. but it’s not enough. i try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends.  but it’s not enough. i still feel sad.i reach out on forums for depression and ask “do i have a problem?” “is it normal to feel this way?” and not even the masses have comments for me. i don’t want to commit suicide because i would feel too responsible for the pain and mess i left behind. but if i was told tomorrow is my last day, i don’t think i would fight it much. i feel like help only comes if you do something dramatic. it makes me appreciate how brave people are for reaching out for help. posting this is the best i can do. i’m not sure if anyone will read this, but if you do, thank you.
i just want/need someone to talk to. desperately!!!

active duty military feeling trapped and depressed
i'm active duty military, currently age 19. e-1 rank. i join last year at the beginning of june. my rate is ctm because that is slightly relevant i guess. i hate life and am going into constant debt. i am shore duty. i do not make enough to support myself despite housing being covered. i don't know how to get help. scared it'll threaten my job to say anything. i don't have a vehicle or license and none of my ship mates will give me a ride so i have to uber to work. my work schedule also conflicts with galley times so i have to pay for my own food. i also have a necessary phone bill and internet bill. also was not paid today like i was supposed to be. i don't know what to do. where to start. i don't know if i even have the will to start looking. also been single for the last 3 years. not unattractive just unlucky maybe. i dunno. i'm jealousy ridden and anxiety filled. i don't know how to do anything except my job. and i'm not even very good at that tbh. help. edit: i just go to work then back to my barracks every day. can't afford to go anywhere else.
thank you all
i few weeks ago i posted needing support and this is my update. i went through some horrible things and had to do things to keep myself going. i was clouded by fear and emptyness i just kept tripping and falling g deeper. i then proceeded to try to commit suicide by od and failed. doctor said if i had 5 more mg it would've done it. but he said you may be dead right now mentally but your body physically fought to live. showing that you can still find peace which changed me. it made me feel emotion. it made me smile. it made me rebirth into what i am now. i still have dark times but i know i can always get up and fuck the world. and so no i'm here tpying to in hope that one person will see this and give them hope or feelings to live and go another day. to give them the motivation j was starved of for years and what costed me friendships. it will be hard guys . you will have to make hard decisions and may have to cut relations . you may even have to rebirth yourself spirtually. but you must always keep fighting i believe in you all! ❤️ also s/o to u/ellisstone for getting me though this
is everything you think you know about depression wrong? | society

cannot motivate myself at all... help.
i've been dealing with depression for a while and anxiety too. i am in a viscous circle. this semester in college started out great...was getting a's on everything, doing generally really well. then i found out that my grandmother who i'm super close to was being put in hospice care and is very very sick with heart failure. then my grandfather passed away suddenly. i feel like my professors don't believe me, because it happened weeks apart from each other. i stopped going to class, dropped one because i didn't go to an exam. i literally have not been able to get myself to write papers for one of my classes. i feel like i'm losing it. i haven't done laundry in weeks and have no clean clothes. i made an appointment with a psychiatrist but didn't show up. same thing with an appointment for an advisor to ask for help choosing classes. i just didn't show up, no call no show.  i've been desperately trying to fix myself but i get overwhelmed anytime i start studying or researching for this paper. i'm too ashamed to seek help because i didn't show up to previous appointments.&#x200b;editing because i feel like i ended this thought too soon:&#x200b;i have become really good at seeming fine and normal, but i'm just lying at this point. i feel so much guilt about everything so it's like some fucked up defense mechanism to at least appear okay. but i'm lying. if anyone has advice on how to push past this absolute avolition and apathy... so i can stop feeling guilty and lying about my situation.
how do i love myself?
i've been really feeling depression for about 2 years now, and i've found that being productive and learning about myself has really helped. i just feel so dependent on other people to make me feel good about myself, and i want to know some ways i can feel loved by myself.
7 things i’m doing regularly to feel more confident

taking the big step and waiting to talk about my life. day 1 of my life begins today

going through an episode & my bf is having a boys day
my boyfriend is perfect and precious and the best at being supportive. all of my friends are his guy friends (all the girl friends i’ve tried to make just hasn’t worked out, don’t get me wrong i love them but hanging out with most of them just leaves me drained) but he needs just a boy’s day. i’m having a major depressive episode but want to be a good girlfriend and let him have the house. but i don’t want to get out of bed for 8 hours :/
how do i cope with un-ending sadness
so my partner has been dealing with sadness and suicidle thoughts all their entire life its so extremely hard to help them i do help every time we are together its perfect absolutely perfect for both of us i am everything to them and i help as much as i possibly can but theres only so much i can do as we arent together every single minute. they have been hurt by their previous partner and emotional damage from their moms emotional and physical abuse in the past ranging from brith i think until her 5th grade year thats when the physical abuse (slapping cornering shoving head under bathtub water pushing into walls) but the emotional abuse has continued until this year about a few months ago their mom has been very extremely nice to her randomly for no reason. my partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. i am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. she had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 5/7 days now.
i think i give up
i tried to talk to people and got pushed away. i tried a therapist and she didn't help. i tried to get a better lifestyle. i am tired of faking it, feeling tired off everything, crying myself to sleep and waking up scared and sweating, and most of all i am tired of people saying that they are their for me and turn their backs when i need help. i just want a hug i want to feel like i mean something to someone even just for a moment. but i am giving up it will never happen. i am sorry for bugging any of you. just need to say what i was thinking. i'm sorry..

how to save a life-- my nightmare
i was listening to how to save a life by the fray and it just hit me how many people who are listening have probably lost their loved ones and felt helpless at some point because they failed to save them. idk why but the idea was so potent and charged with such strong sentiments that for a second i urged myself to trade shoes with one of these people and the feeling had me crying so hard. i felt idle, like a disappointment, like i failed someone i didn't even know who in a way relied on me to end their misery but instead i just watched them slip away into thin air while my hands were cuffed. the desire to reach out and grab their hand with every muscle in my feeble body was there but not strong enough to cast off the shackles of oblivion, ignorance and apathy. as the song went on , i was still trapped in this body of a someone who didn't know how to save a life. a life that felt incredibly real and close to me even though it was a mere figment of my broken imagination. the idea of this person drowning in a sea of dark wishes, hopeless thoughts and broken hearts had me gasping for a nonexistent power to just invade my own imagination and toy with the plot, hoping for a happy ending one that unfortunately wasn't meant to be. as the video neared its ending i began to imagine the countless lives ending as i stood inert,helpless and hopeless. i wished i could save all of them but i soon realized that i don't know how to save a life and neither did those people.
so hard to be alive
just like my name suggests... throwaway for obvious reasonsevery now and then i always think about how hard it is for a human being to stay alive. like, there's all these standards you have to live up to, there's all these people judging you all the time, so many factors.i have a partner that always tells me off every day for very random reasons. today it was because of a girl that added me on social media and i pressed accept, but i haven't talked to her; we just met during a trip that we all went on recently.i quit my 6 year job recently to pursue an entrepreneurship, now swimming in debt because my product isn't ready to launch yet and i have zero income (actually i have negative income because i still need to pay employees)my partner wanted to get a dog so now we have a puppy that i have to deal with during the day whilst still working on my useless startup that's not going anywhere. i lack motivation every day because i already feel exhausted dealing with this puppy...i have no friends, well actually maybe i do have friends but firstly i'm afraid of talking to them because i don't want to get judged, and also because if i do, i have no idea how my partner's going to react (as most of them are female).ehhh.. i'm just ranting now, i don't expect anyone here to even give any shits about me really -- you don't know me, i don't know you, why would anyone care?how does a human stay alive?&#x200b;&#x200b;you know what i always think -- there's so much stress in my life that it's actually so much easier to just kill myself and be done with itthink about it this way right, if you're dead there's nothing to worry about because you're dead.. how good is that? there's absolutely nothing for you to even care aboutit's like the easiest and fastest way out of every single problemyou know what also, i look at my puppy and i feel that even her life is better than mine. she has nothing to worry about, all she need to do is to complain and she'll get pats, cuddles and food. when she's bored she can just fuck around without any care in the world.&#x200b;i wish i was dead. but i'm afraid of painmaybe someone can tell me the fastest way out of this mess?&#x200b;this post is such a waste of time, if anyone actually read this far, i'm sorry for wasting your time. i probably shouldn't have even posted this.&#x200b;oh i didn't read the rules... given that this is a new throwaway, i'm guessing this post will get deleted anyways. thanks for letting me rant into the trash section
during your leave,what helped you guys from depression?
after 7 years long battle of letting depression take over my life, something has finally snapped and now i'm taking over my life. i'm dropping the year off. yay!! my friends told me to think about it again but i know that this is the only thing that will help me out. so what helped you guys during your leave days?
first my mother, tyen my best friend

when love is not love
for those of us, who as a result of childhood trauma, suffer from codependency, depression, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or feelings of unlovableness, our view and understanding of what love is, is likely not the view or understanding of others who did not suffer childhood trauma.an infant or child has an underdeveloped sense of self and other. therefore, when parents divorce it is common for a child to blame themselves and internalize the marital breakup as being their fault.similarly, in an abusive childhood, on a visceral level, a child is taught that he is worthless, unlovable, defective, lacking on some fundamental level. an infant or child may not even consider that the parents abusive actions are not deserved. when such a child survives the trauma into adulthood they may learn that the way they were treated was not right, however, no amount of logical reasoning easily removes the deeply imbedded feelings of worthlessness, defectiveness, shame, guilt and unlovableness. why? because the child has learnt a core belief on a deep primal and emotional level. the child does not question if he is lovable, he knows in his core, without thinking, that he for a fact is unlovable, worthless, defective and that he should feel intense shame and guilt for talking about it.is there hope? is there a way to undo this terrible damage? it seems that it is not possible on a purely logical reasoning level. this has been my personal truth my whole life and i am now 44. in deep discussions with my wife i confirmed my suspicions that my view of love is not the view of love of those who have not suffered childhood trauma. for those without childhood trauma, love is not something that completes them, it adds to and enhances the complete individual that they already are.on the other hand, for those of us who are survivors of childhood trauma, at a core level we believe we are defective, unlovable, worthless, incomplete. our adolescence taught us that love is the thing that we need in order to fill this inconsolable pain in our heart. we fantasize about love, we fall in love with the idea of being in love, such aspirations fill us with a sense of longing and desperation to ease our internal pain. the only problem is, is that all too often, this does not happen. even if we find someone who truly loves us for who we are, they never seem to be able to fill that chasm in our soul. the reason for this is because we were taught to believe, and we thoroughly believed an incredible lie our entire lives. what is that lie? the lie we were taught was that we do not deserve consistent love because we are worthless and unlovable. as a teenager we become desperate for the love, attention, validation and approval of others and we take over the role of our parents and we tell ourselves that our feeling lovable and worthy depends entirely on someone else finding us lovable and worthy. therefore, we spend our time looking for that special person to complete our defectiveness… and of course, in our imagination we find them from time to time… but after the honeymoon period wears off and each persons individuality sets back in, we are again left with this gaping hole in our very being that our partner no longer seems to be able to fill.these are things i have only come to grip with this week. like everything, i expect it to take quite some time to heal and to learn new coping strategies. now when i hear a love song i think, “hmmm… that's a good enmeshment song.” yesterday i listened to a long list of my favorite desperate love songs from the 1980s,  songs that triggered in me that sense of desperately needing someone to fill the hole in me where love is suppose to be. with every song, while the emotional memory of defectiveness was triggered, i gently reminded myself that this emotion is a lie… so far, this has been my strategy… not to simply identify and correct internal dialogue, but to connect with the emotional triggering memory as intensely as possible while doing so… today i feel much better, and able to collect my thoughts and share them with you because sometimes our view of love is not in fact love, instead we have a foundation of self hate that we want others to fill because our parents did not.
i’ve been told by multiple people that care about me to seek help from a therapist, but every time i’ve seen one my anxiety goes through the roof because i have to share intimate details of my life with a stranger.
how can i convince myself that it is the right decision to get help when it just feels like every time i try i slip back into bad habits.
most likely will be laid off tomorrow. i can't go through this again. i just can't.
have been struggling to rebuild my life after my first layoff in 2016. finally got a job i love in my industry last november. today layoffs were announced. i was the last hired so will likely be laid off tomorrow. i owe tens of thousands to credit cards that i have been partially living off since my first layoff, plus student loans, plus 25k in penalties to the irs for taking money from my ira to pay my mortgage. my industry is fucked and i will not be finding another job that pays over minimum wage. i dont think i can handle this again. i am not strong enough. 
need someone to talk to
need someone to talk me down. i don't know where to go or what i'm doing just help me
wife is depressed and i need advice
my wife and i have been married for 8 years, but she’s been dealing with depression for the past 10 months. these last 2 weeks are just a mental roller coaster with her crying all the time and saying that she feels empty. i try to cheer her up by taking her out to different activities, walking and playing with our dogs, telling jokes to make her laugh, and everything else that i’ve been doing as a husband during our marriage. during her current depressive episode, she admitted to me that she took 8 sleeping pills instead of the 2 recommended per the prescription, which only made her drowsy the next day. i am conflicted on what to do because she doesn’t want to touch me or me touching her and she always just wants to be alone, even the dogs can’t cheer her up. i’m at my breaking point trying to walk this line and not say something that i would regret, but i need advice on what to do. i love her very much, but it is very stressful dealing with someone who doesn’t want to meet me in the middle.edit: i forgot to mention, she is already seeing a psychiatrist and that is who prescribed the sleeping pills.
thinking of you, pete
it broke my heart to read pete davidson’s message about his suicidal ideation. i find him to be a very real person in the midst of the fabricated reality that is the entertainment industry and his honesty about how his life is tormented with borderline personality disorder and suicidal ideation is a reality that i have close experience in, given my education and work history in the mental health field. it is evident that pete is trying his best to cope with his breakup while juggling his daily battle in feeling uncomfortable in his own skin. by sharing his struggle with bpd, he is demonstrating enormous courage by revealing his humanity on a very public platform- a vulnerability that’s too often ridiculed by criticisms despite his noble efforts of trying to help others. obviously, helping others and spreading joy through laughter gives him a sense of purpose by helping him cope with “not wanting to be on this earth”- an earth that has lately been invalidating and capitalizing on his very real and very raw suffering. i hurt when i read his message because anyone with true empathy and compassion can feel his hurt in the way he wrote it- and it’s something i can relate to in my own ways. i commend the bravery, honesty, and respect that he shows himself in what he needs to do in order to feel okay (deleting his ig, posting his feelings, etc). and for ariana- i’m extremely disappointed in her actions. i’m aware that i’m just an outsider to this entire situation and of course, not completely informed of all the details, but the authenticity of pete’s cry for help cannot be ignored and it’s transparent that he is truly in pieces. he is trying to help himself by setting clear boundaries with ariana by directly telling her she is not healthy for his life. but upon hearing about his post, she shows up uninvited anyways, serving as a sadistic reminder of his pain, all while simultaneously tweeting about her new song’s release and cracking an ill-mannered joke: perverting care and concern into persistent, twisted darkness by fueling the fire of media frenzy, like throwing bloody meat into a shark tank. did she really think her actions were truly going to help him?ariana- i understand that writing songs is your own way of coping with life, however, i found your response to pete’s message extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate, and completely lacking in class. if you truly care for pete in the way you claim, please try to be more mindful of your public impact by listening to his request for relief by respecting his boundaries. so pete, if you read this somehow, please know that i am praying for your healing and peace. it’s wildly unfair and disgusting that your suffering is under the pop culture microscope for the sake of others’ entertainment and amusement. you may be a comedian but your feelings don’t deserve to be violated in this way. pete- your life is precious. you make others smile and laugh and forget their own worries. you take shitty circumstances and cleverly craft them into something that brings hope back into this ever-darkening world. also, you have made impactful strides in the likes of mental health advocacy- a realm i am personally passionate about- and i’m so proud of you. please know that you are seen and supported. you are heard. not heard for a script or press release or publicity statement but heard as a humble human being who needs some light during this overwhelming darkness that can be so invasive. your spirit is brave and worthy of happiness. i sincerely hope you find that happiness. you truly deserve comfort, peace, and healing. 
2 years ago i was in the darkest place possible and i thought the whole purpose of my life was to kill myself in my twenties. i've had a thought i want to talk to someone in a similar situation
i have a lot of theory and experience on anxiety and depression.i've had 3 suicide attempts.
need a friend
i’ve seen this sub for quite some time, but never posted before. i’ve been feeling very down lately. i feel worthless and unmotivated. i’m starting to hate my self, i fell like i’m a burden to the people i love. i’m feeling hopeless and alone. i used to have few close friends, but had become distant. and the friend i was closest to has stop talking to me. i feel alone and in need to talk to someone. to talk on how i feel and to take my mind off my problems. thank for reading 
i'm depressed and feel like a bag of crap. i've delt with depression before so i know ways to help cheer me up but i feel like so many bad things have happened that i can't get ahead of it. seems like i'm falling deeper and deeper into a black hole. the shitter i feel the more i feel i'm doing less.

quote i like

am i only one in the world who has no friends irl.
 i hate it when i see other people with their so-called bff and when i see people on social media showing off their adventures and support for each other while i'm sitting here alone in my own darkness and thinking during my terrible time in high school and was close to becoming the next columbine shooter to get rid of the popular kids now called normies by today's standards and i wish hollywood would stop making teen sitcoms because they are riddled with friendships when in reality most people including myself don't have any friends at all and they try to make us look bad and i wish that i had real true friends but unfortunately that's not going to happen anytime soon.
i asked out a friend and now i'm depressed and anxious. i don't know what to do.
i asked out my friend who i've had feelings for (and still do, mind you) and she said she'd date me. before i asked her out (days before), i had been getting incredibly nervous, and i was feeling anxious, and i didn't even know how i was feeling. i figured it was just nerves, but it kept up afterwards. i don't know why, but after she said yes, i cried for an hour. i didn't have a date in mind, at that point it was eating me up inside and i just had to ask, so it's been a week and i've still barely kept in contact. i've just been feeling more depressed than i ever have, and i've never felt anxiety, but now it's constant and acute. i was planning on a date that week, but instead i went home to get a fluoxetine prescription from my doctor, with advice to see a counselor on my college campus. it's been 6 days and i don't know what to do. i constantly feel sad, numb, and scared. it hurts, it really does. it's been emotional pain in my head constantly for a week and a half. i still want to date her, everything has gone so well and i've never clicked with someone like i have with her, but i feel so depressed that being around her doesn't cheer me up, it just makes me feel guilty for being depressed around her instead of making her happy, like i usually make every effort to. my friends are all downstairs playing games together, and they're probably wondering why i'm not with them (i told them i'll be there soon, before scampering upstairs to hide under my covers), and why i've been so withdrawn. i don't know what to tell my friends, and i don't know what to tell her. i don't know whether to tell them all that i've been depressed, so that they don't think that i just don't want to prioritize spending time with them, or whether i should just tell her, or whether i shouldn't tell anyone. me and her are both 18 and have never been in a relationship or dated anyone before. normally i'd say wait and see, but having asked her out, the clock is ticking. i'm just in pain and i don't know what to do to make it stop. in the past, i've been able to think my way out of my depression, but now i can't. before, my anxiety was always based on having something to worry about, but now it's constant and has no cause. i know i'm a smart, attractive, funny guy who's got a lot going for me, and yet everything i've mentioned before this sentence is also true.&#x200b;should i tell her that we can date, just later?should i tell her that we should go back to being friends?should i tell her we can be friends until i'm ready to date her?should i just tell her that i've been feeling really depressed recently, and that's why i haven't made plans? i know i need *some* explanation.should i tell my friends what's going on? i don't know if they really care too much, and i bet they're poorly equipped to help. i don't even know what i need, much less, them.should i just tell my friends i can't make it tonight?&#x200b;i know this is kind of asking for relationship advice, it's a bit of both, i know. i'm more asking for support, as i'm just hurting, confused, and kind of scared. my friends (particularly her) are the most important thing to me, and i don't want them to think less of me.
no appetite
i’ve been struggling with eating for months now and nothing’s getting any better, i’m at a loss and don’t know what to do at this point. i never feel the need to eat, i don’t feel hungry, i only know i’m getting hungry once my head starts hurting and i’m already underweight. has anyone gone through this?? what has helped? i’m desperate.
long hair tricks i’ve learned
hey alli asked this question a while ago and never got answers (so i deleted it) but after a while, i’ve found things that work for long hair and depression. tips below this ramble marked with ***for context, i am currently a hermit with sibling as my only direct contact, so i don’t brush my hair a lot. i don’t have the energy for it. my hair is at my tailbone, and a little bit thick with thinner hair on top a little. it tangled easily due to having no layers. i haven’t cut it in 5 years. i also have rmd, so i move a lot in my sleep if i’m stressed and get a rats nest on my hair. solution? *** during the night and for a few days, i’ll leave this hairstyle on. i do two braids, one on each side and then gather them together at the back in a ponytail. the braids i do are ones that gather the hair with each new strand, starting at the top of the head. this makes it so you have a braid going down the side of your head and will give you a thinner braid.this helps prevent bad knots and makes brushing the next day easier. i have left this hairstyle for a few days during major depressive dissociative episodes and i come out not bad, not having terrible utterly painful birds nests to de tangle after all that. it also helps when not showering as it hides yucky hair :(***during the day, literally all i do if i’m not doing the braids, is i use a plastic kids sized butterfly chopstick to hold my hair up. i like it a lot because there’s no elastic, and it’s easier to put up than a bun because of my hair. somehow it is easier. the video i looked up was like “no elastic updo long hair” on youtube, the channel was korean!directions to do this: on any part of the skull, gather the hair together like a ponytail and slightly (or tightly) curl all of it, and then twist it into a bun. twist! take the chopstick or pencil or any stick thing and poke it in the middle and centre part of the side of bun. make sure to push the stick so the point hits your skull a little - going straight. still touching the skull, then push the stick to the side and out the rest of the hair. the stick should be on the side, and it should feel secure. you can adjust it a little. it works because it’s so quick and you can take it down so so easily. so if i’m depressed suddenly and lie down and my hair is in the way because it was up, i can just take the stick out! easy to put back up really quickly. i’m so thankful i learned it. it’s made life easier lately.i hope this helps someone.oh and always - with long hair, always brush bottom to top! lay it against yourself and go slow if you have to. leave conditioner in as long as you can lol
my government won't support my parents any longer for having me
disclaimers: never posted on reddit before, but i don't know who else to talk to.   the grammar will be off because i am quite upset as i type this, my apologies.   quick backstory: i've suffered from depression ever since i was around 16, now i'm soon-to-be 25. i tried seeing a therapist back when i was 18 and started university. she was truly awful and i thought i had no right to see a therapist. fast forward to january 2019, i decided to try another therapist because i am truly incapable of living in this state. i still haven't finished university. i'm trying but failing. i'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. although i have a job i don't get paid much. i depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because i'm too old to count as a child. i just found out and i feel aweful. i never wanted to be a burden to my parents. they're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, i know she's growing impatient. she's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder.   i struggle very hard not to let the thought of ending it all so they'll be better of take over. because i know my mom won't be better of knowing i've commited suicide. i don't want to die. i just can't live.  does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?  i should talk to my therapist about this, i know. but my next session won't be for another 2 weeks.
thanks!!
i’m new on here and i just want you all to know how thankful i am for this site! i felt so alone like things were only happening to me ! i no i’m not alone anymore
suicide research study
hello,&#x200b;we are currently looking for people to take part in our research study exploring potential protective factors against suicide. you do not have to experience thoughts to take part, as we are interested in the protective factors too.&#x200b;anyone over 16 years of age and fluent in english can take part. if you decide to participate we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every month for the next two months. the questionnaire should only take around 20-25 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need.some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm. if there is a chance that this could be upsetting, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. if you would like to take part, please click the link below. this will take you to the survey and study information page.&#x200b;link: [https://chester.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/finding-protective-factors-against-suicide-1](https://chester.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/finding-protective-factors-against-suicide-1)&#x200b;thank you,&#x200b;rosie
how can suicide thoughts be so invasive? i have absolute zero control over them.
this anguish is making me insane, i'm on the verge of a crisis.
trying to have energy
i'm on two different meds for my clinical depression but i still only have a small amount of energy that i have to use up at work making sure i am as normal appearing as possible, so when i get home i have no energy left to cook or clean or do anyting really except maybe minimum requiring things. like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like dry cereal or a pop-tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure i have underwear and everything for work the next day.so what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend i spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure i keep a job. i have sleep apnea and a cpap that i wear every night but i'd still don't get the best sleep. i have some mobility issues due to injury from the army and also being overweight. i'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert.  so i'm wondering tips on how to get more energy despite my depression so that maybe i can get at least a little more done so that my weekends could be more than just using up that energy to make up for what doesn't get done during the week due to my lack of energy.
overwhelmed, clutching at straws and losing control of my life...
i don't know why i am even typing this, but i am.  i can't say how i feel because i feel more numb than anything, but this is my status:&#x200b;i have become so overwhelmed this fortnight, and my head is a hurricane of thoughts that i can't pinpoint so cannot focus on anything.&#x200b;everything is  a struggle and i am behind in work, house chores, personal hygiene and spending time with my fiance.&#x200b;knowing i am behind is just causing the pressure on my shoulders to increase and is shutting me down even more.&#x200b;i have no purpose, i don't enjoy my work, my life rotates around trying to pay for the house and bills each month.  my only goal in my life has been to have kids, but i am 31 this year and overweight and it's just not happening.  i feel like i have no right to be a mother when i get like this and it makes me so anxious that i will never be a fit a parent.  &#x200b;i have been with my fiance for 11 years but i feel like i am causing problems because i just can't do things that i should be able to - he has to do all the chores, the cooking and nag me to do basic things like clean my teeth which is so embarrassing for me.&#x200b;i don't want to go back on anti-depressants because we are trying for a baby, and i feel to embarrassed to go back to my therapist because i have lost my fight, and depression has knocked me down again.&#x200b;i am self-employed and losing the will to do the work which means i don't get paid which adds to the stress of paying for the bills etc.&#x200b;...i know i am the only person to sort myself out. i know i can't get an instant cure for this, and i know what the practical and realistic answer is to my next question but i will ask it anyway because it is on my mind and i don't have anyone else to ask it towards...&#x200b;have you ever had the strength to just up sticks and start fresh somewhere new to give your head a new start?  i'm not talking about leaving my partner, but more my house and work to move somewhere new.&#x200b;...it wont matter though, will it?  because depression is inside you, not around you and until you figure it out yourself you will never escape.&#x200b;i really hate having depression.
does anyone know of a depression help line or a depression chatroom?
i would like a helpline that allows you to text instead of call..
people acting like they feel bad for me is making my depression worse.
so about 6 months ago something happened that sent me into the worst depression of my life. i already get depression sometimes, but up until a few months or less ago i was ready to kill myself.i ended up moving back in with my parents (did not want to, i didn’t grow up in a healthy household and it’s still not healthy) and quitting my job (about 4 months ago).i’m currently picking myself back up. i’m at the point that i know when i get a new job i will for the most part be back to normal. whenever i talk to my mom about putting out applications and what i’m doing, she just gives me this sad looking smile. i know that my mom/parents are not healthy...honestly i need to move out of here when i can (there are a lot of reasons that i won’t go into right now). but i guess in my state of mind this really bothers me. i’m trying to get back on my feet and instead of someone there to say “you can do this!” i get this pity look. i don’t understand. it makes me go back into that thinking pattern of “what’s the point?”.i don’t need praise in normal life, but with what i’ve been through/am going through it would be nice to have some positive support.i don’t really have anyone else besides my parents right now and one friend that i see occasionally. (another thing i plan to start working on, making more friends). any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this within myself? (i’m not interested in trying to change someone else). 
if you need to talk, i can talk

none of my friends remembered my birthday.
so a bit of background: i am 23 years old and recently i quit a well paying job because i was unhappy with the job profile and i also needed to focus on my further education. i have been a lot studying for university entrance exams and hence a lot of the time i am at home alone which leaves me feeling really lonely and depressed. i am the kind of person who has a very hard time making friends and most of my friends are busy working jobs in other cities or studying in some other city. hence lately my interaction with my friends has reduced a lot. i often see that they have made new friends at their new job/university and i whenever i see their fb/insta posts and statuses, i feel really down as it feels like they have moved on with their life. also since i recently quit my job, i have been living on my savings for a while and this makes it really difficult for me to go out and meet new friends on the weekends, which again adds to the frustration. a lot of people might suggest uninstalling social media but i am reluctant to do so because i am afraid i might lose touch with my existing friends.i make it a point to remember the birthdays and anniversaries of all people close to me and i make it a point to wish them on their special day. i also go through all the trouble of mailing them a greeting card or a small gift. last week was my birthday and none of my friends, barring one, remembered. this really hurt and i am having trouble dealing with it. all i expected from my friends was a simple text wishing me, but nobody really remembered. when did remind everyone, they did apologize and i do understand that due to their busy schedules they might have forgotten my birthday. a few days later i see some of my friends posting photos on social media wishing their new friends on their birthday and this made me feel even worse. it made me feel as if my friends don't value me anymore . this is really bothering me and i am now realizing that i am spending too much time thinking about it. i do want to move on and forgive my friends but the thought constantly keeps bothering me. it's just that i whenever any of my friends has trouble or needs someone to talk to i make myself available and try to make them feel cheerful and it really hurts to see that they don't even bother to remember my birthday.i would really love any advice on how to get past this and deal with this.
super proud
i’m really proud of myself right now (and kind of surprised)today has been one of many, many days where i  wake up and i can feel that grey mist around my head. it takes away my motivation, my energy, my ability to connect with people. i only realised what it was 18 months ago but i now know that it’s been hanging around for almost 8 years (wanker!).i took my meds, tried to get on with my day but could feel myself sinking as the afternoon wore on. then, as the evening drew in and i stepped into my room, i looked around and saw the pit that i’ve let it become. the dirty clothes, the piles of half-sorted items, the dust. this often triggers me to feel even worse, like a failure (‘what kind of adult can’t even perform basic tasks like putting laundry in the laundry basket?! why are you living in filth?! you are so pathetic’ etc)usually, this would then push me to such a low point that i would just push all my stuff off the bed, curl up and sleep. not shower, not attempt to tidy, just hide away in my hole of despair.but tonight, i was fed up and could feel myself heading in that direction. and some small voice in my brain said ‘nope!’ and i chucked on some sports clothes and went for an hour long walk, by myself. it felt bloody brilliant. so, pat on the back for me today. i hope you’re all doing ok. we are all stronger than we think.update - i came home from work today and tidied my room a little. the laundry is done and you can actually see some of the floor. it’s not perfect but it’s something! funny how such a small thing can make a difference.
sleeping my life away
does anyone else sleep too much? i constantly have things i need to do (homework, cleaning, engaging with friends, etc) but i always choose to “nap” instead. sometimes i don’t even sleep, i just lie in bed (lay in bed?) doing absolutely nothing. no matter how much i sleep, i’m still physically and emotionally exhausted. i’ve had the same career goal since i was a little kid, but i never make sincere efforts to achieve it, partly because i don’t think i expected to still be here.how do i get out of bed when i feel like this? how can i start doing what i have to when all i want to do is sleep? (background: i’m 25, was on effexor for 11 years, now i’m taking wellbutrin and trintellix, so please no medication shaming. tia)
thoughts?

yesterday was my birthday. i had a great morning then after lunch i got hit with a major depressive episode
me, my mom, and my brother went ziplining for my birthday. it was absolutely great and i loved every second of it. i was doing okay and i wasn’t having any panic attacks or thinking about jumping off a platform and killing myself or anything and when we left i was in a pretty decent mood too. but then around 1ish we got lunch and i got hit with a depressive episode and i kinda turned into a dick and slept all the way home and as soon as we got home i got in bed. it was 3:00. slept till 7 and everyone came over to talk to me and try to tell me happy birthday and eat cake and stuff and i couldn’t even get out of bed. i hurt my cousins feelings and yelled at my grandparents and uncle and wouldnt even talk to my dad. all while i was sitting in my bed in the dark opening stuff then sitting it on my nightstand and rolling back over and then i went back to bed and didn’t wake back up until 4 this morning. then when my mom came in my room this morning and kept trying to ask me what was wrong and what happened i wouldn’t tell her and she got mad and now she’s threatening to take me to the hospital and i’m thinking maybe i should just let her cause i can’t do this much longer.
who am i
i lost myself to depression. i don’t have a personality anymore, i’m not myself and i’ll never be able to find myself in the dark. i can’t remember who i was before depression destroyed me. fuck.
i used to be okay
i used to consider myself okay. i have been struggling with depression for several years now. found a medication that worked, a healthy and stable relationship, and moved away from my troubling family.suddenly i found myself considering suicide. genuinely, considering my options, time frames, etc. i've never fallen so hard before to the point where the police showed up at my door to see if i was still alive. i struggle with depression, anxiety, ocd. i have never struggled so hard before and yet felt like i wasn't struggling at all before, because when i really decided that i might just kill myself it was such a relief. this was just a couple days ago. i have since switched medication and am desperately trying to feel okay again.i just want to be okay

how to help my husband not feel like he’s useless against my depression
i’ve been depressed for a long time now. i’ve been struggling for as long as he’s known me and it hasn’t gotten any better throughout the course of our time together. recently, he’s been feeling like he’s useless and can’t do anything to help me when i’m feeling really down and he’s getting really frustrated. needless to say this puts a strain on our relationship and how we communicate with each other. i don’t know how to help him help me. i’ve told him i just need him to be supportive and compassionate and loving but it frustrates him when he does that and i’m still depressed. i think he understands that my mental health can’t be fixed in a day but i hate that i make him feel like this. has anyone been through something similar? how did you get through/manage it?
only you are responsible for you.

depressed piece of shit
i am a young adult who lives in new york- i grew up with fully supporting parents and friends, but that means nothing when your mental health is not stable. the last year of my life i have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. at this point, i feel so incurable- nothing has helped. i have seen my therapist for a year, see professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. things have gotten worse than before. i have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point i just pull out any clean clothes i can find in my dresser. showers? ha- even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. and i am so sick and tired of hearing the same bullshit lines of it will get better, and you have nothing to be depressed about, or everything will be fine because it always works out.to be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. i can't look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself- internally, externally and mentally. i hate myself- and the people i am hurting. i could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head. sometimes i sit and regret not just doing it- blade to my wrist and a family member walks in. i had the blade in my right hand, resting on my left forearm- and i regret not ending my life there when i had the motherfucken chance.
apathy
i don't want to work and i don't understand which kind of job could be good for me. i know it sounds incredibly lazy and privileged, but i do make an effort. i commute to work 2 hours 6 days a week, sometimes i have to wake up at 5:30, i teach english to kids and adults, i plan lessons consistently most of the time and try to do my best. i'm not fantastic, but acceptable and sometimes good. but every time i think about going to work i cringe. i just want to stay in bed and read or watch films all day and do nothing at all all my life. i feel like a complete failure and don't know what to do with my life. sometimes i cry two days in a row and i often eat to reduce stress and it makes me hate myself even more. i can't do anything else and i don't know what to do with my life.
created a website for help.
i just created a website called [therapythesoul.com](https://powerful-wave-51463.herokuapp.com/) and it's a place where people can send their personal issues they're having to me and i give advice. personally, i've struggled with clinical codependency and serious drug induced psychosis due to mixing ssri's w/ psychedelics. just to give you more of a background of what inspired me to do this. i can't provide all the answers but i definitely have the desire to help people. there is also a donation page. thats for folks who feel generous. im not doing this for money i just have it there because why not?&#x200b;there is no signup. just put your name or a fake name, your email or one you just are temporarily using, and your actual issue. i really want to provide some insight to your situation. maybe i can help.&#x200b;ps - i eventually wanna have more links/resources for the page itself. i'll add that when i get some more free time.
hey i was wondering if there is anyone i can talk to. can’t sleep and i have depression and anxiety to thank.
i just need to talk; maybe get some stuff off my chest. edit: thank you all for your support! i was able to connect with someone who helped me on so many levels. he was able to give me advice and helped rationalize my way of thinking. he was able to uplift my spirits and now i have a better outlook on my life. sometimes just saying what’s on your mind can alleviate the weight on your chest. to others who may be in the position i was in, don’t be afraid to reach out. you’d be surprised at how amazing human beings can truly be! so thank you again, everyone!
going on anti depressants
hi there, i'm going on sertraline for the first time, anyone have any experiences?
i feel the pull to rot again please how do i get rid of this
 i have had a two month upswing feeling good improving myself  and feeling like i can improve the lives of  others but today i can feel the pull again to  lay down and rot please help  &#x200b; 
how to human?
how to life?how to alive?
i feel lifeless
i feel so physically and mentally drained. my depression has been so bad that i don't know what to do about it. i've been an absolutely weepy mess, and don't feel as if i have the energy to do anything. i don't really like talking about my depression to begin with and feel like a burden if i do. even when i try to talk to my family about it, they don't understand. i just feel so alone and suicidal anymore.  
is it normal to feel sad for yourself going through depression? like as you would have heartache for a child going through a tough time?
i just get re-sad about myself being sad; “you poor thing!”
i don't know what's happening to me
doesn't matter what i do i don't see the point in anything. i can't be happy i can't be content. i have no friends no way of making friends i'm so lonely it hurts but i can't fix it. it's impossible for me to connect with anyone. i'm so uncomfortable and awkward i feel like i shouldn't exist. nothing fixes it nothing fixes it and i am so done i keep seeing myself ending my life in my mind's eye and i can't stop it. i'm bipolar and ocd and i don't know why i am this way. my family doesn't understtand i can't explain it. i'm going to see m y therapist tomorrow but i'm too afraid to tell him what i'm thinking about because i don't want to be locked up. i feel like i'm losing my mind and i just want to not exist. i can't even take care of myself can't remember the last ime i washed my hair wearing the same clothes over and over again. i just want to lay in bed i'm so tired i don't want to talk i don't want to watch tv i don't want to do anything please help me.
my mom sent this song to me earlier this evening - tears ensued and reminded me how thankful i am to have her

not really excited to live
throwaway. was listening to a podcast that made me cry, so i figured i'd talk about it.  i've kinda lost my excitement for life. don't really feel strongly about anything. lost my mom  at 16, rendering my dad homeless. (was too injured to work, not enough for comp). when we split, went to live w/ my grandma.(who died after i moved out) my dad died last year after my 25th birthday. all i ever wanted to do was make my parents proud. i did that and they're gone now. we had a great relationship, and i called my dad near daily. it's kind of fucked up that when the call came, i'd been waiting for many years for it. homeless people are always at risk, and i worried about him. kind of glad i don't worry anymore, and i still talk to him in my dreams.  now i'm 26, 8 years married(6 were dating), handsome white guy living in his dream country.  chronically unemployed, not legally allowed to work (dependent visa). every month, we spend down to zero. every day feels like a reset to zero. like nothing i do adds up. can't save. can't build muscle, and my local language learning is slow. i'm a house husband at this point, cooking, cleaning, making art. i just don't feel like anything i do is meaningful. it always feels like a reset to zero. i feel like i'm just passing the days. &#x200b;i'm social and funny, so despite being shy, i never have a hard time making new friends. transitioning new friends into lasting friends pretty much never happens though. back to 0 after a few weeks, every time.  idk, i feel dumb. i have no idea what i want by posting here. post on reddit, pat myself on the back, then back to zero, i guess.
want someone to talk to? enjoy the power of the anonymous internet, i've been suffering (and still am) from depression, and know both how important it is to speak your mind and how hard it is to do so with someone without self-judgement. just pm me, and i'll talk to you about anything.
i won't be immediately available, but just shoot me a pm (or even message here) and i'll get around to anyone (if anyone) who asks!

how to cope with depression tales of mere existence

my favorite quote

i got fucking fired today
so today i was let go from my crappy serving job. my partner and i both work at the same restaurant. she’s been working there for about six months, i’ve been there less than three. two months ago the 20 year old restaurant that i work at was bought by a new owner. about three weeks ago he told us that the restaurant would be closing for two and a half weeks due to renovations, he’s changing the name, the menu, painting. he said that we should take this as a break, go visit family, and generally rest up for the opening of his new restaurant. i invited my father to come stay with us for the week, he flew in from texas for the thanksgiving holiday. so yesterday he sends my partner and i a group text asking for us to come in to discuss the schedule moving forward. i’m not worried about this at all but my partner suffers from anxiety and had a bad feeling. wanting to solve this issue i texted him saying “hey johnny, chelsea is having some anxiety about the meeting tomorrow. i wanted to text you so you could put her nerves at ease, she thinks were being fired. i just wanted to tell her this isn’t the case and there’s no reason to worry”to my surprise he replies and says “this is a completely inappropriate way to deal with your employed”so at this point i realize what’s happening, it’s pretty fucking weak. i’ve been bending over backwards for this guy trying to help get him up to speed on everything. i’m was astonished that he said that to me.so we both assume we’re being fired at this point but stop texting him. he asks us to come in around 10:30 blah blah blah. we go to bed and get up the next day, we go in to meet with him. he asks if we want to sit down, he won’t make any eye contact with either one of us. staring at the floor he says “sacha i am terminating you, chelsea if you want to stay and work two shifts a week you can” i asked him why and he said “just personality differences” which is total bullshit since just two days earlier he was talking about how he needed to make cuts to payroll. this piece of shit fires me and cuts my partners hours in half. practically negging her to quit since she has been there for six months and qualifies for unemployment. (if he let her go she qualifies but if she quits she doesn’t) edit: later find out he fired multiple people. he hands me a check for 47.50 since we hadn’t been working and my partner and i leave. i told her to keep working until she’s able to find another job, we can’t afford for something like this to happen. we’re fucked. christmas is coming, my utilities are due. (fortunately i had about 750 saved so i can pay my rent tomorrow) i am so bummed out, i don’t want to work for a shitty human like that but i just don’t get it. how can someone be so cruel? some people are just cruel i guess? thanks for listening.

depression or living a wrong life?

have trouble eating
the last several months have been quite rough on me, and i've had trouble eating enough. i've just lost the urge to eat, and when i do, i end up feeling full and nauseous after a very small portion.do any of you have any tips on how to deal with this?
i'm a burden...
i feel like such a burden to my friends. i know they love and support me and they tell me that i'm not, but i just cant help but feel like i am. i really, really need to talk to them abt some metal health stuff, but i just feel like i'm just a hassle and i'm just the expendable one. get through this school year and then i'll never talk to them again. idk what to do. i really need to talk to someone.
dumb mental trick for daydreamers
this is going to sound crazy, but fuck it. i have an overactive imagination...so to help deal with the powerlessness and loneliness of random depression, i like to imagine that somewhere on this earth i have a “depression counterpart.” my depression counterpart is a completely different person than me, i don’t know anything about them. but unfortunately, our emotions are linked: when their life sucks, i randomly get depression, and when my life sucks, they randomly get depression.  if my depression starts acting up, i think to myself, “goddamnit, depression counterpart! you didn’t keep your shit together!”but then i remember that they’re also having a bad time. in fact, they’re feeling just as terrible as i am. plus, i feel guilty about all the times i randomly made their life hell. then i realize i should try to keep things together.  to make life better for both of us. because we’re in it for life together? i’m not sure, maybe we just get reassigned a new depression counterpart if one of us dies. anyways, happiness can be just as infectious and self-feeding as depression.
a wish. a prayer. a truth.
i dont want to be the person i am now. i want some perspective instead of this fog that i have made out of everything. i want to breathe free. i want to be able to believe in myself. i want to smile a genuine smile and say that i am proud of myself. i want to   stop feeling like i am drowning with every breath i take. i want to feel real. i want to be real. i want to feel life. i want to be able to really touch, smell and see. how do i start? how do i keep up? how do i finally cut away all these invisible ropes that keep wrapping around me, swallowing me whole. 
someone dear to me told me this and when i’m at my lows i remind myself of it...
those moments you are happy, they are inside of you. just like the sadness is. the sadness tends to take hold stronger, but that happiness is still there behind the sadness. it’s there waiting for you to grab it. it will always be there because it’s you.  you may not always feel happiness but that doesn’t mean it’s gone. it’s you. you are sadness. but most importantly you are happiness. never forget those moments you are alone and you see something beautiful and it kindles something in your heart that makes you smile, that’s you. that simple thought of beauty, kindness, laughter, love, it’s always inside of you even when you don’t see it at the moment.and if all else fails, running away is better than taking your life.  i saw this in a post not to long ago and i can’t quite remember the wording but the thought stuck. if things are so awful in the situation you are in now, run away. begin. i know there could be financial problems that can make it seem hard but just try. just run. run away with your life. it’s the only thing you have. 
why are people important?
is it normal to feel like people don't matter at all, even if its ur family or friends? have you ever feel like you're a stranger to the world? have you ever feel like you shouldn't matter too?

depression physically rewires your brain. any treatments to re-rewire your brain?
tl;drdepression physically rewires your brain over time. this might be the case for many of us who have been chronically and severely depressed for many many years.it only gets progressively harder to fight depression with a brain that becomes more partial to depression everyday.any treatment recommendations that focus on rewiring the brain and not just treating chemical imbalances?\----------------------:: full version ::i've been aware of this for some time, but only in the aspect of improvement. practice makes perfect.in psychology, we learned the example of the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is responsible for spatial memory, of taxi drivers and the observed physical changes over time as drivers improved in their ability to memorize maps of the city they were driving in everyday. another example was the changes in the brains of medical students during the span of their education, which enforced memorizing large quantities of information regarding the human anatomy, biology, and chemistry.**negative thoughts, the resulting anxiety, and overall depressive behaviors that persist in someone who is chronically depressed also rewires the brain and conditions it to be even more and more perfectly depressed.****what little hope, motivation, and optimism we have is dwindling every day that we are depressed, and yet, this is our equipment to fight a stronger, more invigorated depressed brain.****we are using a brain that becomes more and more partial to being depressed everyday... to fight depression. how paradoxical is that?**i think this is the case for me and many of you all.i know of medication and therapy (eg cbt) to be two common treatment methods, but...cbt requires huge effort on part of the patient to actively and methodically develop healthier thinking. persistence and motivation is required from someone whose primary symptoms are a lack of those qualities. it's an arduous process depending on the severity of depression. and medication, while effective (if you can find the right one), treats chemical imbalances. do you know of any treatments that target rewiring the brain? have you tried any, and how have they worked for you?
how do you deal with hygiene when you have depression? (showers, washing face, brushing teeth, changing clothes etc)

the constant feeling of being alone while surrounded by everyone
i, no matter who i am around, no matter who i am speaking to, unless they are majority like me or infatuated with me feel alone. i don't think that's healthy but there isn't much to combat my autosexuality and misunderstanding as to why others don't have the same values as me.i have of course talked with the few friends i have about this and the points they brought up were that i expect too much of others, speak out against disrespect too much (what?), and don't enjoy the things everyone else likes.i have minimal friends, or at least only one that actually makes an effort to make me a part of their life, as i do for most everyone else, friend or not. i donate to charity and spend most of my money on my friends, or did until i didn't have any left and they started to disappear. (side note they didn't leave me because i didn't have money, it just came to notice that i was the only one of our friends spending money on each other, the rest either just spent their money on weed or indulging themselves, not even saving :/ which put me out in a number of ways due to plans we had but that's another story.) i tend to try to speak about my emotions with my friends but it never works out because they never seem to care but i'm always there to listen even when they don't want to talk. i expect all of these things out of my friends because the good friends i had online when i was a kiddo were like that but the people i find online are just like the people i meet in real life. this has lead me to outcast and be outcast by nearly everyone besides a few that unlike the other friends actually truly understand the value of my advice and conversation as well as understanding that i would go out of my way to be kind to another individual, which nobody i've met besides one other person (save for online) is like and i don't know why. i'm trying to find better friends but the ones that i find that are kind tend to be boring and judgmental in different but equally unsatisfying ways.for instance i'm a huge nerd and geek who likes to get into philosophical discussions but also enjoy things such as weed and psychedelics. maybe it's just my area but i only ever find one or the other, not both. while yes the stoners to talk philosophy sometimes, the details fly over their heads and the complex computer games i've been playing since i was a child tend to push them away, i think.the biggest difference between the friends i know and myself would be tastes in music and approaches to situations. for instance, i can't enter a smoke session with any of my friends, good or bad, without hearing rap. i enjoy rap and all the sub=genres of it but am i wrong for not enjoying hearing the same songs in the same genre every time we hang out? all of which talk about sex or drugs or defaming explicit content? like i'm not being stereotypical here that's genuinely what the songs they listen to are lmao. while all great in their own rights, its not all i want to hear, every day. i'm a fan of bands like radiohead, interpol, lo-fi, meme music, techno or chillwave.now when i say approaches to situations, every time they have an issue i give advice, now my advice is 90% of the time the correct path, which, 90% of the time is never taken. i never give an, i told you so. as that is rude, but even though time and time again, my advice proves true, it's never taken. another example of this is the fact that, i go for personality over looks, which doesn't make sense to my friends. like i have been in more relationships than they have and know for a fact that no matter how attractive a person may look, means nothing for what kind of person they are.a lot of what it feels like to me is being trapped between a world of toxic masculinity and whatever you'd call the complete opposite of that. online friends would be nice but it's hard to keep them as majority of the online friends i'd like to have, play moba's like league of legends or mmo's. those are the kind of people i want to be friends with but i can never find enjoyment in time wasters like mmo's or games that require odd skill and patience such as moba's. it's hard for me to meet super nerds who play fps games regularly that also play like, say, minecraft and rocket league too. not saying they don't exist but i don't find many.  it's hard to find them online for me and especially in real life. i don't enjoy technology. i love my computer to death but i would much rather go outside and larp for instance (which i don't even do (although would low-key love to)) than use my phone, at all. one of the biggest issues with this is when i literally just go without a phone for months. i don't enjoy talking on the phone (no matter how amazing i sound on it) i would much rather talk over the computer due to the call not being the only the my attention must be focused on while using the device. but this is even more of an issue when applying for jobs and each application has the required asterisk for home phone number while i don't have a mobile or home phone :/ okay despite that rant the advice i'm asking is that like, should i change myself, am i really the one on the wrong for trying to do what i feel is right and feel that others should think is right, and i don't mean all the personal opinions like games, music, etc. i mean should i change my values, like the willingness to trust anyone, unbridled criticism and kindness, giving money to people without thinking about the financial ramifications on myself (i have tweaked that a bit, but if someone betrays that trust i just cut them out like come on b.) like i remember having an argument where my friend told me that being rude was normal and i looked at him and said, why would i ever want to be normal, especially if normal is rude? he proceeded to just kinda make a noise at me, which he tended to do when he didn't want, or could not come up with a response. another friend, who i thought and still kinda is my best friend, i posted a picture of myself to my story on snap making a silly face, which was posted after a rather attractive pic of me, to which he slid up with wtf and i was like, what bro? he was like, remember how you asked why you have no friends? to which i was like, yeah? he was like, this. i proceeded to probe like, what's wrong with being silly? i never get angry, never get sad, am almost always happy, genuinely, work harder than anybody i know, tend to make more money for that reason, make the people better around me, which shows, so why, what is wrong with being fun. my apologies that i don't want to sit around, smoke weed, look at snapchat stories, buy branded clothing, smoke weed again, and talk about 'bitches'. &#x200b;jeeez i ranted more than i expected to.
i want to die but wish it were an accident
i’ve always wanted to just die. since about 14 years of age, i’m currently 28 but never actually wanted to do it myself. i’ve been on a million different types of ssri’s but nothing has changed my mind and the therapists just send me to a new one when a medication won’t work and then i have to start over. the last month of my life has been really hard and i’m just so over trying to make it better, i want to wallow in my sadness except i have a marriage and 3 kids to keep. my mom has cancer, my dads in surgery right now for his gallbladder, i have thought about leaving my husband of ten years because he’s an alcoholic, i’m trying to homeschool my 6 year old but i’m too stupid to figure out common core math and we’re way behind, my mother in law threatened to take my children away because of my husbands drinking, i freaked out and lost the relationship with her, my fil, and my sister in law, i’ve gained 30 pounds, my son has fluid in his brain, there’s something wrong with my nose because it’s been almost completely plugged for 3 months, and my 2 year old just got pink eye. i’m going to therapy but my therapist ha been on vacation for the last two weeks so i haven’t seen him and my doctors don’t know what meds to give me so they have just kind of been ignoring me. i’m drowning in housework (which my mil pointed out)and i’m so overwhelmed. i don’t even know why i’m writing this on reddit. i don’t think there is anything anyone can do...
17 yo male
i've been depressed for 5 years now and i really need help. i've struggled with cutting and self worth and self image. i finally opened up to my parents but it honestly didn't make it any better. i want help but i don't feel comfortable talking about it with many people. i'm a christian but not a very mature one at that. my parents want me to read the bible and find helpful verses and seek comfort and peace in god. while i agree it works i don't know if i'm mature enough to do it. any advice would help.
i don't know how to process how i feel in a healthy way and i just don't know what to do any more
i'm using a throwaway account for the sake of privacy.  i apologize how i've structured my post, it's very much train of thoughtto make a very long story short, my now 2.5 year old daughter has been struggling with a brain tumor since 5 months. she's been doing well with chemo until recently when she required multiple brain surgeries to debulk the rapidly growing tumor. as a result she's been hospitalized for the past 3 months. she's suffered a lot of muscular atrophy, cognitive regression and as a result of the surgery, lost her vision.prior to this we all lived out of state with zero family support from a previous falling out. i had a serious injury that kept me off work for a year, then the baby came, then the cancer came. i finally became the sole breadwinner as my wife stayed home with my daughter to care for her. but it wasn't enough, we had to charge groceries to credit cards, not pay those cards, get deeper into debt, etc. my wife has been at the hospital with my daughter since she was hospitalized, i spent the first 3 weeks but had to return to work. we also around the same time she was hospitalized moved into a new house. i've been alone in the house for 3 months now with a weekly visit to the hospital as it's a couple hours away from my home.my wife is pregnant with our second child and is also quitting her job once again putting me into the role of sole breadwinner. we have family now where we live so the burden is much less, but the pressure is still very heavy on my shoulders. i've noticed recently that i've been coping in very unhealthy ways. i process by compartmentalizing how i feel to deal with it later. problem is, i've realized, is that i don't ever unpack it later. as the things i need to deal with grow in number and severity, i've found myself dealing in very harmful ways. i've gained about 25lbs in the past few months. i can't stop eating. and eating just garbage. frozen meals, chips, popsicles, ice cream, etc. dishes are piled up. i go out of my way to eat something that i don't have to use dishes for. trash is piled up around the house. i have no energy to do anything productive beyond go to work.often i come home and i'll immediately eat and binge on youtube, video games, anything that i can focus on 100%. i stay up til 2-4am, fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, but wake up and not want to leave bed until i absolutely have to.i just got a promotion to management which is great but it's a ton of extra stress on top of everything. i avoid spending time with people or leaving my house unless i need to. i know i'm just avoiding dealing with my issues.so i took a couple weeks off work and contacted a therapist. i spoke with her about everything i have going on and she gave me some very solid advice and asked me to take some time to write or talk about my feelings and actually feel things. she asked me to clean a room in the house so it can be a peaceful place of reflection.  this was friday morning.so saturday night here i sit, binging youtube videos eating bowl after bowl of cereal and chugging soda. i feel even worse now knowing what i should be doing. i didn't do anything all weekend. i sat in my house and continued to destroy my body and feel awful.i don't know how to begin working on my shit. i have had great advice and i acknowledge its good and that i have a problem but i just can't seem to do anything about it. it feels like i'm caught in some catch 22 cycle of self defeat and i feel really hopeless. i hate talking about my problems to other people, i feel like i'm bringing them down or bothering them.i just don't know what to do.
11 tips on how to get more motivated when depressed
i've had undiagnosed depression for the last several years. and it was absolute hell. it really messed up my social life and my gpa (which absolutely tanked my sophomore year). but, about a year ago, i got so sick of being in that situation that i decided to do something about it. it took me months to actually start doing it, but i started blogging about my experiences. *i've always had difficulty 'putting myself out there' and honestly i'm still terrified of it but oh well.*  something has got to change. it might as well be me.i skimmed through most of the posts on this reddit and i'm relieved that you guys have had the same problems i do (i hope that doesn't sound bad - i mean that it's nice to know that i'm not the only one who is struggling in life). &#x200b;**but, from my own experiences, some things that i've started doing that help with keeping myself motivated (and thus feeling better about myself by being more productive) are:**&#x200b;1)  **setting your standards low**: you can't expect yourself to clean your whole house in one day when you can barely get out of bed. what i suggest is to set your standards low - so low that you think that they're too easy. then the odds of you doing it will increase dramatically since you've already decided the task is so easy.&#x200b;2) **do your most important tasks first:** you only have so much energy in a day - sometimes none at all. use that precious energy to do what absolutely has to be done.&#x200b;3) **split up bigger tasks into smaller goals:** one thing that helps keep procrastination down and motivation up is breaking up bigger goals into smaller ones. like tip #1 mentioned, you can't build rome in a day when you can't build a house (sorry for the terrible analogy but i hope it made sense lol). in other words, take baby steps. &#x200b;4) **don't be too hard on yourself:** you're depressed. you're not at 100%. beating yourself up over something that went wrong or you couldn't do isn't going to help anyone, especially not you. &#x200b;5) **reward yourself and take breaks:** you're not a superhero - you needn't act like one. take breaks whenever you need to. even if you haven't done anything at all, if you need to take a break then take one. if you start doing too much and get stressed, you'll get a burnout. when you do something productive, reward yourself. watch some netflix or get a starbucks coffee or something. do something that makes your day better.&#x200b;6) **multitask:** this tip doesn't work for everyone, but if you're one of those people that gets bored of a task easily and zones out and don't want to do it anymore, then alternated between 2 tasks. switch to the other task when you get bored of one of them.&#x200b;7) **think about why you don't like doing something:** if you absolutely hate vacuuming - think about why. does the noise bother you? is it an unpleasant experience? if it's possible try and make sure you 'block' out the trigger. for example, if the vacuum's loud noise bothers you, wear headphones or earplugs. this also applies to anything in your life. if you're not happy with something in your life, then change it. you're the ceo of your life.&#x200b;8) **beat your perfectionism:** i struggled with perfectionism for a very long time and it hurt me in school. i couldn't turn in any homework unless it was absolutely perfect. of course, as a result, i ended up not turning in homework. this lowered my grade significantly and i also didn't know the test content because i didn't do the homework. double whammy. you need to change this mindset because a) nothing will ever be perfect and b) anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.&#x200b;9) **recharge and reenergize:** you can't work all day (and you shouldn't). make sure to get 8-10 hours of sleep. refer to tip #5.&#x200b;10) **positive outlook:** before you roll your eyes, hear me out. if you think you're going to fail, that's what your actions will do. you cannot expect failure and be victorious. &#x200b;11) **get help:**  if you’re really struggling with your procrastination (and/or depression), then you should make an appointment with a professional (such as a licensed therapist). while your friends and your significant other may be able to help you to a level, you can’t always rely on them for advice and their time. &#x200b;if you would like, you can get a more in-depth explanation of all of these tips [here](https://valentinabostick.com/mentalillnesses/depression/11-tips-on-how-to-get-more-motivated-when-depressed/) (the link is linked to an article that i wrote on my website. feel free to check it out, share it, comment, and all that stuff.)if not, that's perfectly fine. i really hope that this post helped in some way. i started writing because it was something i enjoyed and i also want to help people who struggle from depression and anxiety (both of which i have).##
not worth it...
to those who are contemplating suicide as a solution to their struggles:on march 28th i committed suicide. i say commited suicide vs. attempted suicide because i didn't attempt anything. i made the active decision to end my life and followed through with it. personally i am bi-polar with borderline personality disorder and ptsd. to say that i have struggled throughout my life is an understatement. before this i have no history of physical self-harm. i quantify my reference to self-harm as physical because a lot of my behaviors and actions in other areas could be viewed as a different form of self-harm.that day i was at work and had a terrible headache. i decided to go home for the day and tend to it. i have a history of missing work due to my instability and have even lost jobs over it. my very patient and loving husband was understandably frustrated with my leaving early again. we got into a bit of a spat and in a split second random decision i was going to kill myself. i enacted a plan, partially researched and partially from years of working in the pharmaceutical industry. i put together a cocktail of medications that would suppress my respiratory system until i finally stopped breathing. before taking this medications i took phenergan to make sure that i didn't throw up my cocktail. through text messages, calls, and facetime my husband realized that something was wrong. when he got home to me i was already aspirating and violently coughing. i had taken the medications 2 hours prior. he immediately called 911 and was told to secure the animals so that ems could quickly get to me. he heard the sirens outside but due to our apartment complex being very confusing he knew that they were struggling to find us. in what i'm sure was the most terrifying decision of his life he left me in bed and ran downstairs to lead the paramedics to our apartment. by the time i made it to the hospital, all of the medications has been processed in my body and there was no point in trying to pump my stomach. i was in the icu for 3 days, intubated and on the verge of death. luckily i pulled through and made a full recovery. had my husband been 5 or 10 minutes later getting home, i wouldn't be writing this post. i immediately went from the hospital to a treatment facility in tennessee called the ranch. i was there for 4 weeks and it was an incredibly life-changing experience. i highly recommend it to anyone with mental health or addiction issues. the ranch is widely considered to be one of the best treatment centers in the country.my point in sharing all of this is that i have seen first hand the effects that suicide has on your family and friends. it is a terrible decision that is selfish and uncaring. i will never forget the state that my family was in when i regained consciousness. it was devastating. to anyone who is considering suicide, please find another option. suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and it is not worth it.
please let me help you!!!
i want to help everyone get through whatever they're going through, so please, if something's going on or if you just need someone to talk to, i'll gladly try my best to help you get through it! (if i don't get back to you when you message me or comment or something i'm either asleep or in school, so don't be discouraged!)
depression is making me unable to perform what i can do
to whoever is reading this, sorry in advance for my poor english, i’m not a native speaker. i’m an international student who’s currently studying in the uk. i’m a first year architecture student and i’ve just come here for 6 months. i’ve had depression for around 2 years, but i haven’t really talked to a professional about this so i don’t know how serious it is. i personally feel like my depression has gotten worse after i came here, i barely have any friends and i spend 90% of the time in my room. i don’t go to lectures and find it hard to go to the studio and meet people. honestly, i wouldn’t say i’m a genius but i do think i’m quite smart. i did the ib and i got a 7 for hl maths, but, after i came here i could hardly make anything to a borderline pass. i’m having my final review for my current project now, everyone is like super prepared but i only have a crappy model with a super shitty report. i’m feeling really really bad and really want to go home and cry now. idk if it’s depression that’s making me unable to perform my best or if it’s just me who’s just basically useless. please tell me if anyone has gone through anything like this, and would it help if i go meet a psychiatrist or psychologist. 
depression isn’t a joke !!!!!!
depression isn’t a joke! why is it taken so lightly when someone else other than them self is depressed. “ oh awe” “ get over it” “ just go for a walk” “ feel better soon” “ focus on something else” “ don’t always be so sad”“oh well that’s life”“ i know it sucks” yah let’s avoid helping the depressed, let’s not help them deal with it rather just give them a bunch of things to do as a distraction so some time later on in their life depression hit even harder. when going through depression, people need actual help. not a list of things to do just to put the feelings aside so they could be happy temporarily. if i don’t get help and fix myself, i will end up fucking life up and guess who’s to blame for not reaching out of help? me! the day when i breakdown and seem weak in front of everyone will be my fault cause i didn’t ask for help. it’s not as easy as it seem to ask people for help with your mental illness, it’s not easy. people out there thinks that just cause you’re smiling every day means you’re happy, sometimes we put a face on so we don’t worry others. when someone tells you they are depressed:- don’t push it to the side- get them help right away, the longer you wait the worse it gets.- it’s not a joke.- validate their feelings- be there for them.- talk to them- don’t force them to do anything - be their mental support it’s hard to be there for someone who’s depressed when they just want to be left alone with their thoughts but don’t. depression starts off small and it doesn’t come all the time and it slowly silently takes over your life. there’s days where the depressed can’t get out of bed, can’t eat, sleep, or do anything. but we get judged and called lazy.sorry not all of us have a great fucking privileged life. i try to be there for my friends as much as i can but after loosing my bestfriend, i realize wow. there’s nothing i could have don’t cause society put out so much high standards that if you don’t look, talk, have certain things in your life or live a certain way. you’re a complete loser.then the music the government let out isn’t helping either, romanticizing suicide, encouraging people that they don’t need no one but themselves, trust none, all you need is you. but everyone needs help, love and support. that’s why there’s so many people in this damn world. but the music, social media made us all to be selfish. everyone of us is selfish. the world will end tragically cause of us. there’s so many conversations about this subject but no one takes it seriously.many suicides happen all the time cause of depression but no people will put the blame on something else. you know i think if i leave this fucking world, people would morn, but they would forget. those who don’t know why i died would make up stories and make a post about me just to seem like they were the victim but the reality of it is, no one was there for me. i tell people how i feel all the time but everyone just tells me how sorry they are to hear that. that’s why our human race is coming to an end.don’t get me wrong, i love animals but when someone sees an animal sad they go to the end to help that animal out but when it comes to an adult human needing help everyone so quick to turn a blind eye. why ? cause we’re not small and vulnerable looking ? some of us stay strong for our family and friends but at the end of the day. we cry ourselves to sleep and deal with this battles on our own. no one seem to care.. no one. english isn’t my first language so when reading this, take that into consideration. i wrote this out of frustration. so if it doesn’t make much sense, oh well. i said my piece but i know people will read this and they will feel awed, get all sad and have a little moment of realization but they will continue on with their day. i don’teven know why i bother..there’s no help, depression will kill humankind.it cost less to die than to get help. that’s how much the government cares for us! you want to survive ? they need your money! no money? oh well i guess you’re on your own bud. 
the fight has been way too long and way too draining
i’ve been fighting this depression for close to 8 years now and there is no end in sight. there isn’t even a path to the end. just more and more darkness. i feel like i’m nearing the end of my rope and i just want to give up. let depression win. i feel stupid for ever for a minute thinking i could beat it
i wish i had a friend
i'm new to this subreddit and i'm sorry if i make any spelling/grammatical errors in advance.&#x200b;i've been diagnosed with depression, exciting, right? i put in some effort every day (unless i'm having a depressive episode, then it's more of a half day).i approach people,i really try.i try to keep up my grades and i've even tried to take seriously my goal of putting on some weight (something that,for some reason seems way harder than it should be) i try to be positive,or at least don't show what's really going on in my head to the people around me.i'm talkative and i want to make the people around me just a little bit happier each and every day,and i try.even if i don't feel like doing it sometimes,i force myself to indulge in at least write or draw something every day. i know things are going to get better.they have to get better.i feel like i'm taking all the right steps towards recovery then why am i not happy? i come home every day and i'm so miserable. like i want to give up more and more with every passing day.i feel like reaching for help from someone like my parents is just like talking to a brick wall.they'll just tell me you're the only one who can make yourself get happier,and i'm trying to be that for myself,yet i fear that i'm not strong enough. i know i shouldn't need another person to make myself feel happy,but god damnit does it feel easier. perhaps if i had one other person rooting for me i wouldn't feel so alone anymore. i'm not a hateful person,i know i haven't done anything outrageous enough for me not to deserve love,but this is just my rational side speaking. and it's hard not to give into your emotions and self-doubt when you're consistently being proven wrong by everyone and everything around you.i feel like i will die alone or that i'm never going to be happy again.  i feel so stupid and desperate and pathetic. like all of my efforts have been in vain,like nobody will ever care about me. that my pain means nothing to nobody and that one day i'll be forgotten.&#x200b; i just wish i had a friend.
i have no motivation for anything
i’m so tired all the time, and as soon as i’m alone i want to just get in bed and sleep. even if i have plans for myself as soon as i get home all my motivation and energy just goes away. i feel guilty for sleeping all the time and letting my room and car get messy, i go days without showering or brushing my hair because i just can’t bring myself to do it. when i’m with friends/family/my boyfriend i’m always restless and want to get out or get up and do something, but as soon as i’m alone that feeling just goes away. i can’t even bring myself to lay in bed and put on a movie or read a book anymore
people who've lost the will to take care of themselves but eventually got it back, how?
how did your mindset have to change before you got back into maintaining hygiene, eating decent food, attempting a reasonable sleep schedule, etc.? at least the majority of the time, i'm sure all of us have better or worse periods. i've been slipping further into that black hole of self-neglect over the last couple years, and it's just making me more miserable. i don't hate myself or anything - therapy's helped with that - but i can't make myself care either.
if you have depression (like me) and your dating, please avoid making the following mistakes i made in my past relationships...

todays crippling considerations on my mind

an error occurred...sounds about right.

anyone that has been in my situation before? i would like a solution, im kind of tired of being that friend for as long as i can remember.

adults - working while fighting clinical depression and adhd + s.a.d.
my depression is a bit different than i've become accustomed to, especially with the added s.a.d. this year. my meds are keeping me above a baseline, but my lack of focus/numbness is making work really, really hard. i also have adhd (inattentive) which i am still waiting on my insurance to approve a medicine for and have not yet received medicinal treatment for.in short, i work at a civil engineering firm, and i do very detail-oriented work. lately the tediousness of it all has made getting anything done almost impossible, which leads to an increased lack of focus, and raises anxiety for fear of deadlines and guilt.i have been using my pto when absolutely necessary, but i'm not getting enough of a rest in between work days. just getting out of bed every morning feels impossible (i've been getting in at odd hours/leaving early, etc) let alone commuting and working a full day. i'm doing everything i can to hang on in 'survival mode' but the work place doesn't really care about all of that...i'm wondering if any of you have had to deal with this situation - specifically having to bill time to individual projects when you don't feel you're making much in the way of progress on them. how do you get through professionally?\*\*yes, i am seeing  a therapist weekly, i am on medication and waiting for another to be approved to start that treatment as well. i have a good support system, practice self care as much as i can, and listen to self-help books. no i am no/have never been suicidal.\*\*
i want to have a failed suicide attempt
i want to write my letters to everyone who deserves one, but i don’t know if i’m ready to die. i want everyone to know i’m sorry for everything, sorry to the point that i’m willing to die, but i don’t know if i’m ready to die. i want to be in the hospital and hear from people that actually care, but i don’t know if i’m ready to die. i want to have a failed suicide attempt so i can apologize with the same gravity as a suicide note, but i don’t know if i’m ready to die yet.
a text i made in a moment of vulnerability
ever since i was young, i've been lonelyeven when i talked to people, i felt lonely, for my head was somewhere else, and, in this place, there were only me and myselfseemed to be impossible to truly focus on anything around me. i got to the point where i could elaborate whole phrases that matched a given context, without even noticing it.two minutes later, *puff!* it was gone from my memoryi needed a link to connect me, my head, to the real worldthat link was you.it's not like the world before you was uninteresting, but you were way to astonishing to ignoreafter that, everything made more sense, everything became more interesting, and i thought it was alright, as it was in fact, for much longer than i expected that my mind would allowbut, what i failed to see is that this bound, as much as it had awoken me to the world, it became something so strong that it became exclusively unidirectionalthen, of course, loneliness came again with everthing else around iton this day, i made the worst mistake in my life.i took that bound and broke it into pieceswhat's the reason of selfpreservation at this point?this reminds me of a story...a giant lord, whose left hand wielded a great shield, and on the other hand, a great sword, which he used to protect the one he lovedsadly, fool as he was, he lost the one he loved, and threw away his shield, for he had noone else to protectnow he awaits for the final blow to take him awaymore than ever, i feel like i have no escape, no conection, no shieldthe anhedonia now surrounds mei loved you from the first moment i saw you, to my last secondthank you for showing me the experience of having a real lifefor you, it was worth every second
how do you guys manage your apathy/numbness?
just wondering, cause only physical exercise is working for me.
i haven't been taking my antidepressants, and now my mom hates me. [seeking advice]
i am 13 years old with mmd and gad. i was prescribed 100 mg of sertraline every morning, but i haven't been taking them. i don't know why, but taking meds feels... wrong physically and wrong in the sense that i feel i don't deserve them. so i've been putting them in the trash and the garbage disposal for about 2 or 3 months now. today, my mom confronted me and once i confirmed that i hadn't been taking them, she goes, you don't want to go to counseling, you aren't taking your meds, you know what? i'm not paying for this sh** anymore! if you really are depressed, well i can't help you anymore. i've done all that i can do.now i understand her saying she won't pay for the meds anymore is completely reasonable, but all my counselor did was make small talk with me for an hour. i just wish she would understand my point of view, that i don't mean to hurt her, i really don't. it's just all so overwhelming. i don't know what to do, i feel so much like a failure.
what if you're really a victim of other's deliberate wrongdoing?
i've had childhood abuse (beaten to bruises and welts many times, threatened with knife, mother saying she wishes she could kill me several times, mother tried hard to give me things and win my attention but suddenly turned around saying i'm a thief for taking her money, father complicit...i can go on for pages) though i was completely trouble free and pretty much a straight a student into a public ivy university.&#x200b;i've had workplace abuse. the company had financial reporting violations (they corrected errors before they went public), big and small plagiarism (including direct violation of patents and got sued for millions), and constant violations in labor laws. these all happened before i was there and many problems persisted for a long time. due to circumstances i worked very hard and it was easily 60+ hours per week for no overtime pay. i worked at home and on weekends without anyone telling me to do it. this was not in the us so i told myself i must be humble to accept a low wage to gain experience in international marketing. by the time i quit i had 70 projects on my shoulder and i burnt out badly. ceo offered me not only to stay but also he was willing to transfer me to the us branch so i can be on us salary. i declined. this was a company with 120 million revenue per year, most of which is earned from the us market.&#x200b;i am married in another foreign country. it is a very long story behind why i ended up in another country again. here i am not easily employable due to language limitations. i am working on it and working in a near minimum wage job to get by. my life went from good university, to seemingly good job, to seedy job, and now to minimum wage job. i told myself to be humble at all times and to persist in the circumstances i chose.&#x200b;i married my husband because of the usual reasons: we love each other, we get along, and all that. there are two more somewhat unique reasons; one is i am looking for a specific cultural upbringing that's similar to mine (half in the us, half elsewhere) and the other is that we are pretty much asexual. society dictates that if you can't please your partner sexually the relationship is automatically a failure. asexual partners are hard to come by. i have good reasons to stay. i wanted a prenup anyway so a prenup took care of our biggest difference - financial values.&#x200b;and now i determined this marriage is dishonest. i found out my husband is hiding debt and is unwilling to disclose spending nor earnings. he gave me a rough number in earnings. he admits he has never saved in his entire life despite having a high executive salary in the early 2000s. now he has chronic medical issues and i have been covering us with emergency savings. i pay all bills and he pays rent. &#x200b;i met my husband from the abusive company i talked about. my husband still works there. he caught his supervisor moving company money in and out of private accounts many times. most people know that whistle blowers will experience serious repercussions. so like most people my husband tried to keep his mouth shut. this company then started creative accounting. they fudged numbers on both taxes and financial statements for investors. this is a small non-us foreign subsidiary. the hq had not find out and the irs never audited them yet. my husband told his supervisors that they need to correct these numbers. they retaliated by reducing his salary in half. shortly after this incident a couple of accomplices bailed. my husband contacted several lawyers in this non us country and they confirmed all evidence pointed towards the company's wrongdoing. but even if legal evidence are in my husband's favor, he ideally needs to get out of the company first before he can sue and start reporting to the irs.&#x200b;my husband is dealing with age discrimination and can not find another job in his field. so i am completely in dark about our livelihood. no matter how i start my conversation, he won't say much about finances. so i know i need to start the conversation from elsewhere. i wanted to know what he truly thinks and feels regardless of my needs but he says my plans are fine and he will go with them. in reality he's not doing much about his own circumstances, let alone mine. i posted my husband's story in another subreddit. he had been through a lot in life too. many people say he's depressed. i offered help countless of times, and he says he is fine. we have no money for any type of counseling.&#x200b;the obvious is that i should get a better job and start saving us both from all the financial and emotional burdens we accumulated from our past relationship. i study as much as i can. almost everything is difficult because just around every corner there is punishment and there is trauma in both of us (work, family, relationship.) i have no friends and he has no close friends nor relative.&#x200b;so here is the catch. i never share these life stories except with my husband. playing the victim is never my thing. i just don't complain in real life period. but there is a point where i really break down. several points in life in fact, and this is one of the rough times. there is no justice and no good deeds go unpunished. i wish there is a genuinely constructive way to talk through being wronged by others. again i don't blame my husband for his circumstance but i do harbor strong hate from that company. these stories are just the tip of the iceberg. i need help here.
i love this. i keep it in my phone to look at when i'm struggling.

how do i seek help
im not really depressed to the point where ive stopped caring about anything or seriously considering suicide but ive found myself slipping into episodes of self loathing and havnt felt genuinely happy in years.this is starting to become a problem and i really dont want it to become a big one but i dont know how to ask for help.my family are probably the most insensetive to this kind of stuff and dont have any close friends either. where i live therapy is expensive as shit and we dont even have good therapists who can genuinely help.please guys how do i get someone to care enough about me to actually help me
should i talk to my therapist?
lately my depression has been at an all time low. i was at a similar state of mind around this time last year. from that i was able to get help. i finally got a therapist and for a while, i was stable. i didn’t experience suicidal thoughts and i finally was happy! now that has all come crashing down. i managed to push away the people that loved and supported me the most. and started emotionally depending on toxic people who are one of the main reasons i’m in such a dark place. i’ve started self harm and in the last month texted the suicide hotline three times. suicidal thoughts have consumed every aspect of my life and i’m tired of it. i want to be saved. i want to be happy again. but i’m scared to tell anyone. i’m worried when i tell my therapist she will make me go to a mental hospital for a week like what was recommend to me last year. the main reason i came on here is so someone could tell me what will happen to me if i do tell my therapist what i’ve been feeling. thank you so much. 
today's helpful depression post: i got a depression lamp and it's helping.
my last post a while back was on motivational showering. i hope someone got up and did it.       today's topic: you need some light. and you don't even have to face the world to get it if you aren't quite ready.    this isn't an ad- i don't care what lamp you get -so long as it meets the specifications needed to help with depressive moods. here's more info from the [mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/art-20048298).  i bought an ottlight, and it's an open square that burns my eyeballs every time i turn it on in the morning. there are other kinds, that's just what i ended up getting.  and they run as low as 35-40 bucks.   i've been using it for about three weeks now.     it's super useful in seasonal affective disorder but i also noticed a change in my energy levels and i really did feel less depressed, and i didn't even notice it at first.     ok this is starting to sound like an ad (lol), but i'm completely serious. last week i hit a low point, sleeping constantly. i get up at 7am every day so i turn on the lamp and keep it on while i'm getting dressed. it's also nice because it's hard to let yourself oversleep with a bajillion watts of uv shining into your face. so there's that.  it's nice to have a little light. this isn't nonsense or a placebo, science and me and my therapist all say they work.     have a good day everyone.      **why am i here, and why do i post things like this?** *i have bipolar depression, i've been working on not just existing but finding joy in this short life. i'm not sure why i'm here: this information might not be novel or applicable to you. i'm desperately clawing for a better life so i share my experiences and you can take them or leave them. if you're struggling anyone here should feel free to message me. i can't promise i'll respond right away, but i will respond.*
my counsellor told me i make her feel physically drained in our sessions. that i was effectively sucking the energy out of her. do i get a new counsellor?
i’ve been using a charity (cara) to receive some counselling. i was referred by someone i know who said it took a while before they started talking about the initial reason they sought counselling and that their counsellor understood and just let said friend talk about whatever in order to build trust. in my sessions i have been talking about a whole bunch of things that have lead me to where i am now. i only get up to 20 sessions (one a week) and since october 2017 i have only seen the counsellor for 8 sessions. sickness, training and holiday has meant that she has cancelled our meetings on multiple separate occasions. i briefly explained to two separate friends a few things about the meetings that i have had some issues with (including the lack of consistency) and they both urged me to make a complaint. i also mentioned the lack of meetings to my gp who encouraged me to change my counsellor. today, after asking me about my work she then told me that she was having trouble understanding what i was getting from the meetings. that i wasn’t talking about the things that originally brought me to get into contact with cara and told me this wasn’t general counselling. that it was specialised. she went on further to explain that every week (haven’t had sessions with her every week) when it comes to my specific meeting she feels drained. that she could just [she then lay back in her chair, closed her eyes and pretended to sleep]. she said i was resistant to talk to her and it was sucking the energy out of the room. now. as i’m writing this, i know full well that i would tell anyone who had experienced that from a counsellor should complain and/or make a request for a change in counsellor. however, i’m in such a vulnerable place that i’m not sure if what she did was right or not. i’m so utterly confused. i have always worried about being a burden on others and now she’s just confirmed that i am. because she’s a qualified counsellor. i haven’t spoken to her about why i went to cara in the first place because she’s been so unreliable and i don’t trust her. now i absolutely do not trust her at all and feel worthless after that meeting. in my previous meetings i have spoken about my lack of a support system and trust in others but every time i see her it seems like she is distracted or forgets our other meetings. i understand she probably sees a lot of people. i just thought notes/reading through notes would prevent that. also. one other thing. if you are not familiar with cara then this might be of no consequence to you but it is to me. i have spoken to her about not liking being touched. when i left my session last time she sort of rubbed my arm in one of those friendly ways that i had explained in my previous sessions make me feel incredibly uncomfortable when literally anyone does it. she then went to do it again today after i mentioned something about being touched earlier in the week and said “oh, i won’t hug you then.” in a kind of joking way. i just left feeling like my skin was crawling. 
i've suffered with depression for 10+ years, successfully coped & now i want to help others.
hey guys, i'm posting for the first time on reddit so forgive me for any mistakes in this post. here's my story, i'm 24 year old female in the caribbean, living with depression for almost 10+ years, i've gone through self harm episodes early on, which led to medications, several therapists and dealing with depression on my own. i was fortunate enough to have a supportive family and finding the right therapist who gave me the tools and techniques i needed to get through the worst of my depression. i learnt a lot on how to deal with my emotions, pick up on triggers and coping mechanisms, and even though i still deal with depression, i deal with it a lot better than before. i sucked at school early on, but as i matured i found my calling. information technology and pursued my bachelors degree (hons). in this field. i worked with a teammate and we've developed some apps and websites, entered a few competitions and won. things i never thought i'd be able to do several years ago. recently a fellow competitor introduced me to an upcoming competition the happiness competition and immediately i thought, 'what if i could develop something that could take all my years of dealing with depression in an app'. did some research and i didn't see anything out there that had my vision so i decided to push forward with it. so this is the beginning of that. while i could just go ahead and start developing, i want to develop something that would help a lot of people/users therefore i need to know your opinions and thoughts. this is part of the process of developing really useful projects and applications, so i'd appreciate if you would take the time to answer my survey. i would hope to start evaluating the responses by 9th august 2017 so i can finish my submission for the competition. regardless of being selected or not for this competition, i will continue to develop this application (it would just take some more time). thanks again and please share with anyone that could answer this survey. note: this survey is completely confidential and will not collect personal information such as names, emails, addresses, etc. link to survey: https://goo.gl/forms/n0xkvgasikuubhfz1update: closed the survey! collected 50+ responses which is enough to begin analysis! thanks to everyone who took part! 
hung myself in my closet using a length of cable (failed, obviously) should i go to the hospital?
i didn't know where else to ask this, sorry if this isn't the right sub for it. but, the title, and it happened a few days ago. my throat has been hurting recently, mainly because i was sick but i'm sure the failure of my suicide attempt didn't help things, should i get myself checked out? i also have what looks to be scabbed over carpet burn splotches on my shoulder, wrist and my knee, but i don't remember rubbing against carpet, could've been when i blacked out though.edit: thank you all for the words, currently in and out of sleeping and i'm a bit too lazy to reply to all messages and replies, thank you.
i feel like i need to just say this even though it won’t mean anything.
i’m sorry. i’m sorry. i’m sorry. i’m sorry for not being able to do anything. i’m sorry for being so helpless. i’m sorry for making people mad. i’m sorry for not being strong. i’m sorry for not being able to make wings for myself and reach my goals. i’m sorry for being weak. i’m sorry for not doing anything more. i’m sorry for doing nothing. i’m sorry for not helping. i’m sorry for just sitting here crying, i’m sorry for sobbing, i’m sorry for existing. i’m sorry for everything and anything i’ve ever done. i’m sorry i can’t love myself. i’m sorry i disappoint you. i’m sorry i’m an empath. i’m sorry i soak up everyone’s feelings and implode on myself. i’m sorry i pity myself a lot. i’m sorry i’m so broken. i’m sorry i hate mindfulness and get stressed. i’m sorry i draw. i’m sorry i create. i’m sorry i’m such a failure. i’m sorry i’m negative. i’m sorry i’m positive. i’m sorry either way. i’m sorry that i’m sorry.but most of all. i’m sorry i’m not able to do anything to help you. i’m sorry i can’t give you a hug. i’m sorry i couldn’t meet you. and i’m sorry it seems nobody cares.it may not count. but i care. i’ve said this before but i’ll say it again. i care. and i’m sorry i can’t do anything more
no one will love you until you love yourself
i've had this said to me, and i just have so many mixed feelings about it.  i'm not sure if it's true or not, but i can see where the people who say it are coming from.  it must be difficult to enjoy being around someone who is constantly putting herself down, like i do.  i'm not exactly encouraging anyone to love me.  but on the other hand, it's hard to be okay with the statement - i'm not sure if i'm ever going to love myself fully, so does that mean no one will ever truly be able to love me?  am i going to have to accept being destined for a lonely existence just because i can't seem to break this habit of hating myself?  how is that fair?generic, stereotypical quotes like this get repeated to me all the time, and even though i can usually sense when to respond *wow thanks, i'm cured* *(*/s), this one stupid phrase throws me for a loop every time.  if i could just forget it, and never have it said to me again, i think i'd be a lot happier.  at least i could be blissfully ignorant if it *is* true.
anybody else get annoyed as shit when somebody asks why you’re just lying there and demands you to “do something”
my god you are not helping
my girlfriend struggles with depression. personally i'm not familiar and i want to know how i can help as best i can.
i want to be as helpful and supportive as i can, but it's really hard for me to understand. what can i do? anything would be helpful, big or small.
wasnt feeling all that great today so i tried drawing my sona in like a happy vibes setting. maybe it'll help someone else to draw themselves like this?

i’ve come out of my 18 or so years of massive depression.
hi, (m36) as the title states, my depression is gone. my head is not foggy, and i don’t want to die. i don’t desire to sleep all day.the state of my depression was not telling anyone i’ve had it or getting any help. i work a miserable job at 80hrs a week 365. it made matters much worse. every morning i wanted to put a bullet in my head and it’s all i would think about. i wouldn’t let myself ever touch s gun because the desire to off myself was so strong. a few afternoons i was planning on it but what stopped me was the legal ramifications for the owner of the gun i had access to. after 18 years i had enough of the hopelessness and suffering. so what changed. so many articles seem to be disconnected on what to do to help yourself out. workout, social interaction, diet, etc. they are kind of right but it’s more than that. first i quit smoking anything that needed a flame. habits need a substitute most of the time. so i picked up a ciro vape, then eventually two more so i would always have access and not buy a pack. i still smoked in-between so don’t expect any rapid change. i felt the smallest amount better but still depressed.next i went to the gym. all i did was sit on the stationary bike and pedal. being overweight, some days it was 10 minutes, some it was 30. the point is i didn’t have to know how to workout. i didn’t feel any better. this is key. it took two months of this, 5 days a week, if i could even make it, for two months strait.  i felt miserable the whole time.i knocked out most, not all, fast food, carbs and sugar. taco bell, wendy’s, mcdonald’s. i have no time in the day so these were easy pickups. i opted for qudoba, chipotle bowls with no tortillas or rice. note i still ate burritos and fast food but not as much. the depressed can’t be expected to have a mountain of willpower. no soda. still felt like dying. i have no friends, no work friends, no time and a distant family. what time i did have i spent sitting at a pc. i didn’t talk to anyone about my depression and didn’t go on medication. it took about three months of mostly unsuccessfully trying to do these things and boom!! the fog of the depression war is gone. i have energy, i don’t want to die. i’m still at the same job with no friends but i’m better. i’m not saying this will help your situation but it did mine.it takes at least 3 months in my opinion before you even start to feel better. these articles don’t state just how difficult and for how long you need to do things before seeing results. tldr: i’m better3 months of:limited junk food, sugar, and carbs (thank chipotle salads)20~min on a stationary bike 3-5 days a weeksubstitute all smoking with 3 charging ciro vape sticks.still wanting to die the whole time. still in shitty job with no friends. ps: it sounds like all the other lame solutions but it is what it is i guess.
do people really ever get out of this? i can't battle this forever
i know people can sometimes feel not as bad. but does the entire depression really ever go away? so exhausted, so dissapointed whe  i eat healthy, work out, do a bunch of positive healthy decisions and i still feel bad. feel like i cant fight this forever. can it ever end? i still have a whole lot of life left, terrifies me to have to live it all
someone is telling me they are going to kill their self and i don't know what to do.
on facebook,this person began to message me. i do not know who they are in person. they began telling me about how they hate their life. i tried to be empathetic. then, they began to inform me the date they are going to kill their self. i tried hard to inform this person how people will miss them and that they have a reason to live for their god children. they refused and still told me they are going to do it. what do i do next, i do not feel safe with this. i feel this person will do it and i don't know what to do. if i report the chat to facebook, they will find out and not speak to me anymore. what do i do?update: so i spoke to the person more before i took the drastic decision of calling the police. we discussed a plan and how they will not kill their self so their god child will not live knowing that they died like that. it took time but i am glad everything is fine now.
12 yrs old and haven’t come out about my depression
not much, just contemplating life
so this is how i cope with my dysfunctional life
my wife of 23 years has a degenerative health condition since she was only 12. my heart went out to her the moment i met her because i felt she deserved just as much that life could give her as anyone else, she was cheeky, sarcastic, not a complainer about her serious health issues, and pretty damn hot in the looks department. unbeknownst to me and her, at age 20 i was a codependent people pleaser. the scene was set, the end inevitable. don't get me wrong, we had good times, but my perception of marital life and relationships were totally screwed up as a people pleasing, validation seeking, codependent person. whereas she was a self sustained self motivated person. now, 23 years later she's had both knees fully replaced, hip replaced, shoulder replaced, ankle fused… she's been on a lifetime of immuno-suppressant drugs that degrade all her organs, including her mind. as a codependent, it's been so soul destroy seeing her happiness decrease steadily over time, so deeply cutting into my own unhappiness as a codependent.now, even if she wants to, she mentally can't cope with more than a few minutes of my true self. you see, till 2 years ago, i maintained false people pleasing version of myself since childhood. this all stopped two years ago, when the wheels on the bus stopped going round and round and just fell off with severe social anxiety and deep depression.2 years later i now know my true self but my wife is too physically and mentally limited to enjoy sharing this new life of mine… after 23 years of getting use to me, its just too overwhelming for her because of her pain meds making her operate in a mental fog, not to mention her deteriorated brain function.so how the hell do i cope with this impossible dysfunctional situation? here's how i'm planning to…compartmentalization.compartment number 1:•	this compartment contains my true self. i generally only enjoy it on my own. i listen to sad songs, jaded songs… sounds depressing and yes, i do cry, but for me, listening to painful songs helps me to feel like i'm not the only one to have felt emotional pain, it feels self nurturing, like its ok to feel what i feel…validating. when i'm on my own in my separate bedroom for health reasons, its my emotional safe zone, where i can be who i want, need what i want, want what i want, be sad, be happy, be jaded, frustrated, angry, any feeling is ok… i'm in a state of complete and total self awareness and emotional allowance of any and all of my feelings without judgement, criticism, ridicule… just me being fully present and allowing of all feelings and emotions… my true self… the thing is i have the power to close this compartment, and open compartment number 2.compartment number 2:•	this compartment is devoted to my wife's happiness and emotional stability with only slivers of my true self. it's where i become whatever she needs and wants me to become to please her of my own choice and free will. however, my true self makes me refuse to watch lengthy television programs with her just to disfunctionally people please. but i try to listen to whatever she wants to say and talk about and share with genuine interest… but when she's done i put my headphones back on with my empowering music which stops me from wanting to over share my true self, new personal interests like a funny youtube video i liked… because she hates it, begrudges it, in her eyes i'm a bottomless pit of want that can never be filled so it's way too much effort for her to make it worth it… it's true, i'm needy… i wish i wasn’t but i am… oh yeh… she's menopausal now too. this strategy, although totally dysfunctional keeps me emotionally safe and gives my wife what she needs.we live a dysfunctional life, in a dysfunctional world… extreme degenerative sickness and pain is dysfunctional, and so… less than ideal, deliberate dysfunctional coping strategies are necessary for me… rather than automatic subconscious dysfunctional coping mechanisms.this being the case i probably still need a non judgy confidant friend for this to work to supplement my need for meaningful emotional connection with things that interest me personally. perhaps this is unrealistic and unsustainable, especially if i don't have that special friend to lean on… gets lonely, and soul destroyingly sad in this messed up world we live in… 
a long time ago i ran out of reasons to keep living. the only reason i still do is that im a pussy
evening everyone.&#x200b;well yea. as i said i want a reason to pull the trigger, to jump, down the bottle or whatever. at a closer thought, i think i need a reason.&#x200b;a backround might help, i honestly dont know.im a teacher assistant and a after school time employee (dont know the correct term, not first language) for kids in age 5-12. i like my jobb, and i love to work with kids, im good at it. but i have always hade the thought that it is not worth it, life that is. im not miserable, im not hated, i have very good friends and a nice family.this is so much more then many have and that might be what keeps me from doing it. i dont feel i have a reason, but at the same time i dont feel it is worth the hard work and the stress and the pain that life is. the enternal sleep sounds better everytime i think of it.i live in sweden so the living situation is not bad or anything. i live on my own in my fairly big 2 room apartment. i make enough money to live and do thing i want. im not a big spender, i get what i need and save the rest for the next stupid thing i like at that point in time.i have always hade a hard time comiting to something. school, girlfriends or hobbys they have all been donehalf-heartedly with less and less care over time.anyway, i have my gun on the table next to my computer screen. always loaded, always within reach. i have lost count of how many times i put in my mouth tasting the metal. i have never been scared holding against the roof of my moth or the side of my head. but i always stop at the last couple of seconds. at this point i am hoping and honstly dreaming of a tumor or a robbery turned bloody or a high speed car. just something to take the step for me.i am fully aware that my death will probably leave a lot of people sad, and if it is by suicide they will probably be wondering why. that might be the reason why it have never happend maybe not. im venting alot now i feel so i will move on. if anyone is interested i can always keep going in comments or something&#x200b;i would consider myself a very pedagogical person, i have always found it fascinating with the mind and the reason of choices, actions and beliefs. but no matter how much i try, i can not understand why i should, or more likely why i shouldn't, follow thru with it.&#x200b;i have long ago accepted my own death and everything that comes with it, now i feel done and i feel ready...i have forgoten the reason i even wrote this, but i feel i need to tell someone. someone might even change my mind or feel the same.&#x200b;thank you for reading and i hope you all have a nice day. im going to bed
how do i stop having that pit in your stomach depression feeling

his and hers depression
hey reddit,i have a story of love and shadows.my partner and i both have depression. we are adults. we live together. we have our ups and downs, as couples do. we met through work, dated, moved in, got engaged over the past two years. in that time my life has gotten more difficult and theirs has fallen apart. when we met we may have been different people. they had recently gone back to school to try and work towards a degree. they were doing well in school. they were working. life wasn’t great, but it was tolerable. we had fun. we studied together. we encouraged one another to be the best we could be. they were always up front about their depression. i hid mine. they had doubts about what they were doing, uncertainty that they were on the right path. they can do anything they set their mind to. they are smart, funny, gorgeous. their laughter is music and their smile is my sun.then they changed jobs.  they went from part time to full time working second shift. it was hard to keep up on schoolwork at that time. then their uncle died. and between work and struggling with the loss, they started to slip. assignments were missed. so were classes.  then their grandmother passed after years of struggling through alzheimer’s. then they stopped going to school. was ready to end it. what followed was my helping their parents get them to an er for help. they were admitted to a psychiatric unit. i visited them every day. since that admission someone at work dug into their medical records and spread that they were “crazy” around their workplace. they stopped working. lost their job at the largest employer in our area. they will not be eligible for rehire due to “delinquency from duty”. their withdrawal from university was not processed and they failed out. they have not been able to find work since. they have not been able to find motivation to go back to school since. they have tried medication, but are now done trying that because nothing has worked. they stick with therapy, but see no improvement on that front. they have no friends to hang out with and feel inadequate around my friends and family. their family is verging on toxic and is neither very supportive or understanding. on the whole, they do not cope well with the monotony and disappointment of daily life. one might sympathize. it is perhaps not ideal to be at home with one’s thoughts all day.during our two years, more responsibility has been shoveled upon my shoulders at work. i don’t have the time or energy anymore to be the partner i would like to be. our therapists tell us to have weekly date night, which sometimes happens. i work 60-80 hours most weeks to pay my student loans off and pay for my house, bills, etc.  money is tight. time is precious.and we’re both tired.sometimes it feels as though we are the only joy in each other’s lives. sometimes we feel responsible for the other’s problems.i am more tired and more angry than i have ever been. i cannot fix their life. i cannot give them friends or a sense of purpose. most days feel like a struggle to give them a reason to live.i live with the love of my life, but we are both so dissatisfied with what life is. we have our separate depressions that do not play well. mine stemming from success and the price thereof. theirs from the weight of being unable to make headway anywhere in their life.i am a young physician. i am academically and personally familiar with depression. i live with it. i treat it on a daily basis.and i still don’t know what to do.
trying this reaching out thing i guess
i have crippling depression that comes in and out of my life. i’m “properly” medicated and meet a psychiatrist twice monthly. right now, the depression is crushing. not often do i turn to thoughts of suicide, just right now it seems like such a sweet release. this isn’t the first time in my life these thoughts have called to me... i wouldn’t say i’m suicidal right now, as much as i’m so unmotivated and wholly crushed by this depressive experience that i don’t know what to do next. i’ve devised some goals to work toward to hopefully lead me to a healthier lifestyle and mental wellbeing, since at the moment i spend as much time as possible in bed, asleep, losing my days while i wallow. i feel like tremendous shit. i have a job that i’ve had for five years now, a partner of nearly three years, and a nine year old child and plethora of animals. somehow this has all stayed together among my descent, but the whirlpool is crushing my will. i guess i just need to know that it will get better, that there’s another side of this, because so far in my life there hasn’t been a time of improvement. does depression go away? the thought of not being here for my family is enough to keep me around, but i also feel like a tremendous loser and sometimes think that the idea of someone is often better than the reality. this is illustrated especially in my relationship with my mom, who died from cancer a year and a half ago through medically assisted death and whose life was miserable during her final years. now, when i think about my mom, i remember the fun, outgoing, dancing on the table mom that i once had and miss that person for me, and for my kid. however, that person hasn’t been around for decades, but now that her shitty misery is away from my line of sight, my periphery remembers the joyful parts of her. i’m a joyful being. this energy is not mine, but i don’t have energy to take it. i don’t have the will to overthrow this. mental illness is crippling me right now, and that feels pathetic and bullshit. now i can’t keep plans, meet up with people who care about me, or do much of anything beyond minimal body necessities and be in bed. i don’t know how to do the next step. thanks for reading all of this. tldr; i’m a whiny person with depression whose super loved but often craves being freed of death. i’m turning to the internet community, at last. please send words of encouragement. i need to know it gets better and it’s worth it. 
been struggling with my mental health for the last six months. recent high-profile suicides led me to question - what are we living for? hope my conclusion can help someone...

rehab is for people who have problems in life as a result of drug addictions, i have drug addictions as a result of problems in life.

two of the best paragraphs i've read about the onset of depression - a sad history of beautiful nostalgia - jason myers

september is national suicide prevention month

i am in the need of help.
i am 11 years old and i have a hard time adjusting at home since my mom abuses me. i also live in a country where if you tell the cops they would just laugh. i am tired of  getting shouted and hit at.
i wish i wasn't born
i've  been struggling with people and mostly with my self for my whole life.  why do i have to be the one thats always ignored even by teachers. why  do i have to be the one who was born without knowing my origin nor who i  belong to. why do i have to be the one who sometimes goes for as long  as 2 days without eating. why do i have to be the one who is always  ignored at school and looked down upon. why do i have to be the one who  lives in the store he works at why do i have to be the smallest kid in  my school. i love it when kids at my school get attention or recognition  for the smallest things, while i can barely get any medical help when i  am sick. the only way i get to interact with people is when my boss  says go clean the washrooms, or go check on this angry customer. i swear  i would try to buy pills to kms but the pills costs more than me. but  i'll admit i don't have the balls to kms. i would literately pay anyone  money to have a talk with me.

what to say when you want to book an appoitment with a psychatrist?
so i've been meaning to make an appoitment with someone for a year now, and never found the motivation or strenght to do it.i'm just out of a very dark/suicidal thoughts week, and i want it to be over, and therefore finally seek professional for good.one of the thing that always kept me from calling is, what do i say?&#x200b;i know it sounds silly, but, really, what do i say lol? i have no ideais just hi, i'd like to book an appointment. enough? or should i make it sound like i \*really\* need help? (because i do)&#x200b;thanks everyone, and have a good one&#x200b;&#x200b;edit : ok, i just called, phew. i talked to the doctor directly, and he sounds nice enough. the call went well, up until the end when i stuttered when i said goodbye. it shattered my self confidence, i hate myself lol. but at least i booked 2 appointments, yaay! thank you for your advice everyone!

from top student to worst. about to fail my thesis
(this is my first post on reddit) hello everyone,for my background, i am a ma student, studying abroad (in europe) since my undergrad.all the time throughout my primary to undergrad, i always finished at the top of the class. i even excelled my university entrance exam in my country.i luckily got a scholarship to study abroad. but this scholarship is actually a kind of 'slavery' contract that promises to pay my study but in turn has to work in the public service with double time of my study. this scholarship also does not let me choose but forces me to study in the programme that would suit my career the most.although i've always experienced up and down even before coming abroad, it didn't cause me much problems or maybe i've successfully tried to ignore it. as you'd guess, i didn't choose both my undergraduate and graduate programme. but my undergraduate degree was still enjoyable to me and i finished at top 10% of my uni. but since i got into this master, which is research based master, my life has changed. i chose, or more accurately was forced to choose what i do worst and don't like at all. since the beginning of master, i failed the exam for the first time and it hit me hard. my motivation dropped to almost none.in the second semester, i failed again in another course. and in almost every course, i finished last or in the lowest tier (grade paper shows student ranking). as i'm always competitive in my study, this made me feel anxious and not want to study anymore.already, i never liked this programme, i started getting more and more dumb, not enjoyed writing papers, avoiding my dissertation's supervisor. besides the study, i quite failed miserably in every single aspect of my life. i am not close to my family. i've lived with my grandma who's now 88 and has dementia. my dad passed away when i was 9. my mum and older brother have always had issues with me. she liked yelling, threatening me and always told me that i chose the wrong choice and that i should have had stayed home. i don't like doing sport. i am very introverted, even anti-social. i don't like making friends. i avoid going to almost every party with my classmates. i had a long distance relationship until last year. we ended it partly because of my obligations to go back home when i finished my study. next two weeks, i had to submit my dissertation which i've avoided doing since last year.i became uninterested in studying, which i feel like is the only thing i do well. now i have nothing that i do well. i suck at everything. i avoided studying and became addicted by other things (game, internet, sex). yesterday, it was my first time seeing a psychologist. she gave me some advice, telling me that i lacked motivation because i am caught up with these obligations. i'll have another session with her next week. i told this to my supervisor which is very underdtanding of my situation. but i don't know if this is sufficient enough to postpone the deadline. if not, i'm likely to fail this class, and probably the entire ma. i don't know what i'm doing and should be doing right now. i cannot work because of all anxiety i'm giving to myself. last two years, suicidal thoughts have come and gone periodically. i've felt empty buti've always refused every help from other people and that because i've thought i'm not depressed. what am i? anyone in the same situation?
a decisive victory in my war with depression
hopefully this story will help someone. if i can save just one person from learning this the hard way like i did, then i will be happy with that.&#x200b;i grew up under the boot of an abusive dad who convinced me i am useless and worthless. my ever-watching mother would basically do nothing about this abuse. she should've got me out of that house before i was even born, but she only suggested we escape when i was 17 and the damage was done.i failed every single subject in school and dropped out of college soon after escaping my dad. i figured my life wasn't gonna go anywhere, so i got myself xbox live, reconnected with my childhood best friend, and went on to play xbox with him for 16-18 hours every day for four years. unlike my friend i never worked a single day of that four years, except for a three-month voluntary position where i regularly dealt with an extremely toxic individual. within a few years, my friend met a girl on xbox and she was long distance, so i was basically a spare part from then on. they'd spend 99.9% of the time texting each other during games, leaving me basically by myself but with the knowledge that i'm not important.after that four year period i met my now-ex over xbox. i was a total virgin in every way - and i seized this opportunity with everything i had. she lived 300+ miles away and i didn't care; i was about to use my whole life savings if it meant finally having a girlfriend. she turned out to be just as abusive as my dad, and she consumed 1.5 years of my life before i dumped her.after another three years of bumming around doing nothing but odd temporary jobs, i got into one where i met a lot of people at once. some of them were my age; some fresh outta school, and some almost retiring age. i asked the older ones what they do throughout the year since this is temporary. they said well, i'll finish up here; go on welfare until summer; work at \[factory\] a few months; welfare again until winter then i come back here.now, it was in that moment i realised: if i don't do something soon, that'll be me. i'll be coming here in 40 years' time, telling some kid the same thing. my depression when i realised that was nothing compared to the sheer dread i felt of the direction i was heading: i'd never have savings; i'd never be off welfare; i'd never have a family; i'd never have nice things; i'd never have holidays; i probably wouldn't even have a pension to look forward to.i decided to take advantage of my current position. my mother disabled but is able to support me financially. i can live at home, get a qualification and my life would take off from there. i just needed to make a list of what i want to do, and use a process of elimination until i'm left with one career. i worked out that this would be financially doable, then i talked with my mother, and she agreed to support me.and now, my first year of education is almost complete. i've truly excelled! i've had distinction-level results in all of my exams so far. i'm also doing maths and english classes to bring those grades out of the dirt, and on my mocks i'm working at a pass! i'm well on my way to my dream job, and the next step is an apprenticeship.i tell you what: this has totally destroyed one manifestation of my depression. i truly thought i was useless, and in a sense my old lifestyle facilitated that feeling: i had no hope of getting a full-time job; i never saw the point in learning new skills; i spent all day playing stressful video games; and i could always feel that my life was wasting away. sometimes i'd be sitting in my chair and i'd think: i'll still be sat here this time next year, doing exactly this. and i'd be thinking exactly that right now if i didn't take this step.
found out a few weeks after my wedding that my wife is dying. everything is falling apart.
my wife and i were married in mid october. she is my favorite person. we tied the knot on top of a mountain in the adirondacks. it was a beautiful day. after the wedding, she started showing some signs of depression, which we chalked up to the fact that we were still living with my parents. soon after christmas, she started getting a headache that wouldn’t quit. then came double vision. after maybe three days of vision problems and maybe a week and a half of a headache, i took her to urgent care on january 16. a series of tests and grim-faced doctors revealed she has a very aggressive, high-grade, incurable brain cancer. she’s currently in the middle of an intensive 6 week treatment period of daily radiation and chemotherapy. we were told originally that hair loss would be minimal, mainly confined to the areas where the radiation was focused. i guess her doctor was wrong because this week it started falling out rapidly. the same doctor said it will likely all fall out this week. she’s also started getting incredibly tired this week. i’m of course her primary caregiver, so i’m tired all the time as well. she knows almost all there is to know about her cancer - the name, the gravity of the disease, the fact that it’s incurable - but doesn’t know the statistical nightmare of the thing. 21% of people with her diagnosis are alive one year after diagnosis. 5% are alive 5 years out. the location of her tumor, and the fact that only about 50% could be surgically removed make her long term odds even lower. she was so optimistic when she was in the hospital that we chose not to tell her these statistics for fear that depression would keep her from living her remaining days. i don’t know if was the right decision or the wrong decision, but it was the decision we made. now i don’t know how to cross that bridge. she just turned 32. i’m 33. we were just about to start our lives. she worked a shitty job to support my way through law school. i had just recently passed the bar. nothing gives me joy. i’m just stuck watching this train slowly barreling toward us, and i’m unable to get out of the way. i’m starting therapy on friday, she’s starting thursday, and i’m hopeful that that will be a positive step, but my grief is really getting in the way of my life, and hers. i don’t know what exactly i’m looking for here. i’m just endlessly sad and needed to vent.
it's okay.

does anyone else get a depression in their stomach feeling sometimes?
sometimes i feel it in my chest and entire body too

very depressed because of messed up career path
i'm 23 years old and i've never found my path in life. i tried college after graduating high school but i couldn't find the major i wanted and i hated the prerequisites so i dropped out after a year (i regret it completely).i was a deadbeat afterward for the next couple years till my dad passed away in late 2016. my whole world shattered and i was lost. i thought about joining the navy but couldn't imagine it working out in any shape or form for my widow mother and girlfriend. a friend recommended mechanics and i looked into it. almost lost a finger while helping my mechanic friend on a truck one day and i decided afterward to look elsewhere. i then thought about welding but that didn't last long. then it came down to equipment operator but turns out the trades as a whole were not meant for me. to summarize, i've never in my life had any taste of working with my hands and getting dirty. it just was never in my upbringing or my family. now the above i listed were nothing more than pursuits. as for actual jobs, i am ashamed to admit that i've hopped around quite a bit. i started working three years ago after my father's death. i started at amazon part-time for a few months but got laid off when the season ended. reapplied for amazon full-time for a few more months. working 10 hours a day was hell and the quotas to fill were simply unfeasible for me. i was forced to leave after making too many errors.then i tried working at rite aid. shortest stint ever, lasted for maybe two months. they kept leaving me utterly alone at the front counter. extremely understaffed (there would be one other person up front alongside me at most). had to serve ice cream, handle the cash registers, and do stocking, while also performing go backs, and making sure the floors and bathrooms were clean. eventually was overwhelmed and social anxiety got the best of me and i left. then i tried security for a while. i'll say three months. essentially got fired because the supervisor blamed me for stealing paperwork. it was just bs. enough said.finally i found work at a pier 1 warehouse. best job yet. kind of fun and people there are great. been there for four months now. sadly, it's my longest stint yet. i hope to last much longer, but i was hired as a seasonal so who knows really?i recently came to the realization that i want to work close to nature and maybe help preserve it and take care of it. i've loved exploring the outdoors, hiking, and collecting rocks, minerals, and observing insects since the age of five. i tried posting on r/parkrangers for advice (i was also considering a career as a park ranger) and i explained my situation and everything. someone accurately pointed out that because my job history so far is all a mess, the odds are stacked against me, and having not stayed at a job longer than a few months is a huge red flag, which is understandable. he is right and i feel miserable now. i regret job-hopping so frequently. i hate my resume right now; i want to tear it up and start all over. my whole direction in life has been a mess. people around me have had their lives figured out from an early age. my friend's father is the head of an operator's and engineer's union and introduced mechanics to him in his preadolescence; his path was clearly laid out for him. i've never really had an idea what to do. i just love being outdoors and hiking; i love the snowy mountains and the trees. i don't know what career suits me there but apparently my job history is such a mess that such doors may not open for me anyway. i can't prove i'll stay committed to anything given my experience so i guess i'm screwed. i need support because i've never been so lost as i am now. thanks.
i just saved my friends life tonight.
my friend who i just recently starting dating has been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now. we met through working at the same mall and she just seemed off today, ignoring me and my attempts to talk. so i figured she's done with me and doesn't want to talk. she messaged me after she clocked out that she has her knife and is considering suicide. after talking to her on snapchat i decided the best thing for me to do (since i'm stuck at work) is call the non emergency service number. they found her wandering on the side of the road, and took her in and she now is going to stay in a psychiatric hospital for 3 days. i feel like i did the right thing but i can't stop feeling guilty at the same time. i've had to do this before on a differnt friend and felt the same way. i guess if she hates me for this then i'll at least know i did my best?
in a bad place. nsfw maybe?
i’m pretty bad off, but i don’t know how to fix it anymore. sorry for long rant, i’m hoping it will help a little even if no one reads it. i’ll start off with- i’ve had anxiety and depression since i was about 8 years old. i’m 22, almost 23 now. i also have dermatilomania, where i pick at my skin until i bleed and then pick at it more until i leave massive scars on my body. my target area is my chest. i’m a woman. that’s where some of my anxiety comes from, but compulsive skin picking is cyclical. and anxiety is just a part of me at this point.  i’m in college. i started off really well, but now i’m one year from graduating and am failing my classes. i’m fairly certain i’m failing 3/4 of them this semester. i just can’t do the work. not like it’s a large course load. but i just can’t do it. i look at the blank computer screen and start crying. i word vomit or keyboard smash til it’s no longer blank, and start violently sobbing or going to the bathroom to puke. i’ve spent almost an hour trying to type this out. i don’t know what to do or how to stop. i am an english major. writing is what i do. i love writing, even assignments are fun. i know what to do and am fairly good at it. my classes are amazingly fun. but i can’t put pen to paper. i can’t type it out. i just can’t. i don’t know why. i’ve tried everything i can think of. it’s like there’s a mental block. this semester has been terrible. i should have been in the hospital numerous times for high fevers, or possibly breaking my foot, and other health issues. heck, i’ve been suicidal and should have gotten help. instead, i just lay on the floor. there’s also been family emergencies, death of beloved pets, drama i just can’t take anymore, heartbreak, and just more than i can handle. i’ve missed so many classes. i’ve talked to my teachers about the things i can talk about- my car breaking down, going to the hospital with my dad when he had a heart attack, things that are obvious. they’ve worked with me, given me extensions on my papers, but i can’t meet them. i can’t, and i don’t know why. i try and i sit there and maybe get one sentence in. i have two 8 page papers due today, and i’m here instead because it physically hurts to try and type it out. this hurts as well, but he’ll at least it flows out of me. the councilors at the school aren’t the right fit for me anymore, after my coucelor graduated and moved. i’ve tried going to them, but they don’t help. there have been times they’ve made it worse, and i had to go sit in a crowded library or cafeteria so i didn’t go and hurt myself because i couldn’t trust myself alone after a session. i don’t have health insurance. i don’t have money. i don’t have any way to get to a counselor. i barely have enough for gas to get me to school. im past my breaking point and barely holding on. i want to get my degree. i want to graduate. i don’t know what i want to do when i graduate, but i have life plans. i’m so tired of being tired. of sleeping my days away. of being so heavy bodied i have to force each step, or physically week i can’t lift my backpack. not because i am physically weak, but because it’s too much work mentally. of being so hungry after i eat. if not comprehending things in class. of forgetting. of always looking at the dark side. of hiding my pain, because the one thing that hurts me more than anything is if one of my friends sees my suffering and i bother them. i’m tired of the body aches from nothing and panic attacks out of no where and being so stressed i end up in the bathroom puking. i’m so tired of not being able to think or do without some outside force acting on me.i’m tired of doctors not listening to me. i have so many health problems. not all of them are caused by me being over weight. some probably, but not all. i’ve ordered horomones on amazon to try, because i haven’t had my period in well over half a year. guess what? since taking them (over the counter), most of my dermatilomania has cleared up, and some of my depression has gone away, as well as other little things such as temper have improved. not all obviously, or i wouldn’t be here. but it’s better than being so down i can’t move, when i was so bad i curled up in a ball and wished i had the courage. now i can pretend to be normal. anyway, i’ve obviously had an imbalance, but no one would believe me when i said “i think something is off with my horomones”. i’ve been from doctor to doctor to doctor. no one will give me time, nor listen when i explain whats wrong. i don’t have time nor money to get blown off and not listened to. i know my body. i know when something is wrong or off, even though it’s been off for so long i can’t remember normal. i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t know what to think. or where to go. i’m on the edge of suicidal again, i can accept those thoughts as stupid without feeling them, but it’s not far. the stupid thing is, the only thing keeping me alive are my fish. unike my cat and dog, they can’t eat me if i die. if i die, they likely will too cause no one in my family knows how to take care of fish. they are my lifeline. and now back to writing, then off to work. which is a whole ‘nother story but i think i’ve exhausted my emotion enough i might be able to work for a while. anyone who has read my trainwreck, thank you.
i'm not sure if i am actually depressed, but something feels wrong.
i'm always hesitant to say that i am actually depressed, because i know people who have had a traumatic past event, abusive relationship, and losing a close loved one. i however, had a pretty good childhood, never really had an emotionally scarring event, or deep emotional loss. yet, i feel so empty. i have lost interest in things that make  me feel happy. i have trouble displaying emotions  even to ones i care the most about. i have little motivation to do the things i love. i just feel like an empty shell, but i feel guilty calling this depression because i don't know the cause of it. i really have no idea why i feel this way. i'm very confused and feel very alone, and even though i know there are people who care about me i'm scared to talk about this to them. i just don't  know what to do.
im so fucking angry all the time and i dont know why.
i dont have any «reason» for my situation. maybe im just ungrateful.i have been blessed and privileged in many ways. still, i have been lonely and depressed since as long as i can remember. ive been wanting to kill myself from the age of 10.i have always been angry. i have always wanted to die. i have always been worried and anxious. i have never felt excited/joyful about anything or anyone.i have always known that i was weird. maybe it is autism only nobody noticed because i am a female and seem successful/normal enough from a distance.i am unable to keep friends. i dont get any joy from social interaction, just more anxiety. i am unable to trust anyone or expect people to like me. and to be fair i usually dont like them either.people are too stressful and unpredictable. i can «act» like a normal, sociable person but its just an act and i sometimes forget the script and do/say weird things. i live a very isolated life because of this. no friends or boyfriend.i am supposed to be a grown up, but i am unable to act like one and id rather just give up.i hate myself and the world so much. i am so angry i want to hurt myself every day.i wish my parents had had someone else. 
if you are feeling worthless right now... i hope this video helps. you're not alone.

today, i woke up. tomorrow, i hope i don't.
today i woke up, just like i always do, sprawled out on my mother’s sofa. an old, unkempt duvet barely covering me and a thin pillow that’s never made a difference. my mother acknowledges that i’m awake and begins to make a flimsy, diluted coffee to help me open my eyes.i then proceed to spend the next 14 hours on a computer, or my mobile. i have some of the best ideas in the world: opening facebook, closing facebook, a few random videos mostly of people reacting to trailers, and of course \(my personal favourite\), porn in the night time when everyone is asleep. i occasionally get to show my appreciation that i have a little sister who is doing wonders at college \(all a’s\) and will be going onto to a bright future. i get to be reminded of this daily and of course, i smile, and i show my love and how proud of her i am. i then get to be reminded how i have no job, can barely hold down a job, and then how i have no job.my mother washes up, complains at me for never washing up, and then cooks dinner and complains at me for not cooking dinner. she tells me she loves me… i know she does. my little sister tells me she loves me… i know she does.if i thought differently, i would already be dead. i know i would, because i would have either cut my wrists several years ago or hanged myself recently. every day, that thought consumes my mind: how i could end everything about me. remove that pathetic little man, who at 28, can’t manage a job. that pathetic little man who cries himself to sleep most nights because he can’t see himself having a future. that pathetic, looser of a man, who has no friends and must rely on his mother and little sister to have any form of sustained life.do i have any goals? nope. any life ambitions? nope. any prospects? don’t be daft.so why am i writing this? i haven’t the foggiest… maybe, deep down i need more than two reasons to keep myself alive. more than just my mum and little sister as reasons to keep going. i even wrote a list of pro’s and con’s of dying today. that was new. it was exciting.so tonight, i will cry myself to sleep once again. then tomorrow, i will wake up, sprawled out on my mother’s sofa and then cycle repeats.
every little thing really counts
background= 21 years old male, diagnosed with clinical depression since age 12. and recently diagnosed with type 2 manic depression( in other words bipolar) this may seem like such a small thing to many, but for someone like me who’s never had much( money, food, love, and nothing but a lifestyle of drug use and gang life)...but what happened today at work is making my cry tears of joy(which hasn’t happened since i was a little kid) was that my coworker brought me green tea flavored cookies today. she said she was at the grocery store and saw those cookies and remembered how much i love green tea so she went out of her way just to get those for me. of course i don’t like eating “cookies”, but it was just the thought that really counted. nobody in my life has ever thought about me to the extent that they would ever even have the thought of me cross their mind unless i’m physically present. it was embarrassing af, but i literally burst into tears and gave her a hug in the middle of work lol. my point is that for everyone here that is depressed, i would reccomend you stay more focused on the little things in life. it will definitely ease the heaviness of your heart. it obviously won’t cure depression(nothing can cure clinical depression), but it’s just a tip. i know i’ll probably go back to my depressive state once the day is over, but i will never forget my coworker...ever, no matter how many drugs i do, people like that will always be in my heart 
the thoughts in my head are scary...

share something good! trying to stay positive!

i hate christmas.
that’s it. i hate christmas. i don’t like being with my family, except for when i’m not with them. when i am with them i hate it. i have no friends. no social life. so without my family i have nothing. what can i do if i feel i have nothing when i have more than other could ever dream of having? 
six innovative ways to fight depression

i called the suicide hotline and got a busy signal! hahaha!
i just busted out laughing. at this stage the way the world hates me is just comical! my doctor changed my anti-depression meds and they are hitting me very hard. no one takes me seriously. mostly because they'll all be so much happier when i'm not here anymore. then they don't have to act like they care anymore.good news about the new meds, all of the fear i had in leaving the planet isn't there anymore. i'm so calm in the thought of hanging myself that i am actually happy i got the new meds. don't know if i'll ever do anything, but if i do, at least i know i'll be able to get it done instead of chickening out like i always do. 
i don't know if this will help anyone but here:

how did you know you had depression? what was your signal to visit a doctor?
i visited a doctor because i had been crying without a reason. he said i'm in depression. i don't feel like it. is that wrong?
help me get rid of the thought that i'm not enough please
i just have periods of time where i will have my mind that tells me: if i don't have anyone in my life and all my friends are in a relationship, it means that i'm just not enough for anyone. i never had anyone in my life. it would mean that i'm not interesting enough. not loveable enough. that i'm not worth it. that spending time will me, and love me is a complete waste of time.i consciously know that i probably have something good in me (well i do hope so at least). but when i am spiralled into these thoughts, i just can't get out of it. can anyone help me and tell me how they get out of this please? i literally feel my heart breaking because of my mind. thank you.
morning disgust
hello there. been diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. now i got rid of medications, and there has been no problem for month or two. school started and i noticed how often i would get sick due to weather change. i also started to be more nervous in open spaces, even at home. but the worst thing that came back are the mornings... each day, in early hours, i would wake up, with sudden... disgust? i dont know how to explain it... basically the thought of getting up is terrifying. it feels like torture. whenever i would think of something positive, my brain would deny it, or even worse, make my positive thoughts negative. telling me i am all alone, that this is forever, and that i am a bad person for not doing anything about it. i know i am very sensitive person, but i havenť seen anyone so terrified by this. people would judge me and tell me that it's my duty to go to school. they would start explaining it to me like i am some stupid outcast who thinks he can do whatever he wants. i know that i canť, but this issue is stopping me from doing so. now that it's back... i am terrified more than ever. it is easier to overcome it by getting up with no thought, but it is still hard and life consuming. i don't know what to do, have you ever experienced something like this?
why does family stop being supportive?

i feel like i’m losing my grasp of reality.
hello, everyone. first time poster on this sub-reddit. thanks in advance to any of you who may read this.   i’ve reached the point where i know i need professional help, but i’m lost on where to start. i’m so scared of opening up about my mental illness. i can’t talk about it without losing composure and breaking down, but then again i have daily breakdowns anyways.   i’ve opened up to one of my friends about it, but they don’t really offer any help. the only time the intrusive thoughts, suicidal ideation, or anxiety dies down is when i’m self-harming. i know this isn’t a healthy coping mechanism, but i’m not really worried about my health. i’ve lost the motivation for everything. i haven’t eaten a real meal in a couple days, and have probably gotten 16 hours of sleep this week. i don’t have any friends anymore because i never talk to them, and my room is a reflection of the mess in my brain.    i’ve become absent-minded, oblivious, and forgetful. i feel like i’m not awake half the time, and it shows. i’m constantly messing things up at work or forgetting things where i once had no problem. i have no clue how to socialize with strangers, and often stay home over going anywhere. i’m tired of being this way but it’s all i know.
i miss who i used to be.
except, i hated myself  back then too. it just wasn't as bad. i could laugh. i could joke around. i had motivation to do.. anything. now i'm just sucking the life out of everything, and i find no joy in anything.i guess i'm looking for support here. i don't even know anymore.
it’s been four month off meds,my depression is getting worst now
i don’t have friends,i join sports but couldn’t make friends.i work for my family and this year i am already 29.i have been feeling depress lately,i couldn’t control my fap habit,i smoke 5-6 sticks a day and the only positive is that i took cold shower and try my best to work hard and not avoid social situation.its still not working,i am still depress
the woman i was excited to spend the rest of my life with died little more than two weeks ago...
i miss her so much. we were a pair to beat a full house and now she's gone, and she's missing out on everything and i'm missing her so much. she was my other half... i feel incomplete and empty. i feel like i died with her, and often i wish i had
i don’t know what to do anymore
i just feel like nobody gives a shit or wants me around. my family never wants to do anything with me and my job makes it clear they would get rid of me if they could. i’ve spent the entire week either at work or alone. i worked 12 hours on christmas and then spent the rest alone. my husband stayed the night at his parents so i didn’t even get to see him. i’ve seen him about an hour since christmas. since i’m scheduled so much this week he isn’t even attempting to try and spend time with me. it hurts. i just feel like i’m useless and unwanted. i have no friends. i don’t really have anybody anymore. i hate my life.
suicide attempt
yesterday i attempted to kill myself, i walked to the bridge, pass the guard and facing the river my legs got heavy and my heart pumped faster. than i realized, the river here is not so deep. than i googled a best way to do it, and the first result was, the crises phone number. adn that's hoe i am here now, telling you that the desperation and fear of things not working cannot guide you thru things, trust your support system, seek for help, and take you meds as they have been prescribed.
was doing good...
i've been depressed since i was a kid, finally got on meds this year. overall i've been doing really well. getting better, targeting negative thoughts, working on communication, etc.the last two days i've hit a slump. i made myself clean the apartment yesterday, and i'm forcing myself to go to the gym today (even if it's just walking for a bit). i have an awesome husband and two wonderful cats...but i can't stop the looping negative rhetoric in my head about how i'm a useless sack of shit. i know i'm not a horrible person, people like me, etc. but i just hate myself. i hate my job. i hate my apartment. i hate that i have no idea where i'm going in life. i hate that i don't contribute more to others. i hate the way i talk and sometimes the inflections in my voice make people think i'm feeling differently than i am. i hate that i'm so angry. i hate that i hate myself.depression is comfortable and sometimes i'd rather just stop my meds and embrace it, only to eventually kill myself off. i feel like the meds are only barely holding back the flood gates. i don't know who i am anymore with out the full load. i don't know how to learn to be a new me. i don't know how to be genuinely happy. i don't know if i want to put in all that work.i want to go hide in my corner in the closet with a ton of booze and just get hammered. at least i'm happy when i'm drunk.edit: it gets worse at work cause it's usually slow and i just sit and think about shitty stuff or surf reddit and feel like i wasted 8 hrs of my life.

does anyone else go into their closet when they’re depressed?

need to reach out?

life is so much brighter when you are not depressed. i am able to be present and enjoy stuff so much more now.

i have knifes

no one
do you ever feel like you want someone to talk to but no one has a genuine connection? it’s all shallow and superficial? i want someone to ask am i okay without the expectation that i will say yes because it’s polite. i’m not okay. 
something that's helped me a lot
i would like to share something with everyone that has made a world of difference for me. please pardon if you've seen my post in another thread, i've posted this as much as i could.this is for those days that aren't impossible btw. fake it to create it. fake being happy and joyful over something. it's as simple as that. it feels cheap when i do it as if i'm lying to myself but i do it anyways. i do it with the intention the feeling of joy is the key to suppressing depression and fixing the way i see and feel. and it is. we have a tendency to expect joy to come to us when it's justified. that won't happen when living with depression. things that should make you joyful won't. it will never come. use joy like a tool. be wise about the situation and fake being joyful over things for the sake of fixing the way you see and feel.it takes a few times of doing it over and over before it catches on but it always does (unless it's a completely impossible day which i hardly have anymore). this might be hard to grasp the concept of but just try it.use energy and excitement to create the feeling of joy. you can be joyful over nothing if you want to by just creating the feeling.about a year ago my depression was terrible. and i had it for years before that. it was life stopping. it completely consumed me. my world was completely different. depression creates a lying world that seems so true and real. the way i see and feel now is completely different. the depression wouldn't let me be joyful about anything so i broke the rules.
my girlfriend has depression because her mind can't stop overthinking and reminding her that none of this matters, how can i help her?
whenever she goes and tries to enjoy something, she can't. her mind always reminds her that this doesn't matter and that happiness is temporary. that we are nothing in this vast universe. she wishes she could realize this and just go live life, like many people can, almost wishes she could say fuck it, i'm just gonna enjoy the time i have here but she can't.what can i do to help her? she's had many suicidal thoughts lately and says her thoughts are really consuming her. 
depression & chronic back pain are connected. here's what to do for those suffering.

i did it!
yesterday morning i woke up in one of the worst pain attacks ever. i then decided to look up any crisis clinics to see me immediately, because i hadn't been feeling safe. with 30 minutes to spare before closing and a few miles to walk i booked it and happened to make it just in time. there, i met with a physiatrist and was able to be put on several medications for depression, anxiety, and sleep. they also had a therapist on hand to speak with and other helpful programs. i'm very proud to of myself for stop making excuses and seeing someone. hopefully this works out. stay strong everyone. 
if you're feeling down, get back to nature.

don’t ask “what do i want to do?” ask “what would help make me feel a bit better?”
if you have that feeling where nothing seems to feel interesting, important, or desirable, i would recommend mentally asking the question “what would make me feel better?” rather than the question that is likely going through your head: “what do i want to do?”the answer to “what do i want to do” is very often “i don’t know / nothing.” it doesn’t move you forward productively. but if you ask “what would help make me feel better” you will likely come up with a few reasons (perhaps, “work out” or “take a shower”). now, you may not want to do any of these things, of course, but at least you’ve identified tangible goals that you estimate will improve your mood somewhat. having a goal is a lot better than being completely confused on how to feel better in any way. and while this may not seem like much, compare it to what you got out of asking “what do i want to do,” in which case you solved absolutely nothing and basically just went into a thought circle of “what do i want to do?? nothing... hmmm (*procrastinate*). what do i want to do?? nothing.... hmmm (*procrastinate*)... etc etc remember the question is “what will help me feel better,” this isn’t meant to be a cure. it’s just identifying and remembering things that improved your mood, however slightly, in the past - so that you can rationally consider whether to use those tools now. often times you will find that you’re just forgetting about small things that will help improve your mood somewhat (for example, forgetting to shower).
i feel like my brain is rotting
it’s been hard to do much lately, i just get sad and/or overwhelmed. i am failing my classes at college and i am having a hard time talking those closest to me about my problems, because it’s my fault. i have been struggling to take my meds, take care of myself, enjoy life, find purpose in my existence and such. i try to do work but i just get sad and break down or get my mind twisted in a knot and have to take way too many breaks. i can’t stop thinking about the past and what i have gone through. i feel like i should be better since i was hospitalized more than a year ago. i don’t know if my depression is severe or what. i am on high dosages of 2 antidepressants and an antipsychotic.every day i feel like i fall further into the hole that i am in. i frequently have serious suicidal thoughts and fantasize about how much better it would be if i didn’t exist. the only things i find pleasure in do not involve being a productive member of society. i don’t see a happy future for myself. the happy future i want is unobtainable.
this never happened to me before i'm freaking out

i am hurting
i've suffered for years, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and most likely adhd.i've tried to commit 3 times. thinking about a 4th and final. last time was 2 years ago. i was found by police and put in a mental health ward for 2 months. when i got out i met someone, managed to cope without medication because it never worked. it was great. i thought about karma how things have to be bad to get the good. thats what kept me going. 2 months ago it all came back, worse than ever, except i had someone to support me. or so i thought. i broke up with her last week, because she didnt understand. i could never talk to her about my feelings so when i needed to the most, i couldnt. now i have no one to support me. parents and siblings dont understand. i lost all of my friends that i thought i had. i've got no one to talk to. i've gone to councelling, ive got a referal to a shrink. its not going to be enough this time. why should it. no one cares. to them im not someone to care about theres always more people than just me going though it. least they have people that care though. family, friends, that understand. everything that im doing, to try and get better is for me alone. they dont care if i do. i feel nothing anymore. all of my emotions are gone. yet i feel every single one. anger, regret, guilt, sadness, depression. all of them i feel, yet i dont. i want it all to be over.
going through a tough time with food
i'm struggling right now pretty bad with my depression and i need some advice from anyone who has gone through this themselves. i have been eating a lot because of my depression and anxiety and i don't know how to control myself. i'm constantly mindlessly eating and i've gained weight because of this and it is making feel even worse than i already do. i don't know how i can stop eating when i'm not hungry to feel better about myself and then hopefully be able to workout and eat healthier to improve my depression.
went to the doctor today
it was really hard for me to reach out for help, but i couldn’t take it anymore. so i talked to my parents and they made me an appointment with the family doctor. i went and talked with him about how i am feeling and he gave me 37.5 mg dosage of venlafaxine. if anyone has tried this and has feedback it’d be very appreciated.
i am afraid.
i'm losing control. horribly depressed and getting reckless. i'm experiencing constant intrusive thoughts of suicide and it's fucking terrifying. honestly afraid that i'm losing my mind. i can't keep going like this but i don't know what to do. i've been living with this for most of my life and it's so terrible right now. i don't know where to start
fantasying about my death makes me feel less anxious.
today while straightening my hair i was playing through scenarios of my suicide and if my attempts work and for some reason it was comforting and i was a lot less anxious than i was before 
need help finding a reason to do anything.
i’m feeling like life is without purpose. i go to work, take care of my kids (although i definitely don’t feel like the super dad i once was), cook, clean etc.  my girlfriend and i bought a really nice house in a nice neighborhood. we have 5 kids between the two of us. we’re not rich but we don’t worry about making ends meet and can go on trips a few times a year. i know i am lucky to have a family and my life in general but i don’t feel like life has a purpose. i used to run a lot and then i got hurt. it was a really good thing for me mentally. i’m mostly better now and i do feel better when i do it but i have trouble motivating myself to do it. when i sit around and think about it i feel like it’s just a pointless hobby kind of like everything else. i’m 40yrs old and i just don’t care about much of anything. my kids would be on without me. i don’t give them anything my parents couldn’t give them. my job as a nurse is nice but i don’t think i’m anything special at doing my job. life would and will go on without me without skipping a beat. and that’s fine. i’ve always thought that even when in a good place. i think we hide in our day to day lives and we try to find something to occupy our mind. sometimes it’s a good hobby like running and sometimes it’s watching tv, cooking or any of the other millions of things. i think maybe i can get back to that point of being happy in the moment but i feel like i’m in a mental trap where i just don’t care because i don’t see the value in anything. i’ve reached out to a couple counselors today and will see someone soon hopefully, but does anyone have any specific advice for things that helped you get over the hump and back into life and finding meaning in it?  thanks for taking the time to read. i appreciate it!
[trigger warning] to all those who may want to quit.
hello you,  right now you might be any age. maybe you're 16, or 43. this may be the first time you've felt like you just wanted to give up on life, or maybe you've felt like this for years. maybe you don't see any light at the end of the tunnel, and maybe it seems more like a pit. however, i'm here to tell you that there is always an exit to the tunnel, and always another side to the pit.  at 10 years old i took most of a bottle of ibuprofen and went to sleep. i still woke up the next day. at 12 i tried again, and again 14 in many different ways. i've been in an out of psych hospitals and on more meds with more diagnoses than i care to even recall. i made a promise to myself i'd be dead by 16. well, surprise me! i'm about to be 30!   no, every day is not butterflies and sunshine. chaos comes to play in all of ours lives. but, here's what's happened in my life since the time i was supposed to die.  \- graduated high school having completed 10 art classes and having my art displayed in art shows as well as the state capital  building.   \- met my husband grabbing coffee at random one day. i never drank coffee, but that day for some reason i did, met a handsome barista and... the rest is history.  \- signed up homeless people to receive their social security cards and other documents, standing in the winter cold.\- taught two special ed. students how to add and subtract after they had been passed up the chain of people not caring. but they gained a year and a half of education level in the 6 months i had them. \- created and facilitated: a food drive for the homeless, computer lessons for children in a poverty stricken area, and a spring break program to help keep kids safe during school break in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the city.   \- helped both my mother and my father recover from catastrophic health issues (mom had a triple bypass, dad had kidney failure)  \- created two new lives, nurtured them inside my body, gave birth to them, and give them love every single day.  if i had killed myself at 16... none of these things would have been possible. you have and can have more of an impact in the world than you know. maybe you can't see things clearly right now... maybe there's fog in front of you. but there could be some very, very good things behind that fog.   take care of yourself. 
i’m only alive for my children.
i am sorry if this is a bit rambling, my thoughts have not been coherent for a while. my wife and i split three months ago due to my depression. up until 2 and a half weeks ago i had been spiralling  down toward rock bottom with the assistance of alcohol and the occasional drug usage. up until this point i had never been an alcoholic or addict, but i was growing dangerously close. i did not even start using drugs until the split. i saw my children as much as i could, 2-3 times a week, but the rest of my time was spent under some kind of influence, floating from couch to couch. 2 and a half weeks ago i hit the bottom. i am still not entirely sure what happened that night, but it involved a lot of booze and drugs, and a massive blow up between myself and my oldest friend, and then a night in hospital. the next morning i went to the last person that could help me, my cousin. she was firm and understanding with me. she spent a week helping me get on my feet, and found someone willing to let me rent their house. i moved in a week and a half ago, and have been sober 2 weeks. i finally have somewhere i can call a home, a place to spend time with my kids. but i am not really happy. i love my kids, i love being with my kids. i am only happy with them. but i feel i have failed them. i still love my wife, and i realise i had been taking her for granted. but due to how i have handled my depression, i have caused too much damage for her to want to continue together. when my kids are with me, i feel ok. but when they leave, i am empty. all i want to do when they leave is go and get a bottle to numb myself. i don’t know how long i can last. the only thing stopping me is the fact that i do not want to jeopardise time with my kids, but i am scared that this emptiness will end up taking me. i would never do anything to hurt them, they are my whole world. honestly, if i did not have them, i would not be here. 
i have no friends, what can i do on a friday as it’s basically the weekend now? only thing i can think of is the gym which i hate.

increasingly suicidal
i’ve been dealing with depression my whole life. but recently it’s gotten worse. i think about moving far away and killing my self a couple times a week now. followed by a week or two of being happy or like a positive existentialist. i honestly think that i would have killed myself by now, but i would never put my family and my little brother specifically through that. i don’t really have any passions, i used to. i don’t know what i want to do with my life, it’s been years and i still haven’t figured that one out. but i’m only 19. ik i’m young. but i’m gonna die alone and the only reason i’m here is my family. i don’t really know why i’m posting this. maybe i just want to get the words off of my chest and somewhere. i’ve only told one person the way i really feel besides this. idk. it’s getting harder and harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
i just let loose and started dancing, a girl upended a drink over my head and everyone laughed.
i’m now sitting alone at at a table, no one cares
cannabis significantly reduces depression, anxiety, and stress

been feeling this way all my life

having treated people with depression over the past 7 years, i wanted to post a short video answering the commonest questions that i get asked about antidepressants. please comment below about your experiences and let me know if i have missed anything in the video. many thanks dr varun

i am observably getting better!
two years ago i gave up on pretty much everything. i quit going to any of my engineering classes, i spent hours prepping for my decided suicide method just waiting for it all to be over. i stopped cleaning myself and brushing my teeth. i avoided all human contact. i dropped out of school/was kicked out. i spent a year at home working and doing decently well. i have a strong support system. i decided after a year i was ready to get back out there. i intended to go back to school that year, but i wound up just burning through my savings and being lazy. i got back to planning a suicide attempt, started taking care of myself less again, etc. after a year, i ended a crappy relationship that i was in for half of my depression. i moved out and got into school for music. i just noticed last night that i've been regularly brushing my teeth and showering without prompting for the past few weeks. i'm motivated to do my homework and clean my place and practice for hours a night. i realized this morning that i haven't considered suicide in like 5 or 6 months. i think i'm gonna make it guys! i know that it is hard to find hope guys. but it's there. you can all make it. i hope this helps someone somehow. 
i keep myself alive so those around me don't suffer the grief.
my biggest issue of late is life just seems pointless to continue, but i don't have the courage in lack of better words to end it. i just stay alive to not put others through that type of pain because of guilt issues, among other reasons.i am 28, 29 in two months, unemployed, associates degree in liberal arts (waste of my time and money), and live at home since i wasted all the money i ever earned pretty much. now i know i could turn my life around (probably) but i don't know where to start. it's going to take so many years to make/save enough to support myself and either due to one of my mental conditions (major depression, general and social anxiety disorder are diagnosed, but recently i've gotten to where i rarely leave my house one or twice a month, have paranoid delusions, and struggle to see s point in living in the system that we have no choice but to play. (my old therapist would say excuses i can hear her now, heh)i've had drug problems for years now, although they've gotten tamer over the years. i am pretty sure amphetamines caused the paranoia and a in lack of better phrasing 'craziness'. i will generally finish s bottle equalling 1200mg in two-three weeks, suffer, maybe take some benzos if i have spares but that's rarer these days because i've sadly abused them more the i had been (once or twice a week now) because of the loneliness since my best friend overdosed in february.what's fucked up is i'm aware i'm doing what not to do, but just can't find a reason to care, in all likeliness i won't lead a great life even if i do manage to start functioning in society again. i basically gave up dating since i basically go completely dumb around women and either won't talk of trip over my words. i'm not successful anyways besides i guess at being a drug addict and i'm broke so why would anyone want me anyways. even when i wasn't using years ago i have yet to have an actual girlfriend although i've had sex, which was kind of a let down knowing they are going to forget about me within a day. i see myself living in a low income area barely scraping by and if i could afford it probably move on to heroin or something (was an opiate addict for a while so i know what i'm signing up for with that), i mean right now i don't intend to, but if i'm alone the rest of my life with my friends dying or growing apart because they figured out this whole adulthood thing, combined with a shitty job i hate, why not? sorry for the rant and the illogical and stupid comments in this post. i just don't really know who to talk to, and even worse, i can't afford good help plus i feel so defeated i don't even know if i care anymore, although i must somewhat if i'm still alive. i really miss my friend, he was the only person who shared most if not all my conditions and he was like my little brother. my current friends are seeming to be more responsible and make good life decisions and all my stories are about debauchery and bad decisions. sometimes i don't know what to talk about anymore. i'd love a romantic partner but i don't see it happening, especially since i rarely go anywhere or try at all.tldr: i've reached a point where my depression is almost apathy, i see no point in living this horrible incurable existence just for other people, but i love them too much to off myself. so i sit here in limbo just taking it each day at a time and lying to myself along with self medicating with marijuana (at least), amphetamines or benzos depending on what i have currently. i don't see a point in getting clean, i feel i fucked up so much that it's stupid to try, and romantically no woman would possibly want me due to my substance abuse, mental instability, and general lack of any type of financial security. what's the fucking point anymore?
rearrange your room right now
guys, this might sound as something silly, but something i have done a couple of times to help me up against depression, is to rearrange your room. by this, i mean to move the bed to another place, the desk to a new location, etc. it gets you up to do things, and sets you a new scenery- and while you reorganize you could clean up a bit as well if you feel like it. i did this today and worked like a charm, i organized my things, cleaned up, did the laundry and so on.please share your thoughts about this.
hi i'm depressed and unmotivated
story of my life. bye.
i feel absolutely alone..
my dad killed himself wile i was pregnant in october of '17 after some drama happened between the two of us.since then i've been suffering yall... i have friends who dont call, dont check up.. they don't come through for my birthday when i finally get a night away from the baby... they dont answer when i need them... like now.. my family just the same... they honestly just anger me. they say i'm doing it for attention or to be a bitch.. but they dont realize i'm so damn close to the edge.. the only thing keeping me grounded is my kid. but even i feel like she would be better off without me, which, i do know is stupid ( not the best, but definitely not the worst mom). any way.. sometimes i grab my keys and wallet and i just...i just want to run. where? i dont know.. somewhere with peace? how long? forever? just until i feel normal again? i honestly dont think that's possible. do i bring the baby? leave her?i just want a friend.. to unload all this on to. who i can call and they tell me its gunna be okay to come over and have a girls night in.. to just sit down and drink coffee.. i'm lost..confused hurt broken alone suffocating..
check out my video explaining my story of depression i currently am going through.❤

everyday i think about you
on the drive to school i listen to music everyday. i sit in the passengers seat and watch the trees and the buildings go by. i see other cars and other people on there way to work. occasionally, i see a person walking along the sidewalk. the kids in the back talk and joke. the van driver listens to the rock and roll radio station. i sit and listen to my music. i do this in any car, train, and van ride. some people want me to talk instead of listening to music. some people wish i didn’t always have my headphones in. some people think i’m just ignoring them. but i’m not. i never ignore anybody. as i sit in the van, i think about the people in there cars. i wonder if they are having a good day. i wonder if they are sad. i wonder if they are happy. i wish them well. i think about why the person is walking alone on the sidewalk. i wonder if they are sad. i wonder if they are alone. i wish them well.i go on this subreddit a lot. i see all the people trying to get help. i see all the hearts in need of mending. i wish i could sew the broken ones together again. i wish i could go to each person and help them. lend them a hand. give them a hug. but i’m a small girl in a large world. a thousand happy faces, but another sad face lost in the mist. the crowd is thickening and as i’m reaching out my hand, i’m pushed to the ground. that small voice in my head whispers, “your too young”. i can’t burden any more weight. but i’m still reaching out my hand, even though the voice grows louder saying “stop, your break!”. but i still reach out my hand. i can see the person in the center of the crowd. i can see them crying. i can see them suffering. i can see them being ignored. i see the the other people walking past. i run. i run and run and run. i push through the crowd of people who don’t understand. i shove past the people who say they do, then just ignore. i slam the people who say they love you then turn there back on you and leave you alone. i get to the person in the middle. there is nobody left in the crowd, i reach my hand down and touch the shoulder of the person. i don’t know them yet i know them so well. i’m afraid. i can feel everyone’s pain around me. it’s becoming my own. sitting in this room of mine, i’m hopeless. i don’t have answers. there is no way i can help. i always say the wrong thing. i always mess up.but i want to help. i want to help because i know what it’s like to suffer, i know what it’s like to be ignored. i know what it’s like to want to end.  but all i can do is this. i love you. no matter what faults you have or what background you have, i love you. i also forgive you. i forgive all the bad things you’ve done or the mistakes you’ve made. you are in my heart right now. i don’t know you and i probably never will, but you will forever be in my heart. keep going. please. i’m trying too keep going too, so let’s keep going together.
am i depressed or just overthinking?
im 15, and it all started 3 years ago, back then o used to live with my dad with my step mum and my half brothers and my mum as well, but my dad would tread me badly. he abused me physically, emotionally, and sexually. but i don’t want to go deeper into those parts. everyday after school he would always get mad at me for not ‘studying’ i mean i did get pretty wacky grades back then but still, how could i stay motivated if even my own father brings me down? he would hit me if i get the wrong answers and say bad stuff. i remember this one time when we had dinner, my step mum was there and we were all eating in silence, i could remember that day like it was yesterday. he asked me if i did my homework and i just didn’t answer, he then started yelling at me and he told that i don’t deserve anything good in this world. i didn’t know what to do that time, i sat there crying in the dinner table while my step mum looked at me with pity. she couldn’t do anything and that’s alright, i understood why. after dinner i ran to my room and i started cutting that day. after a few months my mum, brother, and i went back to my mums home country, i thought everything would be fine by then but i was wrong, 2 years ago i had no friends. i was lonely as heck. i have nobody to talk to. nobody to vent out to. last year i got some friends, but they weren’t the friends i really wanted. they kind of treated me like shit. and my aunt always gets mad at me for no reason, she tells me to go back to my father and it triggers me every time. she doesn’t know what he did, and maybe if she did, will she change? a few days ago i had a huge fight with her. i cried and told her how i felt with the way she was treating me. but she didn’t care.
i'm ruining my own life but i can't stop.
i'm 20 and in my junior year of college. i was re-diagnosed this year with dysthymia (used to be major depression) and started prozac, which basically just gave me mild side effects and didn't help at all. i switched to wellbutrin and didn't even have any side effects, i felt like i was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didn't help at all. i start effexor tomorrow and am setting up counseling, but i'm literally ruining my life right now.in past semesters, i was able to scrape through with a b average and go to most of my classes. that's not the case anymore. i'm not getting out of bed until the sun goes down, i'm skipping days of classes at a time, i have no idea what any of my grades are - and the worst part is that i can't even bring myself to care. somewhere in the back of my mind i know that if i fail this semester i'm going to majorly fuck up my financial aid and won't graduate on time, but it just doesn't matter to me. i'm too tired to care.i barely wake up in time for work most days, and i'm having to make excuses for being late all the time. i don't cook, so i don't eat. i don't clean, so my room and kitchen are disgusting. i don't even know what homework assignments i need to catch up on. i'm exhausted all the time. i'm too tired to even read over this before posting, so sorry in advance if none of it makes sense.basically i'm halfway through this semester and i'm pretty sure i'm going to fail all of my classes, ruin my financial aid, get fired from my job, get written up by housing (i live on campus), and i'm worried about what i might do to myself if this all happens. i don't know what i'm supposed to do. i don't know how to make myself care. i don't know how to get motivated to get out of bed in the morning. i will accept literally any advice from anyone. please help.edit 12/22/19: wow, looking back on this post makes me realize what a deep hole i was in. thank you to everyone who commented, either with advice or just chiming in with their experiences. i’m really proud to say that i passed the semester (with straight c’s but still) and have started therapy. effexor has started working. i’m in a better place than i have been in a long time. yeah, i’m still struggling with motivation and i’m looking into whether i may have undiagnosed adhd, but i made it through a situation that previously felt hopeless. idk. if you’re looking for a sign that things can get better, here it is.
i want to stop existing for a bit
lately i’ve been feeling like i have absolutely nobody to talk to besides my therapist, and i only see her twice a month.since my fall break has ended, everyone including myself has gone back to school and i’m finding myself completely alone again. i have tried making new friends on campus but it just hasn’t worked out since i live at home and not there.my family has been... less than supportive, going as far as to tell me to just live with someone else. it’s been difficult to tell them any of my anxieties or issues going on without it being blown out of proportion and being told i’m not good enough.last week when i told my mom how some of the things she says and does to me make me feel worthless or insignificant and she defended herself with all the amazing things she’s done for me and how nobody respects her either so i shouldn’t complain because my life is perfect. keep in mind she’s speaking to a recovering alcoholic, coke addict, and university dropout.my life is far from perfect.i apologize for the wall of text, i just need to vent since i can’t vent to my therapist until next week, i have made a lot of progress and i just wish the people around me would see how much i am working and fighting against my depression and anxiety to make people happy. i’m starting to slip in grades and getting back into old habits and i just need it to all slow down for a second.
i am lost at 49
hello, i came here to seek help or at least to know that i am not alone in this journey. i think i did well in terms of my career. after i graduated from college, i worked as a graphic designer then i self-study to become a flash animator and game designer. from then i became a web designer to a web developer to mobile ui designer and wordpress theme developer. so as you can see, i had the motivation to improve myself and my career.this loss of interest started last year in my last job. i no longer have the patience for office politics, my co-workers have this employee mentality, and if i do not join their club they will make things difficult for you since our work is connected to each other. the commute is hard too, it's 2 hours going to work and 2 hours going back not because of the distance, but the traffic is heavy, i work 9-5. i left my job to give time for myself because i feel so burnt out and this is the first time i had a chronic fatigue. i still do some freelance (work from home) and this lessens my stress of commuting and dealing with toxic people.i am single and i am thinking that could this also be contributing to my problem. the last relationship i had was 3 years ago and it is good that it ended because i was with a narcissist, actually, i didn't know that until i went to counseling. so good riddance. i did not look for a new relationship because i like the peace i had after the breakup. i was able to focus on my own needs instead of the other.i spent my single life studying psychology and philosophy and i get to learn more about what's wrong with me and the myth i was living. if you are curious, i am reading nietzche, jung, joseph campbell, stoicism, etc. it helped me understand about the human mind but it also makes me don't want to go back to 9-5 rat race.so i am lost, i need to find a new stable job soon to survive, but i am having anxiety that by the time i hit the big 50 my chance of getting employed will go down. i will be working with people much younger than me and will have a generation gap. i already experienced this two years ago, the younger generation (20's) co-workers were so pc (politically correct) and don't have respect for the wisdom of the ages. they were also commenting on my white hair. i am proud of my white hair because i earned it. but having to work with shallow people can be frustrating sometimes. i'm not saying all young people in general, this only applies to my former workplace, unfortunately.i recently enrolled in java android development because i want to do software engineering. i have experience designing ui for different mobile devices and i think it's time to go beyond pushing pixels and learn the backend. but all these issues i mentioned above are holding me back. for the first time, i do not have the motivation i used to have before, i hope this only temporary. i like to learn but something inside me doesn't want to and it is winning so far.so what shall i do now? i do not know what road will i take because i will wake up in the morning with no desire to study and look for work, although i know i have to.i am hoping to see answers from people who've been into my situation, especially someone over 50.my situation reminds me of the conversation between george constanza and kramer of seinfeld: [https://youtu.be/waokrfqsdum](https://youtu.be/waokrfqsdum)i am lost at 49. can't think of a new goal, can't find motivation. please help.
hey, you! this is for you.
friend, you are not alone.i've been struggling with depression most of my life, even had some suicidal ideologies. i wish there was some pithy quote i could share from my own counseling that would flip a switch for you and make it all better, but it doesn't work that way. i'm writing this as much for myself, right now, as i am for you.that voice in your head playing on repeat, telling you things will never get better? that tightness in your chest that feels like your heart is slowly being crushed within you? they're lies. maybe it's a chemical imbalance, maybe it's something else, but it's not the truth. you may not be able to will the darkness away, but you can recognize it for what it is and stand up to it.you are not a prisoner in your own life! you have agency; you have within you the ability to overcome. there will be wins, and there will be losses - learn from both and know that you are just that much stronger today than you were yesterday.you've been dealt a crappy hand, but you get to decide how the story goes from here on (sorry for mixing metaphors).you have value, you have worth and while you may not feel like it - forgive me if i get too preachy here - god loves you so much, even in your darkest hour, that he was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for you. you are that special.the world is brighter place with you in it. your strength and your fortitude may go unnoticed by all the unburdened folk out there - but i know how strong you really are, and it's inspiring.
lost in a rabbit hole @_@
hi, i'm 23 years old and i tend to feel like i'm wasting time. i stopped going to college at the end of 2017, i didn't go back for the fall semester. i found two pretty good jobs until they both laid me off, due to the fact that they were only seasonal. after that i havent felt like filling out applications, instead i've been pursuing my dream job. i want to be a journalist and lately i've been so far down the rabbit hole of story writing i feel like i nearly lost touch with reality. i know in order to learn you have to fail over and over and that's how i feel. at the same time i feel like i've been spending way too much time writing and researching i forgot when the last time i talked to another human being. im not that close to my family and i only have a couple friends, who seem to be busy most of the time.when i'm not obsessing over writing i catch myself day dreaming about a perfect world where i go out on the weekends and have fun. i have never really experienced that and the thought makes me feel alone or that this humanity. people are just words on a screen now.if anyone has any tips please let me know!

walking depression
i think i have walking depression.  i'm not happy in anything i do. i've no interest in relationships and feel as if i'm going nowhere in life. i  feel disconnected and i just want to stop 
i want to die. i cannot do this anymore. i guess the giant won in my case. i hate being unreliable. i hate being like this *a pile of shitty lard*.

i beg of you
listen to me.there’s so many people in pain and wanting to give up.who thinks their life isn’t worth it.it is.i know that you’re probably like yeah whatever i’ve heard that before but i’ve been there.five years ago i was homeless in the middle of phoenix arizona and i have had attempted to try to be a prostitute and i did it once and afterwords i decided that i would rather sit down and just give up then ever do that again. my whole life has been one hardship after another my parents met at a drug house my mom use my dad as a place to stay.. i can remember at three years old walking down the stairs and seeing beat them beat the crap out of each other. when i was five my parents divorce and for a year i begged to go live with my dad. my mom let me go in when i was a meth lab in the house. my grandfather i don’t know would’ve came with me. he called my mom and i move back in with her and i haven’t really seen much since of my dad. my mom was an alcoholic and she bartender and she did it different guys when i was growing up i took care of my little brother from age seven until i was a teenager like he was mine. it was a constant struggle i would have to support her emotionally when she should’ve been supporting me.my first boyfriend cheated on me when i was in eighth grade which doesn’t seem like a big deal anymore but at the time that was you i trusted the most and it made me have trust issues. as i got older my mom and the person she married would beat me and throw me against the tv takeoff that her closet door and throw it across the room and anger. when i was 16 i went to go see my grandfather again who was across the country and i went there expecting to come back at the end of summer and i didn’t and it up sleeping on my grandmothers couch because i realize what a relief it was not being with my mother anymore. being on my own i of course made some decisions that i can regret. when i was 16 i got pregnant with this boy who i thought i loved.he did drugs and i didn’t know what to do i was so sick trying to be near him the smoke would make me sick to my stomach.he didn’t step up as a father and as a 16-year-old would you have a job or anything else i went back to my mothers house. when i went back she forced me to get an abortion. this is still one of the most regrettable moments of my life. i developed postramantic stress disorder and i couldn’t look at myself in the mirror i cut all my hair off and i cut all my friends out.my great grandparents who live nearby and thought that i just lost my mind or something and i was an allowed to talk about it i wasn’t going to mention my baby and i would have nightmares every night.when the person i was with found out he attempted to kill himself and he was in a coma for three weeks and they told me that he wasn’t gonna make it out and it was my fault.he did make it out but his brain was never the same and both of us didn’t recover. we both got messed up mentally from it. i couldn’t get my mom knowing what had happened and not being able to speak about it or crying about it. so i want to go live with my biological dad who i hadn’t seen since i was seven the one who had a meth lab in this house.i went up to stay with him and within a week i had to call the cops on him because he was getting drunk and i was scared. he threw the tv across the room and ripped the phone out of the wall when i was calling the police screaming at me calling me a murder saying that i was just like my mother and that i would never be happy. he told me that he was going to go out and kill himself and left. when the police showed up i was crying and they didn’t do anything. i got a hold of friends i had back in phoenix arizona and they got me a greyhound take it and i ran away. i still have really bad ptsd and we have nightmares looking at myself. i tried going back to the person i was with and we were both messed up nicely for me work out in the last thing he told me was that he wanted to kill me. i loved him it’s the hardest thing  to hear someone you love tell you they want to kill you. it is one of the hardest things you’ll ever hear. i want to go stay back with my grandfather again but he got into an old folks home and i love him so i let him do that i need one holding back because i was going through things. i ended up being homeless and hungry so i would occasionally take things from the walmart deli chicken or macaroni and cheese to eat. i want point i tried selling my body for money because i was so hungry. after i did that once i hated myself even more and i decided that i should just sit down somewhere and let myself cry until i die.that’s not the way life works.i ran into my first born of three kids “father” on the second day that i was doing that and they offered me him and his friends offered me a place to stay so i slept on the floor in a dirty studio with a bunch of homeless people. it smelled like cat p and there was people there. there must’ve been 12 people in the studio. i didn’t feel alone anymore though. developing feelings for the person who i first started talking to. overtime though he became abusive he was controlling manipulative he would physically sexually exploited me but i feel i deserved it. so i never stopped it.one day i ran to an old friend i knew when i first moved to phoenix and i realized how bad of a situation i was really in. that night he choked me until i blacked out. when i woke up i called the police and while i was on the phone he threatened to kill himself with a knife and i was just crying begging him to not to kill himself because i really felt like i had too much blood on my hands.i cradled the phone like it was my lifeline. when the cops got there they took pictures of my bruises and a statement of what happened and what had been happening. they never arrested him or anything.they took me to this facility so they could check me out mentally because he made me black out and physically because of my bruises.they did a mandatory pregnancy test and i was pregnant.i went to the gymnastic a few shelter in shock not knowing what i was going to do i don’t have any money i wasn’t working i didn’t know anything about babies.i decided that i was going to do whatever it took because even if i didn’t feel like i deserve better iife the baby did though. it had never done anything wrong.i went to a catholic place and i learned about being a mother and loving myself again. i am by no means catholic and do not consider myself religious really just spiritual. i believe that something whether it was fate or a walk or a divine person out there helps me out of my darkness.four years later it was not easy but i manage. her biological father is not on the birth certificate because he was abusive. he could’ve made me lose her. that’s right her,my daughter.her middle name is amaris which means a you are loved in latin.in the last three years i’ve been blessed to find a man if you really cared for me. he loves me and my daughter who he is legally adopted now. and we’ve had two more kids. two boys. so every day i get to wake up to smile’s and to people who love me unconditionally. i think that’s worth every moment of heartbreak. every moment of sadness depression. so i’m begging you don’t give up yet because you may be in the darkness for a long timebut i really do believe that you’ll make it out into the light eventually. please just hold on.
is it best to close off everyone and start over?

my choices ruined my life.
i'm new here and just wanted to get this out in the open somewhere.  i've been depressed as long as i can remember and it feels like i should just give up at 25.  i was the black sheep of my family, with a brother and sister who love and talk to each other all the time, a dad who's heart i don't want to break and a mother i loath for being a terrible mother.... i don't think any of them know what i'm going through and i don't feel comfortable around them.  i made terrible choices when i was young and it has effected my life and future severely.  i dropped out of college, quit good jobs, ruined friendships, and subsequently my life.  i can't talk to people.  i can't look them in the eyes.  i don't trust anyone because it seems like there's an aura around me that makes people hate me.  i wouldn't blame them.  i hate me too.   i have an irrational fear of talking on the phone, which makes it impossible to even find a new job. i've been a shut in for a year now and as much as i want to change for the better it feel like there's an invisible wall trapping me in home.which isn't even my home anymore because my so of 8 years told me he doesn't love me anymore.i'm shattered with no where to go, no one to go to.  
10 years living with depression, i feel like a sociopath now....
i am at the point of no return. i feel alone ,abandoned, and i don’t know where to turn. i was diagnosed with severe depression when i was 13 put on meds and nothing has changed. i have changed meds three times, seen therapist which i can’t stand. i lost my two beat friends in a car accident two years ago, along with my brother in law he died two years ago in my arms and i felt nothing. sometimes i feel so numb to pain and suffering i wonder if i am asociopath. i have attempted to take my life twice. i want something to tell me i’m worth living for because i feel so use less and alone. i feel no purpose in life. i just feel like giving up and i’m not sure where to turn. 
girlfriends depression suddenly became extremely bad at the drop of a hat, all her emotions are gone and she won't talk to anyone so can't figure out how to help. advice?
i'll be honest a lot of my friends have depression but i've never seen anything like this. we've been dating for about close to a year now and know each other for a year and a half. it's long distance but we've weathered it rather well. she's always had depression and has found talking to people difficult and draining but up in till recently she always said i was different saying she loved me couldn't wait to be together in person and crafting really personalised gifts for me all the while helping me with my own disabilities.her emotions where always on a seasaw for a good part of our start being in love to just not feeling it but feeling close to it. and i grew to accept how this was.suddenly though as if at a drop of a hat her emotions just died i'd say about a week ago she went from i love you to talking very little. putting down anything romantic i'd say and insulting me to the point where it hurt and not even say sorry which has never been like her. next she'd tell me how it's a drain to talk to me and too much effort to give me attention. that being said at this point i stopped starting our chats and only responding because i thought at these times she actually wanted to talk to me however she said that she still didn't want to talk to me or anyone but couldn't figure out why she always replied to me.i started to feel at a loss and admittedly bugged her with questions out of a mix of confusion and worry. what do you feel about me? do you want to break up? are we even friends anymore? to which i got no replies. but still occasional talks about other things untill she made it very clear that all she wants to do is be alone, watch bones and hang out with her adorable cats.at this point i thought if she wants space then i'll giver her what she wants and i made a deal that i'd not reply to anything from her till monday unless she really wanted to talk and in return she'd start writing a journal of her feelings (googleing depression help suggested it was a good idea and i'm way to far away to take her to see someone) tell me at least where we stand. promise to not ghost me, we'd have a video date next week and leave me a photo of her being in a long distance relationship photos are away of knowing they're still their.she agreed but didn't do any of the above so far. i tried to bring it up but she reminded me that we're not supposed to be talking and after being told i wouldn't be ghosted though having no answers on where i stand with here i went quite again.untill last night where i was sexually assaulted and i suddenly felt like i needed some comfort from a person who promised and always did comfort me. to which the only response was i talk a lot for someone who's not supposed to be talking i felt heartbroken and still do. finally the shock of assault flared up a spinal condition and i'm now in hospital for a few days. i messaged her telling her and that i'm okay because i don't know. maybe the her i knew is still their deep down and would want to know her partner is in hospital but nothing.i'm just at a weird loss to how this can happen in basically 10 days from i love you to completely ignoring your partners sexual assult and hospitalisation. is this normal for depression? does she not want me anymore? how can i help with her complete shut down of her personality and emotions? 
depression is a time thief

i know i'm not the only one
not expecting any comments or anything, but today is just one of those days where it really feels like a physical effort to speak, or communicate at all. like, it almost takes more effort than its worth. at least here, i won't be judged for being negative
i need some closure
this is a sub account. i'm writing this because i needed some form of closure. this is my life story thus far. my parent don't really like each other. i was born out of wedlock and kept a secret from my extended family almost a year. when everything came clean, my parents married because of me but continued to stay apart. i stayed with my mother. when i was 4, i met my father for the first time. i didn't know who he was to me. i didn't know how to greet him so i asked my mother. she told me that he's my father and i should greet him likewise. i did but it didn't feel right. i didn't know i had a father. i didn't have a relationship with this man and he suddenly went from being a stranger to what was supposedly the most important man in my life. my mother told me we were going to live together now. my mother and i are going to move in with my father and his parents. when i asked my mother why she made that choice later in life, her reply was that she wanted me to have a proper family. she didn't want me to live life without a father. we moved in, things were okay. i had to leave my old life behind. life with my maternal grandparents and cousins were gone in an instance. but i met my paternal grandparents and cousins for the first time. when i was 5, my paternal cousin questioned my lack of education. i didn't speak english very well and didn't really have a wide range of vocabulary. her parents are graduates and my mother wasn't. my father at this point had not taken much part in my education. i only get to see him every other day. when i was 6, i lost interest in cartoons. i liked watching documentaries. my classmates found me weird. my parents thinks i'm watching too much television so i began to read. when i was 8, my love for science was out of the roof. i was reading encyclopedias because i like them. although i didn't understand everything, i did try my best to. i told my parents one fine day that i wanted to study about the stars and the galaxy. my mother scoffed. my father laughed. i asked them why, what what was wrong with wanting to study the universe. they told me i was too young to think about it and i should focus on my studies. later that year, when my teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grow up, i didn't have an answer. i submitted a blank paper. from then on, i hated that question. when i was 9, my life was thrown into chaos.first off, my mother moved out. she and my dad had been fighting very often for the past few years. she realised it wasn't going to work out for her. she got a job near to where her parents lived so she moved back to stay with them. i stayed behind. she told me it was because i would have a better environment with my father. his side of the family was educated unlike my mother's. she would come back and visit me once every week at first. then it grew sparse. with in the next year, i would only get to see her on long holidays. secondly, my grades were falling. i did extraordinarily well for math and science. so much so that i went for a gifted course for both of them. but i neglected my other studies. particularly my languages. don't get me wrong, i didn't fail them. i just didn't do really well, scoring cs. it didn't help that my cousins were scoring as or high bs. i was compared to by everybody. why couldn't you be like her? why aren't you better at studying? studying is your only job as a student. why can't you do it well? those are the common words that were thrown around. my merits were not important. my failures were highlighted. what's worse, i don't usually hand up homework for any of my subject, especially math and science. they didn't help me so i never thought of them as important. i fell asleep in class quite often as well. i had already learnt what my teachers were teaching. i understood them without much effort and was really bored in class. my teachers often called my parents to complain about my behaviour in class. more often than not, it was my mother. now, my mother's new job requires her to work late into the night. because of this, she was often annoyed at my teacher waking her up with calls in the morning. she would channel her annoyance to me, reprimanding me with no reason other than i don't want your teacher to call me. it was worse with my father. it went more than reprimanding for him. if he received calls, he would often hit my legs with the belt or slap me. it wasn't to the level of abuse, it wasn't repeatedly, often once or twice per incident. but it was bad enough.he also hates it when i cry. he would say that i'm old enough to accept the consequences of my actions and i shouldn't cry about it. i would get into more trouble if i were to cry so i've learnt to stop crying when i get hurt. instead, i would often cry myself to sleep at night. because of this, years after, i still get afraid hearing the phone ring. it was almost a reflex at some point that i will jump up in fear hearing the ring of a phone. it took me a long long time to get over that. this was the year i started to hate my life. i felt lost. i had no one, no friends in school and no one at home. i became suicidal. i was 9.when i was 10, my parents and i went on a trip together. it was a request from me because i came from a prestigious school and everyone had been on a plane but me. i wanted to try thinking that perhaps after this i could fit in for once. the trip was joyous and more than i could have asked for. when it was time to go home, i held on to my mother. i had miss not having her with me for the past year. i wanted her to come home with me. just for one night... i had school the next day so she couldn't find a reason to stay over. when she ask me why i wanted her to stay over i couldn't give an answer. at this point in life i was such an introvert that i was afraid of saying the wrong thing. i didn't dare to answer. so i did what i shouldn't. i cried. my father got really angry. he scolded me for being childish and slapped me in the middle of the airport. there were many onlookers and i was afraid of doing anything else. i just could not stop crying. my mother finally gave in and we went home together. dispite what had happened, i felt happy. this was also the year i started to lose my edge in science. it wasn't because i lost my interest in it. it was because i wanted to be normal. when i speak to my classmates about things that interest me, they would look at me like i have horns growing out of my head. they are more interested in toys and game while i was reading up on world history and wanted a microscope. i would watch mythbusters because i like to build things and even build some mini robot kit but my paternal grandmother would scoff at me and say that i was being very unlady like. that was something she often did. she was closer to my cousins because she knew them since they were babies. they were perfect and well behaved in her eyes while i was the weird one. girls should draw and play with dolls. i didn't like it. when i reject to play with my cousins my grandmother would call me ungrateful. she would point me out for distancing myself from the rest of them and blamed it on my upbringing. particularly saying that my mother didn't raise me right.i was sick of being outcasted. i wanted to be normal. i stopped trying too hard in things i enjoy. i started to read up about what other people enjoy so that we could have something to talk about. i stopped being so curious and asking too much question ( my father often deemed some of my questions as stupid questions. he said would say that i should focus one what the school is teaching) although i would still read alone in secret when i have the time to. things that i was good at, things that i love quickly dwindled down into normality. soon, i was the jack of all trades but master of none. i am neither here nor there. i cried more often than i should. in fact, i cried so much i became numb. i don't feel anything anymore. i started to believe what others had said. i'm not important. i'm weird. i don't fit in. i lost my thoughts because i was afraid of them. i started to think if anyone will miss me if i'm gone. i wondered about how good things would be if i didn't exist. my mother won't have a reason to stay with my father anymore and she could leave the marriage without any burden. i don't have to wake up and force myself to go to school and speak with someone i don't wish to. i was 10 when i pen down my suicide note. i said that i was stress with school and that i love my mother. i noted down that i just couldn't stand life anymore. i wrote it just in case i ever did it and hid it in a cupboard of my things. a place that no one will find unless they were clearing up my things. i was thinking that they would find it whiles packing my stuffs after i've passed on. but i never did it. i didn't dare to. i was afraid. i looked down the window and reprimanded myself time and time again. why couldn't you do it? you are a stupid and weak, you can't even die. i would tell myself that everytime and beat myself up over it. i scolded myself day after day and day after day for being completely useless. by the time i was 11-12, i am normal from the outside. i was quietly suffocating myself inside but it was fine. i slowly stopped reading. i began to make friends. my grades evened out. i wasn't scolded as much. i didn't really miss my mother anymore. but i didn't feel happy at all. i had completely lost who i was. i had no interest. i have nothing that makes me, me. i'm just a name and a face. i couldn't even decide on a favourite colour and had to have help from someone to choose. i don't remember much from this time but these are the few that i remember. there was day whereby we were suppose to do elearning from home. there is only one computer at my place and it is located in the living room. the computed is password protected and i had to call my father for the password. he refuse to give it to me in fear that i would abuse my rights to access the internet. instead, i had to wait for him to return home and complete my school work in the wee hours of the night with him watching me do it. when i was 12, i remember clearly that i was running fever in school. the teachers decided to call my father and send me home. i remember the first thing he said to me. are you sure you have a fever? are you faking it? i didn't know what to reply to that. i didn't know how to reply to that. it was these few years that i started to develop a morbid curiosity to thing. i embraced the weird side of me that no one understood. i was in love with the human anatomy and would read up on it whiles hidding in my room. i know now that there shouldn't be anything to hide but i was afraid that someone will think differently of me if they see it. i'm already anti-social, i don't want to be deemed a psychopath. the suicidal thoughts occurs less frequently but when they hit it was pretty intense. it was also around this time that i started to hurt myself. i had never cut because i didn't want it to be obvious. i didn't want people to realise i'm doing this so i hit and punch myself in the thighs when i'm upset. they hurt and leave bruises but those don't last long and could often be covered up with clothings. when i was 13 things changed for the better. i had to change a school so i chose one that was closed to my mother. i moved in with her despite the outrage of my father. i couldn't stand it anymore and i really needed a breather. i need to learn to be myself again. things aren't always smooth sailing from then on. for one thing, i had grew apart form my mother. we don't really know much about each other anymore. we fought over small disputes and didn't agree on a lot of thing. we lost the connection that we once had. i couldn't feel the comfort i was craving for. what's worse, my cousin just had a child around that time and my mother was close to him because they lived under the same roof. she played with him and read to them much like how she would when i was young. i could only look at them interacting with bittersweet jealousy of what i could have had. when i moved in with my mother, i finally had the freedom to get access to the internet. albeit with an ancient computer that takes a whole minute to load a webpage but to me, it was gold. with me new found freedom, i started to listen to music. i realise really quickly that i've started to grow a love for music and not just listening to it. i decided that i want to learn music and asked my mother. she dissed me and said that i would most likely lose interest in it just like how i did for science. but she agreed to let me take up an instrument of my choice. the next few years are just me picking up the pieces i threw away in my childhood. i had to learn and remember what i used to love. i took this time to build up my identity again but my past still haunts me. i still had ups and downs. occasionally getting a suicidal relapse but nothing too serious. i tried to talk to my new classmates about my problems but they deemed me as attention seeking. so i hid it deep into my thoughts and never let it out again. i tried to convince myself that those days never happened and it was all a dream. but i know i would just be lying to myself. when i was 18, i meet my significant other through a mutual friend. he was more than i could have asked for and made me feel loved in a way i thought i never could. it's been 3 years going strong. i'm 21 and i'm okay now. i am and still would for the rest of my life be haunted by those years in my childhood. but they made me who i am. if i had a choice to go back in time and change something i don't think i would. on one hand, i want to see how i would turn out if i had not met my father. would i still continue to build up my curiousity and love for science? would i be someone more brilliant than i am today? i would never know. on the other hand... i am afraid of touching the past. i'm afraid that if i were to be given those choices again, my younger self would really have ended it then and there. however, my main reason for not changing anything is because i am happy now. if i could send a message to that little girl who cries herself to sleep every night, i would tell her to hang in there. i would tell her that if she felt as though she had reached rock bottom, it means the only way is up. that girl 10+ years ago in her wildest dream would never believe that she would become who i am today. an average human life-span is 80 years. i've live through a little more than a quarter of it. at 21, i've gotten a diploma in biomedical engineering, i'm looking to get a grade 8 in music theory by the end of this year. i've played in multiple orchestras and ensembles. i'm an aspiring author. i co-founded a company. i'm working full time in a laboratory. it isn't my dream job but i'm getting there. there's still a long way to go. 
i used to be somewhat motivated as a kid. now i dont have any objecyive in life. i dont feel like doing anything.

this video always cheers me up and makes me giggle, i hope it help someone else as well :)

how to make yourself do things
i can’t make myself do anything. i know exercise helps. i know getting out helps. but i just want to lay down and eat. and watch tv. and not talk to anyone. i can’t make myself do anything... anyone else struggling with this
this is for you !!!!!!!!!!!
i am not an educated person- not an expert at anything. but please - if you are hurting - take a moment in time with me .i know alot of people are going to take one look at this and say tl:dr fuck that  thats fine. you can go about your business - the words i present will simply be presented to you at a different time , in different forms - over and over until you are curious enough or motivated to get it this is not just for you , this is for me as well . however - if share with me some time --time i took to write this, the time you take to read and the time we share to comprehend -- i feel that things can be gained for both of us .sometimes you lose to gain how many times have you heard that cryptic ass message ? let me tell you what i know to be true - something ive experienced and my interpretation of that experience . i understand that much of what i say and write is also cryptic - my writing style strange. i will do my best to convey the message in my heart in the best possible way , so we may both survive this suffering.we lose and gain a great many of things in our life - in every stage of it. friends , opinions , beliefs - somethings the changes are big and sometimes they are little . but what happens we start to lose the physical things ? what happens when the things that we have used and worked for - that we need to survive in this society get taken away - while our minds flash to the dozens of homeless we walk by every day - filling us with that future fear of self? we lose hope what happens when your whole life you are different , you have issues - you dont fit in or belong - you try and try and try to do things but you just dont change . you keep repeating the same shit over and over - a revolution of self destruction with the creation of the new? you lose hope - over and over you go - lose hope . some of us will choose to end it all.first let me tell you this - understand this. think of all this pain you are going through right now - all this suffering - the feelings of hopelessness - i want you to recognize right now every fucking fiber of pain in your life yes i want you yo know its there , i want you to feel it .now i want you to think of your family , friends whoever you have love for - even those who you have had a falling out with and know for a dumb reason. i want you to think of all of them . ........think....... if you are at the point in your life that you are considering making a choice to force yourself from this living realm - we are our choices -i ask only that you consider this following question -- do i want to pass this pain onto them? because that what you are doing - you think you are ending your suffering but that is not the truth - pain is a way to recognition suffering - both those words cover a multiple of things and although many will consider the same - try looking at them separate . right now you are suffering in many ways - suffering physically and mentally - causing you pain in your body - your heart and mind . although these things can be considered separate they are also intertwined . energy cannot be destroyed - so although you may be ending the physical pain of your suffering - you will not be ending your suffering - it will simply be passed around to all those who you hold dear - all those who you love and have loved you . its weight is added to their own suffering - your old pain added to theirs . now there is a good chance one of them will also make that choice - the cycle and transfer continues . maybe your suffering is caused by some of those who are supposed to love you - maybe they have hurt you and you think this is the perfect way to get back at them . think about this - for all those who have hurt you , there are also those who love - even if you cant remember right now or see them - you gotta believe they are there because they are . is giving them your pain as well really worth it?there is hope - there is hope yes let me tel you there is hope . i know this - ive experienced these things . thats why i can go through them again now - sit in this fire and not be afraid. let me tell you my friends - why there is hope .you think these things that are slowly being taken away from you are things you need to survive. physical or otherwise - things you have worked towards and have built up and protected. things people say you needed or positions that you felt you needed to do - even right now - its a feeling of non-belonging . even after all this time , its just not working - and now they are being taking away . these last bits of things that we think are keeping us together . its not the end - who decides that ? who decides to be where - to do what ? who makes the choices ? you. so as long as you make the choice to move forward - there is hope.we have experienced it - the strange powers of the universe - the way it aligns things at just the right moments - the way it moves us into situations for reasons often at the time - far beyond our comprehensions. but sometimes we dont need to comprehend - we just need to trust in our grip and keep hanging on - we need to release ourselves from the fear induced visions of future - of what we think we will become because if not - we will become it . in this time of change - hang on - there are so many more thing to see and experience. hang on and breathe - do not be afraid and open your mind to the possibilities of these new experiences your reality can unfold into - think about it.maybe now - without these things that you thought you needed - you can experience thing you could have not before - because you had these things!life is not easy - i do not know exactly what you are going through but i do know this - we all go through this life with our burdens of suffering - it is our duty not pass them to others or to carry them ourselves - but to hold each others shoulders and walk together - making sure none of us fall behind . moving together with the understanding not of our individual pain - but our unified suffering - moving forward towards healing .it is worth it - you are worth it - do not succumb under the burden of your suffering but rather - hold your head high and back straight and move forward - if you stumble you have your friends to hold you - if you see others you pick them up . this is your - our- purpose . there are possibilities for you - there are choices - there is hope.you can do this - this is the proof - you have shared this time with me this far.yes you can do this - you are being molded so you may become something else - so you may evolve - do not fear the change . this is not an easy thing to do - but you can do it . this is the narrow path.
what do you do to curb your depression?
something i've noticed is that i feel especially depressed when i feel bored or alone. i'm trying to be more comfortable being alone without feeling alone. so far, i really love collaging and walking my dogs has really helped as well. also, cooking myself a decent meal! like, actually cooking, no microwave bullshit. i've also found that the cleanliness of my home plays a factor in my mood, so i set aside time everyday to clean up a bit whether it's doing laundry or simply wiping down the bathroom mirror and counter.so what do you guys do?
actual self portrait, watercolour and tears.

i feel so fucking worthless
i feel like i cant do anything by myself and i kind of feel like whether its work, relationships or just life in general i cant seem to understand anything about doing something by myself i've been dealing with this for the past year and a half and i'm not sure what to do.
losing hope
i'm 19, and i've wanted to die since elementary school. i was abused by my father for years and i have been raped by two different people in my early teens. i've never not thought about wanting to die. i just dont want to traumatize my friends and family with leaving this world. if i could leave without repercussions i would. i'm constantly anxious i cant talk to people and i worry about every little thing that might happen.i went to college and had a nervous breakdown. i was admitted to the er and i'm back home. i left school. i hate it. i hate this town it makes me miserable. my only way out was school but i couldnt even do that. i'm trying to go back. the prospect makes me so unbearablely anxious but the thought of staying somewhere where i'm so miserable makes me feel even worse. i'm trying to see a doctor or therapist or someone about everything but i couldn't even get a new patient appointment for months. i havent even gotten a call back for scheduling a consultation on treatment methods and it's been two months. everything seems so hopeless, my mom doesnt believe in mental illness and doesnt get it or even really try to. all my friends were older and moved away after they graduated. i just so desperately want to die. i just hope to get in an accident so that my family wont be stuck wondering why i killed myself. i'm losing hope i fear i'll never get better. does starting treatment always take so long? how much longer can i go?
numb
i’m sorry for anyone reading this. i mean, i don’t expect anyone to, but if you are thanks, i guess. you’re helping me feel heard. i didn’t know where else to post this, i just need it out. do you ever just feel numb? like no matter how hard you try to feel happy, you can’t? even the sad feels distant. like nothing is going right and no matter how hard you try to experience an emotion it dies after two seconds? i feel so empty and like i can’t do anything right and i’m getting real sick of it as i type this it’s been 4 hours since i tried to start cleaning my room. i’ve moved clothes. that’s it. how am i supposed to be happy when i can’t even make a happy environment for myself lmao.
anybody want to be my support group
i am a 25 yo female, desperate for attention, super insecure, and incredibly depressed contemplating suicide daily. could anybody be my positive friend where we can both remind each other why we should live?
talking to the boss about my depression
i haven’t been to work in three weeks. unsure how to talk to my boss about my depression. don’t know where to start or what to say? we have a good relationship (ie went to her baby shower) but i still like to keep things professional.i feel like i need to have solutions/actionables to talk about, showing i am trying to improve my mental health. but i don’t have a clear head to think about what im going todo for my mental health. even writing this was a challenge to sting my thoughts together.it drains me even more to think about having by to explain myself and then committing to fixing myself...
how can i get more easily out of bed in morning?
i have sometimes very hard to get out of bed and do my morning routine. sometimes i dont do my morning routine and i just go to school, even if i had time to do my morning routine i mostly just watch something from my phone and then go to school.lately  i have been kinda too much out of school, because od this problem.  i know one reason im so tired at morning is because i havent slept very well. i have waked up early like 7-8 am, but i just dont have motive to go up at that moment so i decide to stay on bed and think something sad or be on my phone.any tip is more than welcome.edit 1: thank you guys. i uploaded alarmy app and its helping me little bit with problem. i also use my old phone on waking me up, i put it away from me so i have to turn it off too and then with alarmy app i have to go take photo on bathroom.thank you for help ❤❤
how do i find a reason to continue living
up until recently i had a major depressive episode due to the girl who i liked and also in the past saved me from my miserable life literally just up and went, talking less and less and eventually not talking at all to me. back then i legitimately couldn't function without her, and really do appreciate my friends who gave me comfort throughout that period. i'm low key over that now (it's been like what 1 month) and the girl i like started talking to me again, although there's this impassable distance between us for some fucking reason which i don't know. i really have given up all hope of us being together, and have been trying to get on with my life without her. problem is, i've been relying on her for emotional and mental support for a little bit more than 2 years now, and quite frankly her not talking to me has left me really fucking broken. i don't know how to move on. i don't know what inspires me anymore. i guess i like writing books but everything seems so senseless to complete anymore, and i find myself wishing i was never even born in the first place many atimes. help. i don't know how to find reason to continue on with my life
another year gone...
tomorrow is my birthday and i’ve done nothing but manage to fuck up everything good in my life. my birthday haven’t even officially started and i already am regretting my existence. this probably won’t get seen but i just need a space to vent before i go insane. i’ve just been so bored and done with life. i have relatively no close friends besides my dogs and my exbest friend who i used to date and she left me earlier this year and also had just stopped talking to me all together won’t even be bothered to unblock me to say happy birthday. now i didn’t come here to get pity but rather im looking to find some hopeful positive outlooks and maybe a friend or two. something to give me hope that my life isn’t a mistake. btw i have aspergers and so being social isn’t my strong suit.edit: also posting on /r depression for people who see it twiceedit : thank you all for caring so much about me. it’s rly heartwarming to know that people still support me as a human and i haven’t lost all hope.
how do you love yourself
i am not sure what i love about myself. what do you do if you don't like yourself and don't know how to change?i'm always full of anxiety and fear. i hate it. i want to be someone i'm not, but don't know how to change that about myself
my girlfriend
my girlfriend has depression and it's really having  a huge impact on our relationship. we no longer talk or engage with each other. she sleeps all the time. if she's not sleeping she is on her phone zoning out. i'm finding my self withdrawing from her. we no longer are intimate emotionally or physically. i've spoken to her about the impact this is having on me, she acknowledges this nd within days it's back to the way it was.i'm trying to be as supportive as i can but it's so so hard.i just needed to let it out and have some one listen and get it.
how do i stop hating every single thing about myself?
i'm constantly tearing myself apart and telling myself everything that's wrong with me. i try to find things good about myself but then i just think about how most people are better off. i'm also judgmental of other people (only in my head), but at the same time i see all the nice things about them and how their flaws don't define them. i can look over every inch of myself (physically and mentally) and find something wrong with it. because of this i don't talk to people unless necessary  and afterwards i get mad at myself for the way my voice sounds or what i said. i also take everything personally which makes it even worse. i feel like this is ruining every aspect of my life and i don't know how to fix it. i just want to be happy.
tips for relapsing depression
i won’t make this post long, but any tips to get stop my relapsing depression in its tracks? i had chronic depression and suicidal thoughts when i was a teen. i don’t want to go back to that. any suggestions on how to break free from the cycle? i’m 23 and don’t know what tf i’m doing with my life. thanks. 
not to sure if this has too with my depression but
i can't eat i am a picky eater but since i was 7 i hated almost all my fav foods i only can eat fast food and enjoy it but i don't get it much so i rather just not eat and just drink something i dont hate my body or anything besides how i think it is too skinny but what should i do i need help what is wrong with me
i forget what happy feels like.
i have a lot of trouble with my memory. i know that i was a happy kid, but as i’m getting older, i’m sad all the time. my friends are telling me that i usually start to feel better as the weather warms up, but i genuinely can’t remember what that feels like. i’m not in crisis or anything, but it’s getting pretty bad. one of the things that used to help me is drawing, but even that isn’t making me feel better lately. i don’t really now what advice i need, but is there anything that has helped you? i’ll try anything at this point. 
healthy perspective?
has anyone discovered any healthy ways of getting a better perspective on life? my counselor says that comparison, e.g. the stereotypical one—at least you’re not a child starving in africa—is not healthy and tends to make you feel worse. i agree.
can't stop crying
yesterday someone emotionally scarred and hurt me with his words. i think i cried for almost 12 hours. i managed to sleep for 1 hour before classes and  i kept going to the toilet due to this crying. right now, i am crying for almost 1 hour something. i didn't eat yet since last night. i know it is self destructing. i just wanted this crying to stop. i don't have any medications as i am always afraid of the clinics. i have the urge to go but this crying.... stopping me from going anywhere. it would be nice and appreciated to get some supports from you guys here.  
anyone feel guilty ?
i’ve been struggling for the last 8 months , my one friend that i feel i can talk to about it tells me to go see a doctor , he sends me phone number / information etc. but no matter what i can’t bring myself to go. i’ve been fortunate in life , no tradgidies no deaths in the family no break ups or anything like that it’s just a depressed and anxious state of mind i’ve been in the last 8 months that i can’t get out of and i feel guilty about it. what if i build up the courage to go to one of these group sessions and people have a genuine reason to be depressed and when it comes to my turn to speak i have nothing. anyone else or just me ?
it hurts, it hurts so bad
i was doing better until i lost someone who was more like a father to me, (he's my best friends's dad)..it hurts so bad, it's been a week..fuck this shit
how do i comfortably talk to people again?
i'm not sure if i'm depressed, but it sure feels like it. i want to laugh and talk to people and not feel so awkward all the time. it's like i'm just stuck in my own head always thinking about what to say to be likeable, but when a situation arises with the opportunity to do so i can't speak. when i do i'm always tongue tied and afraid i'll sound stupid. how can i be happy and care free again?
hello from the other side
hello!i’ve dealt with depression, ptsd, and extreme anxiety for over three decades now.  during that time i’ve been hospitalized twice (once on a locked ward, once in an outpatient facility). i attempted suicide the first time and was seriously contemplating it the second time i was hospitalized.  my ptsd stems from a very brutal rape, but i had anxiety and depression-like tendencies before.despite all this, i have a successful career and a wonderful, loving spouse and son.  i do not say this to gloat,  but to perhaps help others by sharing my story.it has been a very hard road and it still is.  i take medication and will for the rest of my life (the second suicide attempt was a result of trying to come of the meds). i don’t like it, but i’ve accepted it.  some things i’ve learned during this battle:1. medications and therapy are absolutely essential to me.  not saying this is true for everyone, but they have really improved my quality of life.2.  healthy lifestyle choices help but don’t fix the problem.  3.  understanding cognitive dissonance and actively working to change my thinking has been extremely beneficial.  3.  i have moments of happiness and treasure them all the more because i know they are rare.  this doesn’t mean i’m down all the time; i’m perfectly happy with feeling content.  4.  my depression is cyclical, so to speak.  i go through weeks or months of extreme depression, but this has become bearable with time.  i now know there is an end to the pain and i can focus on the future when the horrible feelings threaten to overwhelm me.  5.  the average person has no understanding of depression.  i describe it as a state of inertia; one is so caught up in the misery and despair that they are unable to take the steps needed to begin recovery.  it’s a truly horrible situation to be in.  so, as to the purpose of this post.  i am not a doctor,  although my career (education) has given me an insight into how the brain works.  that being said, my experience in coping with severe, crippling depression is perhaps one of my strongest “gifts.”  i understand what people are going through and i want to help.  i’m here to talk, as a friend, a mentor, or just someone to vent to.  i will be your sounding board b/c someone once offered to be mine when i desperately needed it.  i can offer advice based on my personal experience or just listen when you vent. but perhaps the best thing i can offer is understanding and empathy.    if anyone needs someone to talk to, i am only a pm away.  how have you dealt with your depression?  i’m always looking for new advice!
made a youtube to motivate me to clean my room. anyone else struggle with cleaning up while depressed? glad i finally asked for help. self care (not always bubble baths and facemasks) helps

open letter to people who know someone struggling with depression

depression test

hate life want to die
so this is going to be kind of long. sorry in advance.i am a very lonely person, i have literally no friends. zero! the last time i hung out with a single person outside of school activities was in the 7th grade i'm 22 now. i am a naturally introverted person but i have had no friends for so long that i am desperate.i have very bad social anxiety. i also have a condition called nf type 1 for short read about it here (http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/neurofibromatosis-) i think i might be autisitc too but that's a story for another time.so this condition gives me very low self esteem and makes me feel real ugly. my face is noticeably disfigured because of it.  now sometimes i accept that fact that i'm ugly; however when i look myself in the mirror or when people in public ask me what's wrong with my face it's a constant reminder that there's something wrong with me and there's nothing i can do to change it. ( don’t google image nf those are very rare cases ) this makes me very lonely and depressed because i don't know anyone else with this condition. it also makes it hard to find a girlfriend. i just wish i could find a person that goes through the same struggles as i do.i just feel too ugly and awkward to talk to girls. but, i am also afraid to get into a relationship because i would hate to watch her  get sad when i'm going through a hard time or if my condition gets worse and i die because of it and there was nothing she could do to help. now, that i have this disease there is a very high likely hood of me my passing it onto my kids. what if my hypothetical wife wanted kids? that would be a problem because i don’t them, i would hate to see another person suffer like i do! i hope all that made sense. i am also a kissless virgin. at night i'll watch videos of pretty actresses or of pretty girls on youtube before i go to bed. then i will hug my pillow and pretend they are right there with as if they were my girlfriend. i'll go as far as kissing the pillow and talking to it. if get up in the middle of night to use the bathroom i'll come back  and tell them i'm sorry for waking them. i wish i had girlfriend not just for sex but to cuddle with especially on those cold nights. but most importantly as a companion one who could be my best friend. i know there are people who probably have it worse but i always feel alone! anways that's my story i'm sorry for shitty grammar and stuff it's really late at night as i'm writing this. also  i forgot to mention i'm half retarded and a terrible writer. any help/advice would be nice thank you
hey there; i'm new to reddit, and this is my first real post, but i just want to offer my company to anyone at any time, day or night. comment on the thread, message me, whatever it may be. whether you need a friend day to day, someone to help you out of the darkness, or just someone to listen.

i have suffered with depression on an off, this guy has changed my life...for those open to an esoteric/spiritual explanation of depression and mental health here is the interview...

has anyone else struggled to keep a job because of depression? has anyone here overcome it?

boyfriend doesn’t understand my mental illness...
i’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year now and my depression has flared up and usually does when i am on my period. the issue is that my boyfriend doesn’t believe in therapy and doesn’t see it as an issue but my “behavior” is affecting our relationship. as much as i try to explain that i can’t control it, that i am handling it, and that i would appreciate his support, he doesn’t know how to support me and becomes distant when i try and open up to him about it. how do i try to help him understand what is happening and how to best explain my symptoms and what i need from him? or is this just something that i can’t talk about with him and is there a way that i can establish a code word when i start to feel bad so that i can have my space when i feel this way (even though i would really appreciate his support when i feel like this)?
for people who overcome their depression
i am sure that there is people who overcome it , how did you do it and what worked for you?answers greatly appreciated.thanks.
the difference going outside can make.
i was feeling terrible this morning; life didn’t seem worth it. i forced myself to get up, get ready and go to school. on the way there i was catastrophizing everything, verging on a breakdown.anyway, once i was at school i found concentrating on the task at hand helped occupy my mind. afterwards, i visited a friend and took a walk. now i feel great.depression is a long struggle; some days you wake up normal and optimistic, some days you wake up wanting to die.for me, getting outside and doing anything that demands my focus can be very helpful. i really hope all of you who are struggling can persevere and find some activity which’ll help.
if no one reads this it's ok.
how did i end up this way, how did i get this way, the things i think about everyday. i think about all the friends i have, i think with all the friends i have why do i still feel so lonely i think maybe. i should get someone,someone i could play with ,cuddle with,i remember get a hug from a girl recently and i almost broke into tears i wanted to stay in her arms i want something like this, someone i could be myself with, mean something to someone else to feel significant. then one though leads to a thousand others, a though of who am i what is my true self,why do feel hungry and full at the same time why do i feel unsatisfied ,why does it feel uncomfortable eating,why does it feel awkward when someone asks are you ok?why can i say no, how do i say help.why can't i say it? i am i a burden? why does it feel like no matter i  how hard i try it feels like i am destined it fail.why does every reason for living i can come up with seem invalid? why does it feel like everytime i go to sleep i won't wake up why does it sometimes feel like i lose the will to breathe. i really don't want to die its just seems to be the easy way out,it feels like the fastest way out.the one question i ask myself every day is where do we go when we let go,how do we know when to let go. is there a point to talk to anyone,it's hard to keep up a conversation ,but when someone talks to me i never have the energy to talk back.ii can't save myself i tried,l screamed for help but nobody came,now i feel like there is no point for me to call out for help.what if someone comes, could i be saved?
i got a job job.
i haven’t had a w-2 job in almost 7 years. first i was dealing with heroin & meth addiction. then i got clean and suffered years of drug induced depression that was devastating. now i’m slowly recovering from all of that and got a job! it’s only seasonal but that’s perfect and luckily it doesn’t have anything to do with customer service because i’m burnt out dealing with guests. i’m just so excited because it’s been so long and so many applications and finally i got a job! anyways thanks for reading.
trying to get loved ones to understand
does anyone else find that their friends and family have a hard time understanding that depression can, and most likely will return? even when you're doing everything you can to try to keep it under control?my friends and family don't understand why sometimes i might be worrying or upset about the same thing i was upset about last week. they act frustrated because they tried to help and they wonder why i'm still upset about the same thing. they act as though their words and support are just in vain but it's not that it's just depression is persistent.i'm sure it's exhausting to be around but the pressure i feel to not act depressed seems insurmountable. why are people so hard on people who are depressed?
cleaning service?
i feel lots of shame posting this.i pretty much live in my partner's room (she lives with roommates). both of us have depression & anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. we've been very isolated to our room. it's already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, it's more and more cluttered, including boxes of take-out.its state affects us very much and though we've tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we haven't been able to do much.we talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. i also know a few skill-trading groups where i could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. i also thought of asking friends for help, but i'm scared of imposing. we don't have that much money either, but honestly we haven't been able to do much for a while now and i just need help to take a step forward. i just feel like i'm being very lazy doing so. and i'm not sure where to start. did anyone considered or tried doing something like that? does it make sense?
i feel so empty
i feel so empty. i don't know why. i have everything i've ever wanted, but i still feel empty and lonely. lately i've been feeling like just ending everything. i dont know what im doing with myself
after 12 years...
so i was going to moe's today and it just kinda hit me: i'm doing it. i'm living my best life. i'm working, bills are paid, i might not have friends rn but that's okay. like i'm doing my best y'know? and i don't think i've ever felt like this before. it's ... liberating.i hope you all have a phenomenal day and that one day this feeling becomes the norm for us all. big love to everyone who sees this.
my friend wants to commit suicide, and has opened up to me about it. can the community please help me with how to speak to him about this. i've never had someone need me like they do tight now, and i don't know what to do
sorry i didn't explain, this is mostly about a girl he was with for a few months, but he fell in love and she was his first for everything. so advise on how to address this so we can help him move on would be so amazing from you all
sooo tired of this
i’ve had anxiety and depression on and off for since i was a child. i haven’t had any issues for several years. i started to notice a few months ago my temper getting shorter, and bursts of anger. then horrific anxiety that is just nonstop. i started taking prozac again, and i have an appointment with behavioral therapy next week.i’ve been taken the prozac for barely a week. i’m trying to give it a few weeks, but this is horrible. it is taking so long to work, and i feel horrible. at times i can feel it starting or attempting to level out my moods, but what i am feeling intense.i am someone that isn’t very emotional, i am very logical, and don’t care what other people think. now, i am paranoid and even bearing the phone ring gives me a panic attack. i even accused my husband of cheating even though i know that isn’t what he is doing or would do. if we have an issue with one another we are the type to discuss it even if someone’s feelings may be hurt, if it is necessary. i apologized to him about it since i knew it wasn’t the case, but i feel like shit since i can’t control my damn emotions, outbursts, crying spells.. i am overthinking everything, and extremely paranoid. i feel like people are looking at me strangely, i dropped two classs i was taking since i can’t concentrate or remember anything. i can see if behavorial therapy will give me an off work order until it mellows outthe pain is just nonstop, and now i’m starting to get insomnia. it’s just that weird achy feeling in your chest, paranoia, crying frequently, it just doesn’t stop.i do have some stress in my life, but i feel like these issues just won’t go away. i’ve done mediation, relaxation techniques but my body is constantly in fight or flight mode, especially the last two days. . i am worried that behavorial therapy won’t be able to help me, and that this pain will be here for the rest of my life. i hate it. i’m an independent person, and i have to be reminded to eat something, i feel helpless. i feel a bit of depersonalization.. and i know that what i’m thinking ridiculous.. but it is just like you have someone besides you telling you the most negative shit so that you don’t trust yourself.
tw: suicide
everytime im taking a bath, i suddenly get this impulse of filling the bath tub and drowning myself. ive done it three times but today i couldnt bring myself to completely filling up the tub because im in my parent's bathroom and i dont want to ruin my parent's life because of me and my suicidal ideations. i ended up dissociating afterwards and now im just sitting in the bathroom contemplating about why im alive and whh im even bothering myself to write this post
was going to hang myself today
finally gathered the guts to do it and found the means to do it (describing those would get me banned from this sub). talked to this one friend who sticks around because of pity. got me chessmated when she said she'll tell my sister to call an ambulance. i knew the ambulance would be here before i was dead. she got me to go to the crisis place at the hospital where i got sedative meds to calm me down. i really regret that i didn't just do it. life is nothing but pure pure agony. there is nothing to live for.
i feel like a failure.
i'm going to have to move back home after 2 years almost being on my own. i feel like a failure, moving in with my parents at 20.
like i always say enjoy the good days (me sounding like a broken record)

nothing ever goes right in my life
this is going to be long. i hate my life so much. nothing i do ever goes right. there must always be something that will pull me down to the lowest. from 2012 till now, nothing ever seem to go right.i was always indirectly targeted by my secondary school classmates back then for being quiet, socially awkward and nerdy. i reached a breaking point in 2012 where i literally skipped 1.5 months of school because i cannot handle the environment there. not only that, my cat passed away in 2012 as well to make things more worse for me. and the thing i regretted till now is that i wasn't there to see him take his final breath. he was always there for me when i was studying or doing my stuffs. then in 2013, i started to have feelings for a girl whom i thought is nice and friendly. but when class rumors say that i was interested in her, she shut me down completely. she avoided me as if i am a disease to her. her friends and her started make rumors about me being ugly, disgusting, desperate and anything to humiliate me. i remembered one of the things they said to me and it goes like this you will always remain alone for the rest of your life and you are going to grow old and die alone. it have reached to the stage where 85% of my class were making fun me of me. i broke down in the toilet 2 times in that year. that was the very first time i thought of suicide. then i received my national exams (took in 2013) in 2014, i didn't do that well to go for the course i wanted which i also cried. my aunt (and my dad's family members) continuously told me going to a science course is equivalent to not having a future. they keep forcing me to choose business or marketing which i have no interest whatsoever. they said i was a disgrace to the family for not doing that well as compared to my cousin who took the same national exams. in 2014, i was enrolled in a tertiary school (i was studying chemical engineering). met 2 close friends there (guy a and girl b for easier references). classmates were much better which i am thankful for. guy a and girl b studied together with me and most of the time, i would help them out if they need help. i helped girl b the most because her maths foundation is not that strong. i even sacrificed my sleep to help her out at 3am the day before the exam because i want my friends to do well too. 2015 was one of the worst years of my life. guy a lost interest in the course and decided to move over to business, leaving me and girl b alone. that fateful day, i asked girl b about some slides which i dont understand despite trying my best. she shouted why cant you be more independent? i hate when people keep asking me for help to me at a bus stop where there are quite a number of students there. i was completely speechless when she said that. i was so embarrassed that i ended up walking away from the bus stop and took a different route back home. days passed and i tried to talk to her if she may have home issues because it was unlike of her to lash out at people. but she always told me to go away or dont talk to her anymore. and soon, i began to feel more down, more distracted, lonely and etc. my grades started to drop a bit because in my mind, i was still bothered by the fact that she betrayed/backstabbed me just because i asked her for help. doing school projects with her (teacher assigned the groups and i was grouped with her, fml) was so difficult because she refused to listen to my ideas, constantly turning her body away when i speak, not acknowledging my presence at all. i started to become more frustrated and angrier with each passing day until to the point, i pulled/pushed the door hard when i am using it. it's so happens that i slammed the door when she was about to use it and idk if it hits her or not but i dont think so. my thoughts are becoming more cluttered as the experience from 2012 and 2013 started to come back. and i soon developed insomnia because of it. every night, i keep thinking of the bad stuffs that had happened to me. i stopped smiling afterwards. i cant cry at all. my heart feels so heavy but yet so tight when i feel sad. i began to lose interest in the things i used to enjoy. i started to isolate myself from my classmates and basically anyone. i always cover my face with a hoodie and wear my earpieces in school, refusing to talk to anyone.in 2017, i was called for conscription (it's compulsory where i lived) for 2 years. i was constantly under fear as my sergeants shouted at me for not doing things properly. i just cannot adapt being in the army but what am i supposed to do? even if i tried to seek help from the medical officer there, they would just threaten to charge us for malingering. i keep getting sick during my stay at the training camp for 2 months straight. coughed out blood multiple times and high fever but i still continued training. until late july 2017, i fell down from a high obstacle, landing on my hip and i was posted out to another camp afterwards. i lost feeling in my right leg and i was limping for almost 11 months because of it. i couldn't even run till now. sometimes, i feel that i should have just died when i fell from that obstacle. i really wished i did. even in the new camp, i would always feel fearful of the army staffs there. earlier this year, i had a panic attack in camp after i was forced to do several administrative jobs for my superiors. only then, i seek help from the doctor and they diagnosed me with major depression disorder, generalised anxiety disorder with panic attacks. i told my psychiatrist everything since 2012. my psychiatrist even told me that my depression and anxiety probably started in 2012 and 2013 based on his judgment.then i started talking to this girl online whom i have an interest in. eventually, we decided to meet up and it was fun. nice person in general. however when she suspected that i have feelings for her, she started to ignore me or reply a day later despite being active on the other group chats (we both are in the same group chats). so, my depression got more worse because of it. i am okay with being rejected because i know that it was going to happen. but because of my feelings, i lost a friend. i refused to meet anyone even when people asked me out because i feel embarrassed. even now when i see her hanging out with other people, i feel demoralized because i was shunned down for having a heart or something. my thoughts keep telling me that it is because of my ugly face that is causing me to get turned down everytime i tried.i just don't know what to do anymore. no one cares about the troubles i have to deal with. no one cares about how difficult it is for me to go through each day. no one cares about my feelings and emotions. people always tell me to share my problems with them. when i do, i was constantly told that depression is just my negative mentality and i need to get over it and stop being childish. i feel like i am not apart of this world. i see everyone in colours but myself in black. maybe i shouldn't be born in the first place so no one need to deal with a fucked up person like me.

struggling with a profound feeling of disconnection and apathy
due to autism, it’s not terribly easy for me to identify my feelings but i seem rather lost in myself at the moment. i seldom feel ‘present’ when i’m speaking to anyone and it’s extremely difficult for me to think clearly.it’s approaching four weeks since i stopped taking citalopram (i was on it for well over a year) but i still seem to be struggling somewhat with discontinuation syndrome. my mind is rather foggy. i can’t concentrate. i keep disengaging/withdrawing from those around me, and i always feel tired.whilst i weaned off citalopram far too quickly, i was expecting problems with withdrawal to only last a few weeks yet it’s been 25 days and i’m still feeling rather strange.i’m struggling to determine if it’s a relapse back into depression, anxiety/dissociation or something else. if anyone has experienced anything similar, i’d be interested to know what helped - if anything. i don’t particularly want to go back on antidepressants, though. they just seem to make my difficulties with asd and adhd even more complicated.thanks.

a look into depression pt. 1

i need you
i need you. i lost all my friends, and their respect. im all alone. i don't know what to do, noone wants to talk to me. 
the siren of hope

i thought i was done with this.
i just made a difficult admission to my husband, i need my happy pills again. it's time for me to get back on antidepressants.i don't like to admit that i need them, but i do. i know it's okay to need them, i have a degree in psychology, i know it's okay... it's just not necessarily that simple in my twisty mind; i don't want to need them. i guess i'm posting this to remain accountable. i loathe going to the doctor, but i need to, i can't continue to put this off and let it worsen.i've been self medicating with marijuana for the past few years years, but i was just checking out mentally all too often. i want to be more present in my life. i'm a month clean now and trying not to fill the void of weed with alcohol and binge eating... easier said than done. i need help (that was difficult to admit just now)! i just found this community. thanks for reading my ramblings if you did.  i'm also more of a lurker than a poster, sorry if it this post is off. 
does my depression has to do anything with my lack of will to perform in school? yes, right?
yesand it sucks (almost as much as i do!) 
every time i think i’ve beaten one period of depression, another one starts.
i’m at my wit’s ends.every time i think i’ve beaten one period of depression and gotten better, another begins.i feel like a burden to everyone. i’m tired of talking about myself. my own best friend disappears at the times when i need him the most leaving me feeling so alone. is there any way out of this? i’m so tired of this cycle.
thinking of quitting my psychiatrist
i've seen this guy for more than a year now, and it's been helpful.  but this week he opened a session basically as a confrontation.  he handed me a bill with heavy unpaid charges (among them six sessions that haven't been processed by my insurance yet), and he asked what i had to say.  it was all a bit surreal.  the prior week i'd actually reached out to his office and asked them to figure out what i owed after insurance, and with the understanding i was to pay that after the session the other day.   they were fine with that. his bills he mails me are always flawed, and the amount i owe is never the amount due in the bill.i told him how i'd requested them to get me the amount actually due, and my plan to pay, and he said if he'd known that, he wouldn't have done what he did.however, i no longer trust this guy.  i was really shaken up by the whole episode, and i still am.  i feel ambushed and abandoned.  the point of therapy is to have some kind of trusting, safe environment. this guys office said my plan to pay was cool.  in a year he's never spoken to me about billing.  and he could have brought up his question up in a gentle way, as a question, but instead was in your face with this paper demanding an explanation.  i basically feel like he burnt through all the good will he'd built up this year, so i'm sad about that, and i'm pissed at what i feel was an aggressive move.  i think he thought i was a deadbeat, but i was really actually trying to navigate his flawed billing statements and my incompetent insurance company, while making sure he gets paid once in a while. 
my girlfriend's experience with depression and anxiety. she is so courageous to me. hope some of you can find solace with her.

the worst part of this condition: hurt everyone you love
probably most of you have to deal to this problem, all my relationship with friends and relative had been affected by this condition (the fact that i have to hide it isn’t very helpful i know), sometimes the damage that i cause is huge, i’m tired of everything but especially of this it’s not fair and i have to stop do you have any advice? sadly no one know e they will never know so it’s a bit difficult.
me rn!

burnout after burnout
how the fuck do you rest and allow your body to recoup after a burnout when you can’t financially let your body or mind rest because you experience financial issues already. i feel like it’s impossible to let my body rest as much as i need and also continue to support myself financially. i’ve already dropped out of school but it still seems like i’m not getting any better. i am the only one i feel like i can depend on. help...?
i'm starting to feel a lot of pressure to have sex from my friends and it's really gotten into my head
i (16m) have depression and can't really manage a relationship or strong romantic attractions anymore. like any other 16 year old guy i want to have sex, but i don't want to just do a hook up or a one time thing with someone who doesn't mean anything to me. i really only want to have sex with someone i'm really emotionally attached too, and i also want my first time to be with someone else who hasn't done it yet. i kinda just assumed that sex would come in it's own time until i broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now i'm being told that i should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. she was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason i need it to be someone else's first time too. she basically made fun of me for not having had sex before, and i never really cared about losing my v-card, but now i'm thinking about how belittled i feel knowing that i haven't had sex whereas many of my friends have and now i notice all of them sorta expect me to have it as well, and even though i want it to be special and real they still see me differently for not having had it (some context-my friends are also fucking nerds and it is beyond me how any of them have had sex yet). i guess i'm looking for advice or consolidation, but i just don't really know what to do. this isn't exactly the root cause of my depression or anything but it certainly is impacting my mental health
i officially hate christmas
tl;dr: depression came back to me and i don't even get the time of day from family which makes it worseso this is the year i break, i hate christmas, every single year i have to spend it with family that is constantly judging me, breaking my stuff, leaving my room a mess, annoying family stuff etc., anyways, what i would at least look forward to was that my parents got me something i asked for because i barely asked for anything but year after year i've been getting less love, gifts, etc. from them despite me being the main reason the house isn't a mess or burned down, i didn't really care much but with my depression coming back i really just hoped they'd at least say they love me but guess what they didn't and they instead got extended family we don't talk to much any attention, expensive gifts, and more, all i got was a broken heart, the feeling that i'm being disposed of, and a broken door, i know people have it worse than i do but i just really wanted my family to show they care, even if i got no gifts i wouldn't have minded if they showed they care but they don't, sorry for such a long rant
i don't care anymore
this last week has been hell, it started with my father in law  being rushed to the hospital, we still don't know what happened he is home now doing better. then my dad was rush in to hospital last monday, had to stents placed. i have missed a week of work dealing with all of this my wife and i have no help from our brothers. thanksgiving was hard for me because i had to look at the two people that were no help at all ,my brother didn't call to see about my dad at all until he and his kids showed up at my moms for thanksgiving. i fell like i am falling down a black hole i am not angry i am not upset i just don't have it in me anymore i don't care anymore i am tired i hurt no one cares or understands shake it off they say you are being self centered it's not about you everyone needs me to be strong but i just can't anymore if i wasn't a coward i would just be done with it all. meds don't help name i took it . i just want it to stop go back to when i was happy i don't see anyway out.
finding little bits of joy
a co worker showed her care for me by bringing me my favorite apple she gets for her family but they don't eat them. she asked a while back which ones i like. so whenever she goes to lunch she always asks me if i would like one. the fact she does little things like this to make me feel better is amazing.i'm getting her a gift for xmas. :) when someone who has only known you for like 9 months brings you treats on a bad day it really makes your problems seems small.i'm so thankful i know her and have the joy of working with her.she's amazing.
this is an incredible video. hope this helps whoever needs it.

i’m recovering, but friends are still in the hole.
just needing a little advice. i’ve been making huge leaps towards recovery (therapy, medication, gathering a network of supportive friends), but i still like to talk to my old friends, however they’re still in their rut and all of our conversations are about how much they don’t want to live anymore and how nothing will get better for them. i try to be supportive, i try to help but of course, nothing i say changes anything unless they get help. am i an asshole for just keeping our interactions short?
i feel like shit right now.
i do everything for my daughter. i’m with her dad but he doesn’t know anything about raising her. he slept in while i bathed her and got her breakfast and when he took her to the gas station he thought the pringle’s he got was her breakfast and was like, oh well”. it’s that shit constantly. leaving shoes outside floating in the pool or being chewed up out there by the dog overnight on an almost daily basis for a week. never changing her diaper. he just put her to bed in a wet bathing suit. i always have to get his attention when my daughter is trying to talk to him, even if i am further away from her than he is. everything is a mommy job. he asked me a couple weeks ago where to find her socks in her room and it’s the same place it’s been for 3+ years. he will act super fun around her when he’s in public but when he’s at home he just doesn’t notice her. we have all of these little games we play. my hand is a bug. sometimes it’s evil and sometimes it’s nice. either way it tickles. i ask her if her belly etc is a belly or ice cream, then say let me check! and pretend to bite and tickle her. i could go on and on. and he doesn’t have any of those things. she gets mad when he walks in the door. she is just mad at him a lot in general and it’s the honest truth. i try to lie to my bf about him not doing anything wrong but i feel like she gets a certain vibe. she won’t ever kiss him, but that may be the facial hair. today all i asked was if he was going to leave the pool area, to please put the life jacket on our daughter. and he told me to do it myself. i suffer from bad balance. i can’t just freely run down a flight of stairs, even at my moms, going down the two steps of her porch, sometimes i freeze up and get nervous about falling and i don’t know why. i feel mentally handicapped when it happens like whyy. but i was feeling anxious about my daughter running around the pool (she’s 3) and i had higher than normal shoes on and it was a high deck with a lot of stairs i’d have to carry her down. i weigh 95 lbs and she weighs 35. i can pick her up but sometimes it’s a struggle. not even like i can’t lift her i just knew me being right by the edge of a pool that was 2ft below me would make me anxious. just asked him.i never ask him to do anything for her. he’s never bought her a pair of shoes. he doesn’t think about those things. even today when we went to this party with a pool, we brought a bathing suit for him and our daughter and two towels. i thought he had my stepdaughters bathing suit situation worked out bc he said he’d pack for us and turns out she didn’t have a bathing suit. so i leave the party with the girls and go buy one. he can’t even have the forethought to think him and one of his daughters will want to swim, maybe the 12 year old will too. don’t worry, i’ll go buy the bathing suit and you can play with them in the pool and look like an all star dad. he told me i am being a paranoid helicopter mom wanting my 3 year old to wear floaties while she’s running around an open deck with a 2ft drop into the pool. if she fell in he was sure he’d get to her in time. calling me a coward bc maybe she won’t die if she falls in but let’s not make it worse than it has to be.he doesn’t remember anything. leaves rotting fruit in her diaper bag and the dog will get into it, spread it around the house staining my couch and rugs and he will walk right past it and go to work. i work full time too. i just can’t be constantly told what i do is just expected. it is and i do enjoy being a mom. i don’t need praise. but don’t tell me i’m asking too much when i want you to do something bc you’d be better bc you’re stronger. he was just doing backflips off the edge of the pool. i’m afraid to stand next to it. i’m not terrified but a favor or a helping hand doesn’t need to be on a matter of life or death basis.
what depression has made me see
i’ve been suffering from depression for 4 years now. that means spending a lot of time in my room. the whole day in fact. i don’t wake up till 3 pm and go to sleep at 5 am during the summer. i spent a lot of time watching movies and listening to a lot of music from every genre. people are normally surprised at how much i know of movies and music. it’s made me see a lot. i’ve traveled the world through movies and lived different lived through music. i have discovered beauty, hurt, lose and pain. i’ve become a person. i’ve become me. depression, you have taken a lot from me but you’ve given me the gifts of art. sure you’ve made me hate my body, myself, other people, and the world but you made me discover an outlet to escape into. one day i hope we can part for good. i’ll never forget what you’ve done to me, but i’ll also never forget what you’ve given to me. thank you
how can someone tell me suicide isnt the option it they’ve never been suicidal

how to show so appreciation for their help?
lately i've been having more crying spells & more depressing days, to which my so has been my rock. i'm actively working on bettering myself but also i know it has been taxing on our relationship, especially emotionally for them. for people who have been in my situation,  what small things made a difference to show thanks?
i have forced myself into isolation because of how i drain my friends. if something does not change i am going to kill myself
due to my depression my girlfriend dumped me four months ago. i have felt worthless since. i was still attached to her hip and wore her out. i would question her about why she doesn’t want me and try to get back with her. one of her friends was really trying to help me too but i just cut contact cause i know i’ll just do the same to her. i hate myself. i’m only a junior in high school so i have no control over my life, but if something doesn’t change i’m going to have to do it cause i can’t live like this. i don’t believe in god and have no passion or motivation. a life without friends or intimacy is a meaningless one to me. i am already medicated and in therapy but i’ve gotten no where. my only refuge is sleep. i don’t see any way and no one takes me seriously. what do they want me to do? just run around fucking girls i don’t love or doing drugs? i could do that and maybe drugs would help cause otherwise there is no point in me staying here. it’s so tempting to stockpile my sleep aid and just knock myself out for awhile. i had hobbies but i no longer care about them, school is torture anymore and my grades are awful i’m just so close to death and i can feel it. i feel like people don’t come back from this far out. does anyone have any advice? 
i am done
hi i know everybody has their own share of depressions and problems in life and i for one have no one to listen to me. i am here to ask you guys for an advice. i’ve did some things that i know was wrong and now i’m facing the consequences of my actions. i’m the type of person who puts her emotions first so it affects all of my decisions. i really don’t know what to do. i feel so alone and lost. i said i won’t do suicide or would be depressed but it’s eating me up inside. please give me your advices :(

it's like i keep having to feel like shit and then not for a bit and then i feel like shit again over and over and over. and i can never relax cause i know eventually i'm going to fuck something up and make myself sad again but there's nothing i can do about it. i've tried talking to family about this but the next day they act like i never even said anything. it's like i'm living in this cycle of feeling like garbage and then being anxious about how i'm going to feel like garbage later. i don't know what to do anymore. 
coffee
i've been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety in college or university over the past few years. before i would just take enormous amounts of psychedelics and various other drugs. this year has been especially tough. i live with roommates i dont really know. haven't really had time to hang out with friends due to work. i find myself sad and worrying about if i have something wrong with me because i'm struggling so hard with socializing and just managing my life. long story short i've been drinking coffee non stop from when i wake up until like 9pm just to get motivation to literally do anything. i'm not typically a coffee drinker but its the only thing that will help with my lack of wanting to do anything. i'll literally sit in my room, smoke weed, watch tv shows, and lay there for hours. this will probably backfire eventually but any input on how i should actually deal with my issues instead of coffee would be appreciated.
despite the anxiety, despite the depression, despite all my self criticism and imperfections - i was a beautiful bride this saturday!

today i promised myself bacon and eggs if i could get myself to a coffee meet up. i was too anxious to attend last week. guess who got bacon and eggs?!! feeling so proud of myself for going.

have my first real, adult, job interview today! not only that, but i also managed to drive by myself in city traffic! two small victories 

professor here, if you have missed class, please come back. we aren’t mad at you.

today is my cake day and i wanted to post a pic of me smiling for once. things are starting to look up.

i am busy.

message from your future self

1. anxiety makes it hard to go to sleep 2. depression makes it hard to get out of bed 3. drink coffee for a boost 4. caffeine makes anxiety worse 5. repeat
just one of the hellish cycles that anxiety gets me caught in. can anyone else relate?
i was thinking why this sub has a lot more upvotes than comments, realized people are too anxious to comment,lol
edit: welp reaching over 2000 upvotes makes me anxious to post anything here again, so i guess this will be my only post :p
my gal sprankles - she always knows how to comfort me after a bad panic attack 

hey if you know someone has anxiety please don't text them we need to talk and then not reply for 7 hours fuck
just needed to get that out there
three weeks ago i booked this trip to hawaii by myself, and three weeks later i’m happier than ever.

after 4 years of gad and 1 year of agoraphobia - i finally went out to eat by myself... i feel like i can conquer the world!

due to severe hand tremors from anxiety i’ve had to quit sketching and inking for several years. finally am managed enough by medication that i could finally finish this piece :)

drawing i made about panic attacks and anxiety...helps me process everything in a new way

just a friendly reminder that anxiety attacks aren’t always hyperventilating & rocking back and forth. they are also random bursts of irritability, obsessive behavior and nit picking, hypersensitivity, pacing, silence, zoning out. always look for signs with your loved ones

my girlfriend made me a calming jar

i was scared of leaving the house but i managed to push myself and it was pretty

i wanted to share my new embroidery with you all as a reminder of your value ❤

i don't think people realize how much strength it takes to pull your own self out of a dark place mentally. so if you've done that today or any day, i'm proud of you.
edit: i heard the quote somewhere, doesn't belong to me. :)
this is the first time i have been to the movies since getting ptsd and the first time ever going to a movie solo!! had lots of anxiety, did it anyway, and now feel super badass!

i went to the gym and i didn’t die!!! (i’ve had public workout anxiety since elementary school)

might need a pick me up

anxiety is having a wonderful day ahead of you but not enjoying it because you’re thinking about that 2 minute phone call you’ll have to make in five days.
edit: sometimes i just feel so alone, sometimes more than 1.5k people relate to me. thank you. 
i experienced the worst panic attack i’ve ever had. this is my bunny, chicken, helping me feel better

service dog senses and responds to owner's oncoming panic attack

when you're calm and relaxed

today is a hard day. my cat knows exactly when i’m having a panic attack and cuddles with me until i calm down. animals are magical. ❤️

my family isn’t the most understanding when it comes to my anxiety so i lean a lot on my cats for support. i did some photo art about how i see them.

ain't that the truth...

anxiety is waking up 3 hours before your alarm and not being able to fall back asleep because you're worried you won't be able to fall back asleep.
thanks brain.
i'm so anxious while doing schoolwork that my fitbit thinks i'm working out

i made a lil comic based on a post i saw here about work while having anxiety. so here it is.

trying to sleep with anxiety is like trying to sleep with relentless pop up ads in your mind

i fucking hate social anxiety because you’re scared to talk to people but also dying to talk to people and hang out and relax and have fun and not be alone and lonely and feel like shit but you do feel like shit because you can’t even relax enough to talk to people without overthinking everything

i know a lot of us take antidepressants for anxiety so here's a map i made about it

does anyone else's anxiety make them waste an entire sunday and then when nighttime hits, your anxiety ramps up because you know you have to work the next morning?
that beast gets me every time. never ending cycle. update: i want to apologize in advance if this post header made anyone's anxiety even worse. not my intention to do so! and wow 1k up-votes. thank you all! you are truly amazing, strong, capable and lovely people and thank you for coming together to support one another in this loving community. sending the most positive vibes for each and everyone of you to have a lighthearted sunday evening and an even better monday. ❤️
feeling so proud of: -present me- for going to my exercise class even though i was late and was anxious people would be mad. -past me- for getting up the guts to start going to the class in the first place. that was super scary! now it’s a routine it’s easier to go.

i painted health anxiety... at least how it feels to me.

just managed to successfully complete a 9 hr shift at work today (i cook at a pizza hut) after suffering a panic attack on shift just last sunday.

is this also you? because this is me.

anxiety is sending an email and then not checking your email for 3 days because you're scared of seeing the reply.

do what you can with what you have wherever you are.

my wife has been suffering v.badly with anxiety these last 3 years. has been in and out of hospital and we have two small children. she's finally got back into her drawing which has started to have a real calming effect. (i took a quick photo while she was upstairs as i am so proud of her). hope!

does anyone else ever take out your ear buds to make sure no one else can hear what you're listening to?

people with a mental illness are not lazy. they have to face an internal battle everyday. and we all know loosing the battle is not an option. we literally have the biggest, most important job possible. keeping ourselves sane and alive.

i love you and hope you are having an awesome day

i’m a young kid with really terrible death anxiety. for the first time, i’m visiting my grandfather’s grave. grabbed some ice cream on the way... feeling very nervous but wish me luck, going with a smile for him! :)

does anyone use their phone excessively for hours to distract their brain?

i stopped existing to the world for three years after graduating college. last week, i posted about attending my first full time job interview. i wasn’t expecting anything, i was proud of myself for being brave. tonight, they offered me the position. i am a person again. i am real. i exist.

i did it.
i fucking did it. i have extremely bad driving anxiety and i have been stressing about this trip for months and today was the day. i drove 2 hours on the highway!!!! i went like 100 km/hr!!!!! and then 2 hours back (in the dark!!!) !!!!!!!i bought myself a whole pizza when i got there and smashed it bc i fucking deserved that shit hahahahahit’s literally 1:45 am and i’m so fucking happy. if you’re reading this and you’re too scared to do something, do it. on the other side of fear is freedom. i feel like i just beat a boss level. good night guys, sending you all good vibes.edit: thank you so much for all your lovely comments and to whoever gave me gold! i’ve posted about this issue on this sub for a while and i’m so grateful for all the support i’ve received. wishing you all the best. 
does anyone feel depressed that their anxiety has kept them from experiencing major parts of a normal life?
i barely went out with friends when i was in high school. always heard about my friends going out to parties, but i never went to one myself. in university, i avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. at the time, i didn't realize i had anxiety. but now, when i look back, knowing that i had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that i missed out on socializing and parties. even though deep down i feel like i would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. not sure if that makes sense or not. it's sort of feeling like i wish i could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that i probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if i had had the opportunity to socialize more.
[update] after almost canceling a job interview due to anxiety, i forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!
i got an offer!!!!!!i went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but i did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! higher pay, almost double the pto, amazing benefits... i’m just so excited!!!! i know on my first day i’m gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish i stayed in my comfort zone but i don’t even care because this just proves to me that if i push through those nasty feelings i really can do anything!!thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. this has been a huge life changing step for me and it’s amazing to be able to share it with all of y’all.edit: i promise i’m done bragging on myself after this but i just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! i’m over the moon, i can’t believe i’m me and i did this haha. thank y’all, the support in this sub is unbelievable and i’m so glad these posts were able to motivate people. :) every single one of y’all has it in you!
anyone ever get a surge of anxiety whenever your phone rings? every time it goes off i just think “fuck. i’m in trouble”.

i saw a saying that read never get so comfortable in pain that you forget happiness is still an option
just thought someone might need this.
3 years ago i was terrified of driving and refused to drive on the highway. today here i am driving across the entire us!

i hope this can be helpful for those who get anxious. i’m still learning 

went and tried to help my neighbor start his car! pictured is exactly how i felt!

if you're reading this it means i did it
i'm really socially anxious and thinking about posting this is making it hard to breath and making me shake but i'm trying to get better and if you're reading this then it means i am taking a small step towards my goal and this is my first post so i'm even more anxious. i'm trying so hard from crying and deleting this post. i've probably wrote 50 different sentences and deleted them thinking it's not good enough and that people would be upset. i really don't want to but i got to try. it's been 15-20 minuets since i started to type all of this  and i'm really  scared on posting it. please don't be too hard on me... i'm sorry for  the mess of the post  but if you're reading this it means i did it and thank you for reading.
do you ever feel like people without an anxiety disorder have this magic i don't care button? like they can just choose not to be bothered by something?

so i'm iranian and i'm terrified right now.
woke up 8 times last night and at some point i just gave up on sleeping. i tried not to fallow the news and just focus on something else but there's nothing i can do. seriously what can you do when your country is on the edge of war and it's going to turn into another syria? not only that but i still haven't done my military service ( which is mandatory here ) and that could be how the regime is going to send me to war. which all of this is making me consider suicide. if i'm going to die, i don't want to be at a war, i don't want to see the horrors of war and the destruction of my country, family and friends. i don't want to experience the hunger... if anything is going to kill me it has to be myself. fuck all these politicians.
you know the anxiety is real when you always add an lol or haha to every text you send, for fear of thinking you are offending someone.

your mental health is more important than the test, the interview, the meeting, the family dinner and the grocery run. take care of yourself.
have a blessed day!❤
yo fuck anxiety

does anyone else say sorry as an impulse?
i say it even when i don't mean to. it's so freaking annoying and i need to break the habit
to you reading this i hope you have a nice day and i hope you get over your anxity and remember to never lose hope, you are strong. ❤
edit : thank you anonymous internet friend for my first gold ❤ edit 2 : the fact that i made more than 1k people around the world feel lil better is crazy idea to think about ❤
anyone else suffer from depression too and have to decide whether or not to drink coffee because it’s a choice between my anxiety being worse or being exhausted all day?
holy crap i didn’t think this would get this far up there, thanks everybody it’s good to know i’m not alone. i’m sorry you guys have to experience this too though, i wish i could answer all the comments but just know i’ve read them all and they’re all appreciated! this sub is a fantastic group of people.
hello! i hope you guys are having a nice day. this is my therapy bunny. his name is chicken! he helps when i have anxiety attacks. this is him in his banana beanie!

til actress kristen bell has struggled with and received treatment for depression and anxiety. she said, it's important for me to be candid about this so people in a similar situation can realize that they are not worthless and that they do have something to offer. : todayilearned

so yesterday i did a talk to a group of students regarding my battles with anxiety and depression...today they just offered me a job...they are willing to pay for my qualifications and offer me a position teaching mental health at their training centre ...you guys are my motivation ❤

how many of you guys lurk the anxiety subreddit but don't post/comment?
because, anxiety. this is my first post though, so...progress?
does anyone get so anxious about class that they don’t go, but then it makes your anxiety even worse because of the guilt from not going?

i went to groceries, i cleaned my appartment and i cooked myself a burger with potatoes for the first time in 3 months.
i just needed to tell anyone, i feel like i finally got my shit together for the first time in a long time.edit: holy sh, this thread blew up ! didn't expect that. i can't respond to everyone but thanks a lot for your support guys ! i had a cool day at work today and some of your comments were really awesome, thanks a lot ! i'll keep on doing me-stuff and having me-time as much as i can, starting today. and thanks for the 2 medals lol
does anyone else get overwhelmed and anxious as soon as they have a responsibility to fulfil (answering a text, an email, etc.)?
i’m going back to law school next week, and a bunch of communication from volunteering groups, clubs, friends, etc. have started up again. i feel like crawling under my covers every time i think about having to schedule a meeting or return a phone call to someone. it hasn’t ever been this bad before. i don’t even want to answer texts from my friends that are back in town, because that means we need to get together. ex: i had to send a mass email to a few organizations to see if they wanted to arrange a presentation with my volunteer group. i’ve already received a voicemail and an email in response. the idea of needing to respond and figure out logistics makes me body turn to stone. i just want to ignore it all and pretend i never heard back from anyone...does this happen to anyone else? do you snap out of it?
unclench your jaw
whoever needs this reminder :) i usually do
i’m anorexic and have several anxiety disorders and i went grocery shopping by myself for the first time in 6 months! ☺️

does anyone else replay their conversation in their heads and worry they said something that pissed the other person off?

climbing the panic attack mountain (art)

took a huge step. went to see a therapist today. had a panic attack while leaving went there crying and all. but i did go.
feeling completely drained now. am cocooning in my room now.wow i love this response and all the encouragement and love. thank you all. i am trying to respond to every comment. but it gets overwelhming. it will take time but i am reading every comment.
best explanation i've read about how dealing with both depression and anxiety feels... [x-post r/depression]

my biggest fear is that my anxiety will always keep me in my safe zone causing me to live a life of mediocrity that i will one day really regret.
currently trying to tackle this issue but its my biggest challenge. 
anxiety isn’t cute, anxiety is thinking someone died because they haven’t messaged you in a day.
either that or they hate you. 
understand this: you can sound confident & have anxiety. you can look healthy but feel like shit. you can look happy & be miserable inside. you can be good looking & feel ugly. so be kind, because every person is fighting a battle you know nothing about

skipping classes for my mental health...which impacts my grades...which impacts my mental health.
✨ college ✨
psa: never let a bad day/week/month convince you that you haven't made any progress. you're better off now than you were a year ago, and you will persevere further.

anxiety didn't win, i'm graduating high school in 4 hours!

anyone else get anxiety when you notice the slightest change in how someone speaks/treats you

30 minutes after i finished drawing this, i had a major panic attack. did i just draw my anxiety?

i always want to post in this subreddit but i know i’ll feel like a failure if i don’t get upvotes.
does this happen to anyone else? i actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety, and i know i could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more. but there’s some silly irony in me thinking “well what if this gets ignored? what if people think this is dumb or invalid?”. even right now as i type this i think “oh yeah this is so witty and meta, this will definitely get me to the top of the sub” which is so in line with every obsession i have about being special, being great, being loved, etc — and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning. edit: ha, this blew up, how poetic. the joy or validation i feel from the upvotes doesn’t match the negativity i would have felt if it went unnoticed, which is good to know! you all are wonderful and this is a great community. i’ve come a long way with my anxiety and i’m working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me, so i hope to see you all here again. ❤️❤️❤️
i just called into a pizza place!!!
i'm still shaking. making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety. i asked whether it's not too late to have it delivered into my area. person said no but that i'd have it better to order it online anyway. so it was a shorter and less complicated phone call than i was preparing for but that doesn't change the fact that i did it! i dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! eat a dick, anxiety.edit: i make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! this literally made my whole month. your guys' support, advice and kind words on this post have been overwhelming. i did not expect it to blow up so much but i'm grateful it did. i'm so motivated and inspired by your words that i'm now less scared to push myself even further. thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 
does anyone else suppress their personality when speaking to new people and end up being a boring shell of a person and having really boring conversations because you don’t bring any life to them
like, you won’t make the jokes that you think of making or use any slang that you normally use. i always start to speak like a tv presenter for some reason, all bland and weirdly emotionless and, like i said, no personality. plus i’ll laugh way too much at jokes that weren’t that funny and it’s just ... weird. idk if this makes sense 
anxiety

trusting your gut feeling is a lot more difficult when you have anxiety.
i often hear that when your gut tells you something, it's usually right. but how does this work when you're anxious about every little thing? i never know if it's a true warning or just my anxiety making something out of nothing. it's like my gut is crying wolf all the time. 
sending everyone hugs tonight.
you know who you are. you’re me, obsessively refreshing the worldnews and politics thread because you can’t sleep and you can’t stop thinking about it.    and then you’re thinking about australia and the fires, or the flu going around, or how your stomach has been in knots today and you didn’t eat dinner and now taking a shower seems impossible because there’s so much happening and you need to know what’s going to happen next.    i want you to know you’re not alone, no matter what happens. i may not know you, but i am right there with you, and we can share this together. no matter what happens.    sending you all so many hugs.    ---    dear everyone,    i am writing to let you know i am reading each and every single one of your comments. i made this post because i saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. truth be told, i am scared too. i'm scared everyday. that's life with anxiety. sometimes it is really small and it feels like i can just ignore it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.    i recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided i would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.    whatever the case, i want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. it is good to know we're not alone. there are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. i want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.    >the life of man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. one by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent death. very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. and so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.  - bertrand russell, a free man's worship
decided to face my fears head on! went on my first flight since getting ptsd. was quite concerned about how i’d cope. but used a new technique. not so big and scary anymore are ya panic attacks!! didn’t panic and feeling so much more confident for the next trip!

i'm sure this makes its rounds but still a good share nonetheless 

im not stupid, im not unintelligent, im not slow, im just anxious.
thats all i wanted to say really.
this gave me a chuckle today, hope it helps you :)

my moms view on anxiety...

the side of anxiety most people don’t understand.
started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that i’m required to wear. go to put one on and it doesn’t fit, none of them do. now i’m having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. i woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure i was ready. now i’m sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don’t fit. anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when i go back in. my body hurts physically and i feel nauseous over this. all over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn’t work that way. this sucks ☹️
you are strong for getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. you are brave for doing things even though they scare you or make you anxious.
and you are amazing for trying and holding on no matter how hard life gets.
i impulsively asked a girl out yesterday in person. she told me she had a boyfriend but i'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.
she's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. i kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and i'd get shut down. she was super polite and it was all good. i imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time i want to do this. i was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. sitting here the next day, i can't believe i did that but i'm proud of myself. just had to tell someone! thanks guys.edit: just to add what was going through my mind at the time. my psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. i kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but i considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. it's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). if you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. if you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. i'm no psychologist so that was probably a c+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.edit 2: holy moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. you all are awesome. thank you.
my anxiety has been reaching new peaks lately, so thought i'd try out one of those adult coloring books. it has literally been years since i sat down and colored, but i think i've found a new form of meditation.

i have terrible phone anxiety but my favorite aunt/ my moms best friend passed and they spelled my moms name wrong in the obituary, she was so upset she didn’t even want a copy of it so i called and asked if hey could fix it on their website at least and they agreed. shaking but happy

got a tattoo of a queue to represent me managing my anxiety; first thought in, first thought out, one at a time.

today my wife and i start marriage counseling. i have hurt her over the years because of my anxiety. i hope i can elevate her and be the best husband i can be. wish us luck.

come a long way! at a sit down restaurant by myself! easy decision 

i called the suicide hotline and the operator was rude to me.
i just posted this over in r/mental health and i thought i’d post here too.during and extreme panic attack/depressive episode, i was feeling like i was at the end of my rope, and i didn’t know what to do so i called the suicide hotline.right off the bat, she sounded like i was bothering her. absolutely no compassion in her voice. she sound like she couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. i started babbling and she interrupted me and said “ma’am are you going to hurt yourself or not”me: umm...her: if you are, you can go to a crisis center. there’s one at so and so hospital.me: umm i don’t have insurance.her: well you can just payme: i... don’t know if i want to go thereher: .... so are you trying to harm yourself or *not*?at that point i just hung up. she was making my anxiety worse.  so i called the depression hotline. the man who answered was very kind and gentle, listened to me cry, comforted me, and gave me advice on what to do next time i was feeling like this.so i guess the point of this post is there are other numbers to call when you feel like you’re out of options. and... don’t give up!edit to add:the depression hotline number i called was local to my state, and i’m not sure if there is a national one but [this website](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/mental-health/depression/related/depression-hotlines/#gref) has a list of local numbers you can call!here are some other helpful links provided by other redditors:hope this helps someone!
been away from home on an extended work detail and my anxiety and depression have been getting really bad. i've been trying to use photoshop again (been awhile, 10+ years) in hopes it would substitute for some of my more unhealthy habits. i just wanted to share with some people who share my plight

i avoid my responsibilities because of my anxiety, but avoiding my responsibilities makes me anxious.

does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?
i want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.i've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but i feel like it's messed up my brain. i can't think clear, i don't have interest in things like i used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.i feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and i don't have anything important to say. hell, i don't even know how to act around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  my brain is always on , it's exhausting. i obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it? sorry if this was long and venty i just feel trapped in my head! *takes brain out and throws it out the window* thank you :-)edit: wow thank you everyone for all of your comments. it means a lot that we can share and relate here, to know we are not alone on this. 
if you need a laugh - i drew a map of depression and anxiety

who else gets really nervous when someone is in a bad mood?

does anyone else feel like their brain just literally searches for any reason to worry?
i swear if the source of my anxiety gets resolved, i just immediately find something else to worry about. i just want to know what it feels like to not worry sometime 
i feel good right now. i may or may not feel good tomorrow, but goddamnit i feel good and in control today and i'm proud of that

please forgive your mind/body for the anxiety, it's doing the best it can given the circumstances.
i think i needed to hear that today, so i thought it might help you too.&#x200b;a week later edit:wow i didn't expect this to get so much attention! i wish i saw this sooner. i usually come here when i'm feeling anxious and tonight... well, tonight has been kind of a doozie. thank you all, seeing all these responses has actually stopped me from shaking so badly. i love you all for your strength and kindness <3 i appreciate the comments and upvotes (and the gold goodness me!), i'm really glad i could help someone else. this stuff sucks. you've helped me a lot tonight, thank you <3
anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?
idk if this is the right place to post this, but i felt like i needed to get it off my chest. every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, i feel like i can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. however, after a day, everything comes crashing down and i feel like shit, almost like i didn't deserve that boost of confidence. it has just been a viscous cycle. update: i just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said i may have bipolar ii. thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. i hope you all get the help you need as well
i've been struggling with anxiety lately. wanted to draw how i felt and how i see my own anxiety.

had anxiety about going to the post office to ship a package, forced myself to go and realized anxiety just makes everything sound worse than it really is and i’m proud of myself for going!
i know this sounds so like something so basic but lately my anxiety has been really bad preventing me from doing things i had to ship an item that someone bought off me online and i kept putting it off this week because i was too anxious to go to the post office and wasn’t sure what i would do once i got there.my boyfriend told me that i should try to go because this was something i needed to do since i already got paid for the item. sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you’ll be fine about a certain situationonce i got back i felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and i was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about! i just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won’t know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!
if you’re looking for a sign, this is it. everything is going to be okay.
just putting some positivity out there.now, take a deep breath and if you’re holding tension in your shoulders, drop it. relax. smile!
does anyone else have trouble falling asleep because every fricking thing you ever did wrong keeps popping in your head and you are literally ripping yourself apart for all the wrongful things you did months, even years ago. it's been consuming me lately.

most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.
a stigma that i’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. this is something that needs changing. it is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (i had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when i struggled with low mood i was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ this is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. of course it’s not all bad, i’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. 
a monday reminder

after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, i forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!
i was so nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. interviews are a major trigger for me, i almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and i’m really not very good at them. on top of that, it was for a bilingual role and i knew i’d have to speak german and i was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that i would totally bomb and embarrass myself. i was so close to canceling. i made a million excuses to my friends in family about why i didn’t really want the job anyway so i might as well not go. i am so, so glad i didn’t. i experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! i wasn’t stammering and awkward like i usually am and i was really confident in all of my answers. best of all, when they brought in the german dude so i could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s never been impressed by anyone’s german before!!!i never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time i do. i really really really hope i get the job (the office is unreal, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if i don’t, i’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like i always do.just had to share because i feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!edit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it’s so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) i will update once i hear back about the job.
fuck anxiety
that is all 
a friendly reminder.
you're not dying. those aches and pains you're feeling? normal. those muscle spasms in your chest and all around your body? normal. feeling like your heart/chest is being squeezed? also normal. feeling like you can't breathe/aren't getting enough air/like something is stuck in your throat? normal. your heart is pounding and occasionally skipping? you guessed it, also normal. those feelings of dread and like everything is gonna go wrong? yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, we're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. we feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome. these things may be scary and uncomfortable, but they won't be the death of us. we've felt them numerous times before and haven't dropped dead then, we won't drop dead now. stay strong everyone.edit: r/healthanxiety is a great subreddit for people that struggle with these things on a daily basis, for those of you unaware of it's existence. ❤️
i look at this when i need a little boost

i hope everyone who reads this has a great day. you matter and are important.
dont let anyone tell you different.edit: wow thanks for the upvotes and my first silver. you are all awesome. even the people who down voted i still hope you had a great day. love you all.
does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?
i get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. my stomach will hurt and occasionally i'll get heartburn. only when i'm highly anxious.i just wondered if anyone else gets this and can't think of anywhere i'd be more comfortable asking....edit - wow, this blew up. i had no idea this was such a common thing!
does anyone else’s anxiety cause them to speak really fast and finish people’s sentences, leading to really weird conversations that don’t last long?
personally, it’s like i can never just relax and let the conversation flow naturally. sometimes i mumble my replies as well like i’m not confident enough to make my words audible, so that’s also pretty weird. it’s like i know i’m being weird but i physically cannot stop. 
i painted this using the titles of some posts here.
i love you guys, okay?
does anyone else get pee anxiety? like, when you know you won't be able to use a restroom for a few hours, you get really anxious about it and end up thinking about needing it the whole time?
most of the time happens on longer trips or exams. it also usually ends in actually having to pee cause i couldn't get it out of my mind.
after four years of suicidal ideation, depression, and the worst anxiety i’ve ever known, i graduated college today. progress is possible, for anyone who needs to hear that right now.
college is undoubtedly the hardest thing i’ve done so far in my life, and there were a lot of times i imagined giving in before making it this far. i must admit it was very surreal being able to experience my ceremony after i was so convinced i wouldn’t make it so many times before. shout out to all my fellow graduates, and to those still in university (or anywhere else in school/life) just know that if i can do it, anyone can. progress is possible, just make sure you’re around to see it.
does anybody else's anxiety get soothed by rain and/or stormy weather?

just ride it out. this too will pass. it always does. stop worrying. let it go. breathe in and breathe out. peace and love. my mood is ok. i'm ok.

does anyone else hate when they start talking about something they’re passionate about, but then start to feel like they’re being annoying and then stop talking about it?
to explain, i used to live in a decent sized city, and i found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. anytime i was feeling down or negative i would just hop in my car and go. the drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time i got home i was usually in a much better headspace. i just really loved that drive. when explaining the drive to a girl i was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. i have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, i proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. “does she actually give a shit about this?”“you look stupid just stop”the usual. i then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that i had forgot. this is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. thanks for letting me vent guys.
to anyone who needs to be reminded- one day you're going to break out of this and enjoy your life the way you've always wanted to.

this is helping me get through what's going on in the world right now... and staying off social media.

is anyone else’s life just surviving work each day so they can get home and collapse in bed and then repeat
basically all mine is and has been for a long time. 
today i turned thirty and instead starting the day with tequila shots i started cleaning and organizing my house... something anxiety has been blocking me from doing... and right now i feel amazing

does anyone else get annoyed that the symptoms caused by anxiety are causing more anxiety, but your brain won't accept it's anxiety?

i take my hat off to people who experience anxiety as a daily thing. you guys are true warriors
i get anxiety. i get a full on attack every 4/5 months that debilitates me for a couple of days. i feel for those of you dealing with this fucked up condition in a daily basis. i honestly don’t know how you do it. feeling like this day in day out. i take my hat off to you guys ❤️
one of the most annoying things about panic attacks: no matter how many times you've had identical symptoms and came out fine, they're still just as terrifying.
double annoying: because we're always fine after a panic attack, a panic attack is actually a sign that everything is fine and you're not in any danger.but its still terrifying every time. i hate panic attacks.
i challenge you all to give me five minutes of your time.
just in case nobody has told you in a while, unclench your teeth.  let your tongue come down from the roof of your mouth.  relax your shoulders.  take some deep breaths through your nose, hold them for a few seconds, and release them.  now, just breath until you’re able to sink in to your bed or your seat with your eyes closed.
my fitbit today told me i had 70 active minutes. i had none. my fitbit doesn't know i have mad anxiety that makes my heart race as if i'm running for my life. silly fitbit.

todays 365 days clean of self harm
i did it, i finally hit a year of being clean. its been really hard but i finally did it. now that im a year clean i can finally get my scars covered with tattoos that iv been wanting. i made a promise that if i was clean for a year i could get them covered! no i just gotta start saving. this is a massive step for me. im proud of myself
everytime your anxiety gives you shit, remember, it's fake news.

my best friend became a mass murderer. i’ve never been the same since that day.
so, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. it’s been several years, about 6, and while i’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   first off for context, i’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. it was a pretty big story in my state and really big on youtube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  [mr. anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       anyways, i woke up today with a comment from a video on youtube that i posted on. it was a web documentary that someone did on him, and i thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. of course, this really didn’t help, and i ended up super anxious. people taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in youtube comments.   a little backstory: i grew up with trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when i was 22. i had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. he cut contact with me around then which i’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   when i say we were best friends, i mean we were best friends. i spent the night at his house 3 times a week. we had all night wow gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. his family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. i was in his first ever youtube video, and i continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. when he moved to his grandparents house in hempstead, i visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. he filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever i came back from college to visit. we definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. i didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and i didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  the thing about trey is he always was pretty secretive. if i ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. don’t get me wrong, i knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. i would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   when the murders happened, i didn’t even know what to do. my girlfriend at the time comforted me, but i was just...numb. i literally didn’t feel anything. then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” and that was when i had my first panic attack. i’m talking full on “i’m gonna die oh my god.” this went on for nearly 2 days. constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. i couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like i was going insane. i actually packed up and drove to dallas (i lived in austin) to go to my moms because i didn’t know what to do, and she had a xanax prescription and gave me one and i slept for nearly 20 hours.   i’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. i learned it’s caused by ptsd from the events. i have no health insurance so i can’t really go to therapy unless i foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. no one really understands. my dad thinks i should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! a family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. i’m kind of in a panicked mindset because i got triggered by all the memories of trey. it’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when i get into this mindset. it feels like i can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. if anyone has any questions i’d love to answer, but i’d also love some advice and support. thanks for reading.   edit; everyone that responded thank you so so much. you have no idea how much this means to me. i’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. joy because i realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because i feel i don’t deserve that compassion.  yes i know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. like others have said, i feel i may have a bit of survivors guilt because i learned i was actually a target of his, and i read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with texas rangers. supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. i know that friend was me. i remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and i remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha i got you” thing that he loved doing.   anyways, i’m trying to respond to everyone, but i work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). so if i haven’t responded yet, i will definitely try. i’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. 
does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? like you can’t be at peace until you get it over with?
i get this everyday of my life. i can never live in the moment. i’ll be having fun for a second and then i’ll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? if so, how do you deal with it? how do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?
does anybody else crave a day home alone, but your anxiety/depressions also gets worse home alone?
i’m sorry for that horribly constructed sentence. i’m a weird split between extroverted and introverted, but i love having a day or two to myself to just do whatever i’d like in the comfort of my cozy home. however, my anxiety makes it so hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing ‘relaxing’ things when i should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground. i end up crying, getting nothing done, and also not being able to relax, so then i’ve wasted a day and now i feel 100x worse about myself. does this happen to anyone else? edit: thank you all for your replies. it definitely makes me feel less alone in all this. you guys are the best. 
anyone else have constant anxiety rather than attacks?
i hear a lot of people with anxiety talk about having anxiety attacks or panic attacks, but it’s never really been that way with me. i just seem to constantly be on edge with everything, even small stuff, and every once in a while i’ll have “waves” of increased anxiety for a few days. does anyone else have mild or moderate stress at all times instead of actual anxiety attacks?
if you felt awkward today, i want to congratulate you...
for trying your best.for making the phone call.for answering the phone.for not staying at home.for putting in the effort.for trying something new.for reaching out.for asking for what you want.for taking a risk, any risk at all.it may seem like a failure today, but these little experiences will pay dividends in your future. don’t give up!
be gentle with yourself today, you're doing the best you can. <3

does anyone else constantly feel like the pity friend and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?
this is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. i see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious i am and how much i try to stay out of everyone's way. people are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something i naturally do in platonic relationships, even though i have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than i am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is i'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice i am and they don't want to overstep.i just always notice that i am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which i am to some degree, but i think i give off the impression that i am way more than is accurate). i just often end up feeling that i'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and i somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.i'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically i'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. they're very nice, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. i don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. i just always feel like i'm not in on things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. and i always feel like people look down on me and think i'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits.
if you want to say thank you, don't say sorry.

this time last year i couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today i talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.
i’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. i was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. i couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. it got so bad i was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. i began to see a therapist who did cbt 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. now i work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, i drive all the time, go on dates, and i start school to be an emt monday. today i was assisting during a gastric bypass. i was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where i have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. it wasn’t the first time i assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. the room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. my mask started to fog up and i was sweating, but i can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so i was literally trapped. then i remembered everything i had learned, i started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. i thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. the best part? the doctor told me i did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. the point of this post? to look at where i was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. now i live a very full life and do things that i want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. you can improve and get your life back. if i did it, any of you can do it. the biggest advice i can give is please, get help. i was terrified but it saved my life. i still go to therapy once a month, and i’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. i hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing i’ve ever done, and i failed at times but didn’t stop trying. no one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. i wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and i believe in you. if anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my pms are always open to help anyone! 
keep getting brainzaps, sometimes so bad all i can do is grip my head. they're so hard to explain so i tried to draw it.

i don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives
i (23f) am american. i don't know if it is just me, but i am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until i can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). my current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. i never feel like i am rested enough or that i have enough time to do the fun things i like to do. i don't feel like i have hobbies anymore, and i certainly don't have very many friends. i feel like i have to spend all of my free time keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.i don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and i especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. i think of all the things i want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and i don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. i don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. i'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. i promised myself i would see europe before i hit 25 and i don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.i get stuck in this spiral of am i just lazy and start to get worried that it is only me. maybe, somehow, i am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. sometimes i feel ungrateful. my life is fine - i have a roof over my head and food to eat. i am privileged in terms of the type i work i do. sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. that's better than a lot of people can say. can someone tell me it isn't just me? or maybe give me a reality check that it is? i just don't know how i can keep this up for another 45 years. i'm so tired.edit: i've taken some time to go through all the comments (though i didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! it's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and i think i have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. thank you all so much.
yesterday i had no attacks! let's go baby!
first time in a while. jesus, this feels fantastic.
does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?
i do it periodically 
posting to reddit is scary
i'm scared to post anything here. i can't count the number of times i've had an entire post/comment written out, and i delete it because i get scared. getting downvoted is terrifying to me. if i have an opinion that might be umpopular, delete. it's not that i don't know how to express myself, i'm just scared to.
for every upvote, i will read one aol instant messenger chat log from my high school days.
i just found a folder of my old chat longs from age 12 to about 20. there's hundreds of files here.i already think so much about the embarrassing shit i did back in my teenage years. why not ruin any chance or repairing my social anxiety by reading every single one and committing them to long term memory? it'll be like suicide for my sanity i already found one chat where i told one of my online-only female friends that i loved her... i was 13.
does anyone else get this sense of dread everytime you're home because you gotta go back to work the next day?
i always get this dreaded feeling everytime i am home. at work i feel fine, no anxiety but everytime i come home i get anxiety about the next day.even if it's friday i start dreading monday. i don't even dislike my job that much but i think it may have to do with very bad job experiences with not so nice employers/colleagues.anyone else get this feeling? i am diagnosed with unspecified phobic anxiety mild to moderate.
some late night feelings being drawn by a sad child. i'm feeling better day by day. hope everyone will feel the love <3

hey when was the last time you took a deep breath? why don't you take one now?
in and out. you are alive after all :)
having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it’s mania because it’s so unusual.
honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know i’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) i’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. but i’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. i’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like i was going crazy haha. it goes to show i’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  i feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. after talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. and was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... i was convinced i was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! i’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of cbt i’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! i’m allowed to be happy. i’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. 
today, at 22 years old and after years of panic disorder and anxiety, i applied to college for the first time.
i dropped out of high school at 17 due to consistent and debilitating panic attacks and thought i would never be able to go back. after two years in an academic upgrading course i am finally able to apply to college with a 90% average. feeling so fucking proud. don’t give up. ever.
does anyone else think up scenarios of how things will play out and get extremely worked up and anxious about it?
any help or advice would be great
can someone wish me a happy birthday?
i don't really have any friends in school or in general because i'm very anxious and socially awkward so therefore nobody wished me a happy birthday today, so i was wondering could anyone wish me a happy birthday here, it would be really appreciated!thanks.update: i went bowling and had a nice day in the end, everyone's kind words, support and advice really made it a lot brighter! thanks to everyone!
does hearing the sentence i have bad news make your anxiety shoot through the roof?
i *hate* when someone tells me that they have bad news. my stomach drops and all kinds of terrible scenarios run through my head. and 99% of the time the bad news ends up being something trivial like the grocery store is out of garlic powder. i wish people didn't use that phrase so lightly. 
me...always

anyone else take their headphones off their heads every 5 seconds to make sure they're not loud and someone else is hearing them?
and feel like the person next to you is annoyed by the loud music but choosing not to tell you to turn it down?edit: omg guysi'm fairly new to reddit so this is exciting for me! i'm not actually diagnosed with anxiety, but i still feel anxious and think the thoughts most of you think. so thank you for so many upvotes! i did not expect this! 
it took me two trips to grocery stores and driving around for thirty minutes, but i finally got myself to go in and get food. i wish this wasn't something people would tell me to be proud of for trying and succeeding. this is my life
no hate to people that do feel pride in getting over this. i do feel like you should. i just wish i wasn't in this situation
i have anxiety and i'm terrified of confrontation so i create arguments in my head where i can say what i really feel. does anyone else relate to this or am i just weird?
i'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because i'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. every time i get even into the smallest of debates, i'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if i didn't cause it or even if i'm right. i hate making people upset so i'd rather admit i'm wrong (even if i'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. i always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where i say what i actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because i'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. am i just spineless or is this something that others feel?
this girl at work today just knew i was in anxiety mode and gave me a hug and said let it wash away or something like that and it felt so good. then i told her like yo that was really nice of you i was feeling a lot lately. and she gave me another hug and said i know how it is or something like that

i had a party last night and didn't have any panick attack! i'm really proud of myself

does anybody get anxiety because of too much empathy? i feel terrible for random people i see alone or for whatever random reason.
edit: wow i really expected to be roasted for calling myself empathetic. i had no idea so many people felt this way too and i feel much less alone. wishing everyone peace
you are going to be okay.
even though you feel scared, you are safe.you are not alone.you do not have to be afraid.you will get better again.you are loved.you are in control.you are not crazy.you are doing your best.being strong doesn’t feel strong. the hard things aren’t easy.
do any of you ever wake up with that tough feeling around your chest, like weight, almost like guilt, and it even climbs up to your throat and whatever you do you just can't get rid of it? feeling like you did something wrong, but you didn't.

to me, social anxiety is walking to the other side of your office building, to use the bathroom nobody knows exists, just to avoid having to talk to your coworkers while washing your hands.

does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off
i live around koreans who think sighing is rude, and other people have mentioned that i sigh a lot especially when i am stressed, but it doesn't mean i am upset necessarily or displeased with the person i am with, i just do that to help myself think more clearly and get rid of the anxious feeling/dread in my chest and stomach. it usually works for a bit and then i have to do it again a few minutes later. i was not conscious that i did this until i moved to korea and got scolded for doing this. not doing it is almost unbearable physiologically though - i feel like i have to do it to release the sensation in my chest and stomach. am i the only one?
i got accepted to college!!
i got my first acceptance letter today!!! high school was a pretty shit experience for me. anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. it got so bad that i had to get home tutors for two years because i couldn’t even manage to leave my house. for awhile i considered dropping out because i literally believed it was impossible to continue. but i couldn’t be more proud right now. i’m in school for senior year, i will be attending my graduation ceremony, and i am going to college!!! hell yeah!!! so if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if i can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.edit: thank you to everyone who took time to share your experiences and congratulations. it means so much and it’s encouraging to no end. you all are such lovely people
i hate that even when i am being rational in my head and know i'm not *actually* upset about something, there's nothing i can do to not have the physical feeling of anxiety. my chest tightening, having a hard time breathing, the nausea.
like wtf if i can soothe myself in my brain and know i'm good why can't my body agree !!!!!!!
after bombing at my working interview last week due to panic attacks, i got a second chance with an even better business in a similar role today. i decided to have fun with the interview and it was low-stress and anxiety. i got the job.
i am seriously over the moon right now!  this is my dream job and i can't believe i scored it!  i followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a fake it till you make it approach to all interactions with this employer.  i made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  my anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that i actually have a full time job, 2) that i'll be doing what i love, and 3) it's less than 15 minutes from my new home.what will i be doing, you ask?  working with dogs!  i love, love, love dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  i'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (i love giving them baths!).i feel the complete *opposite* of what i felt going into that second interview at last week.  in every way.  i'm confident, too...  that's rare for me.  thanks, anxiety.  seriously, though...  thank you, r/anxiety!  i approached this opportunity today using the tips and advice you gave me...  and it worked beautifully!i start tomorrow at 11 am.  wish me luck!!!  :d
i am incredibly lonely all the time, but i feel so relieved when i don’t have to be around ppl. anybody else experience something similar?
edit:i’m not sure if anyone will see this edit, but thank you all for commenting on this post. reading all your comments has been comforting, but also heartbreaking knowing there are so many of us that struggle with something that seems so simple(being around other humans) i went to bed last night feeling very defeated as i gave into my anxiety yet again and bailed on a social event to stay home and be alone. however, i woke up this morning to see all these responses and they honestly made me emotional because now i see so many people struggling with this same thing! there is probably ppl even in my own apartment building that feel this way and i can’t reach them! i can’t find them because of my anxiety holding me back. this viscous cycle has to be broken.... we are weakest alone. we need each other. we can not accept isolation. 
anyone else get random cringe flashbacks?
i keep getting overwhelmed with thoughts of embarrassing things i did like 5 years ago. it comes with a wave of anxiety and the strong urge to crawl under a table or punch myself for doing something so stupid, and it's like i'm reliving all the cringe.
telling somebody with anxiety to stop worrying is like telling somebody with epilepsy to stop having a seizure.
saw this quote today and it needs to be shared.
anyone else just likes to retreat to bed when things go bad?
i just love laying in bed i normaly should be doing other stuff but bed makes me comfortableit’s mostly during times i have to go out and do stuff my body just says nope and i want to cuddle down in bed and watch something relaxing.
does anyone else just want to sleep, cause you can't feel anxious if you're not conscious?
only when i'm asleep can i completely ignore all the body sensations (heart palpitations, tension, etc.).
if you’re reading this, i hope you have an amazing day.
struggling with the extreme highs and lows of anxiety and trying to push through by beginning my day with meditation and a positive note. if you are reading this i hope you have a good day, focus on the good, and know a lot of people care and love you. thanks for being here for me the past couple of months. 
anxiety paradox; i don’t wanna die but i don’t wanna live like this

does anyone else stay up all night because they're nervous about the next day?
i don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower. idk how to explain it but i stay up till like 7am every night because i don't want the next day to be here yet. i also stay up because i feel like i have so much to do before going to sleep but then i end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?
fuck anxiety

i just want to tell someone that i'm trying.
i may not succeed but i'm trying.
today i made appointments for the dentist, eye dr, and physical therapist!!!! it was very draining and i had to get a little drunk to do it but i did it lol
small steps! now i just have to remove the alcohol from the equation.edit: wow thanks so much for all the love and kind words! i love that we can all support each others small victories, and i'm glad i can share my excitement here with fellow humans who understand how i feel.
anyone’s anxiety so bad that they sometimes question whether or not they actually have anxiety or if you’re making it up?

anxiety means constantly trying to figure out whether that feeling in your gut telling you to abort mission! is real and important and should be listened to, or whether it's irrational catastrophizing that should be confronted and ignored.
am i setting myself up for disaster? or is my overthinking and constant questioning what's setting me up for disaster?
in case you need this today
* you are not a failure.* you are not a waste of space.* you are loved.* you are wanted.* i believe in you.* you got this.
i get anxious because i feel like no matter what i do i could be doing something better with my time so i end up doing nothing at all
literally, nothing. reddit, ring a few friends, rarely go out and i'm unemployed. i'm 30 and i feel like a piece of garbage
i just got fired on my first day and i don't know what to do
i have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. i just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as i am typing this. this was my first real job since i finished school in may last year. so today was my first day and it all started really bad. every bread and vegetable has its own number which i have to type into the cash register. i don't know any of them so i have to look everything up on a piece of paper. that takes a while and i'm not really comfortable with that cash register as i never used something like that before. it took me quite some time to get through each customer and i often had to call another worker to come help me. the line at my register got bigger and bigger. we have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. then there was that older gentleman, i accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, i apologized and called for a coworker. the man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, i didn't know what to do. the other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow i am. at that point i was close to crying and i got a panic attack. finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that i need to pack my stuff and leave. so yea, i don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. i'm lost, i can't even have a normal job for a day. i hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and i'm still pretty nervous about everything.edit: thank you for your kind words, i really appreciate it. i called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place i likeedit 2: wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. i've read all of them and i am speechless. also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, i appreciate it very much. i don't really know what to say, this community is so kind. thank you 
currently in a busy resturant eating by myself not giving a fuck
....small steps
when you’re so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high
i’ve been feeling very calm and relaxed recently, and because i was so accustomed to confusion and worry, mainly due to not having a clue how to behave socially and being fearful of having a meltdown whenever i’m at work and people all talk at me at once, being in such a calm state felt like, to me, i was high. as in, stoned or dosed up on benzos. i should mention i didn’t actually take anything. who else has noticed this? it made me realise how intrusive and disruptive anxiety actually is, and that despite letting it exist, it’s way too much of a plastic bag over my head to ignore, which is why i am going to make more of an effort to counter it instead of living with it. 
i got my driver’s license!!
after a whole night of worrying myself, and crying i actually past my test!! i’m so happy :))).edit: thank you all for your congratulations. it helps me so much to know that i’m not alone with dealing with anxiety. i wish you all the best, i’ve made sure to read every comment.
does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?
i recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in high school, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). these moments were ongoing and humiliating - i would almost always play into the joke too. i never thought i was popular, but i never realized how big of a loser i was during those years. all of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. i graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. nonetheless, i'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. since hs, i had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these hs thoughts. has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?
when you notice your mental health declining, do this:
do one small thing that brings you peace. take a shower, text a loved one, step outside. one little step is all you need to remind yourself that this is not permanent.&#x200b;hope y'all have a great day!&#x200b;edit: sorry if i didn't reply to everyone, sometimes i get overwhelmed by the many comments i receive.
anxiety is thinking everyone and no one cares about you at the same time

[humour] how we were made

had anxiety for years and i finally plucked up enough courage to apply for a job and i got it, i am now building up money to move to london, fuck anxiety and depression will not take my life
been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. there’s been many times i  contemplated suicide.the other day i just thought fuck it i’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere i can feel more happy and fulfilled.still not out of the woods yet but i’m trying given the terrible circumstances.of course i am anxious and scared still of the uncertainty, i hear the horrible voice saying ‘everything will fail’ ‘nothing will work out for you’london will be a fresh start for me, whilst i’m at it i might even change my name and identity lol
ryan reynolds opens up about his lifelong battle with anxiety

hey everyone i'm anxious as fuck but have a good weekend anyway okay?
good god i'm tense as fuck. edit: i guess i just had to put this somewhere. it kinda helped in a weird way
anyone else stumble or mispronounce their words when they get anxious?
i’ve had this problem ever since i was young. tips on how to work on this. 
does anyone else's stomach get messed up by anxiety?
i've been crazy stressed this week and have been getting a lot of stomach aches. then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. at this point i'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if i'm constipated lol. though i'm more inclined to say it's anxiety because the pain seems to vanish the moment i stop feeling anxious, and then comes back when i start thinking about it again. no fun :(
do you ever feel like you have to tell someone how you feel, to get it out, but you also feel like you’re a burden to them, and then when you’ve done it, you feel guilty?

i think this adequately describes what i go through every single day.

a painting about how anxiety feels

it took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.
i only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. my mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. i've had depressive bouts but every time i heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like hmmm. not me. &#x200b;i though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. i thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. i thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. i thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. my intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that i never thought twice about the rationale behind it. i have adhd as well and when i thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when i got my adderall prescription, i wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. i was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than i used to.&#x200b;two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. i had aches in my chest for days on end. i was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. that happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. it dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. i did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe i've been anxious all my life and i just never realized it because i thought it was normal.&#x200b;&#x200b;i don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. i talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last friday. i don't know how much it will change me, i know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that i'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.edit: i just wanna say thank you all for the kind comments and well wishes! it's so nice to find other people who can relate to what you're going through. i wish you all the best in your own personal journeys as well. 
overcoming anxiety - robert ek

is there anyone else who feels like everyone finds them annoying?
your friends, your coworkers, your family...and all you're trying to do is be kind, be funny, express your love, try and be loved back.you're just trying to be less lonely. yet it seems like everyone can't stand you. either it's true or you're paranoid, neither is good for the mind and soul.
is there anyone else here that makes themselves physically sick (such as vomiting, heartburn, etc) because of their anxiety?
hi,i’m new here and i guess i just hope i’m not the only one that deals with this. i’m diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety.  i’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. the reason i have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  i’ve even been in group therapy (iop) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but i just feel  like i took a step back. yesterday, i was so stressed out about this that i caused myself to vomit even; i’ve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. is there anyone else who has this happen?
ugh. posting comments on reddit gives me anxiety ‍♀️
i thought i was being helpful with a comment but just saw i got downvoted -10 and now i feel awful update: omg guys waking up to all these upvotes, awards and comments has just completely obliterated all the awfulness i was feeling when i created this post. you are all the actual best 
doing a talk infront of 30 students tomorrow who are studying mental health and community services...got asked to give a talk about my own personal battles with anxiety and depression...little nervous...hope to do you all proud though 

i introduced myself to my class today without my voice shaking. i call that a real victory. 
it’s the worst week ever at university. syllabus week. the week where everyone has to introduce themselves. i had to do it twice and each time my voice didn’t shake when usually it does. this is such a big deal for me. cause i’m always embarrassed by how my voice shakes at first when introducing myself to others or talking in front of a large group. 
to anyone else who's having a self sabotage day
this goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. to everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have. i want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. i wish i knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. unfortunately, i can't, but i want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. you can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. you are worth it.  i had one of those self sabotage days today. my social anxiety has been crippling, i skipped the gym, smoked those cigs i planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. i know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why i'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this sunday. cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. edit: this post blew up more than i thought! i wish i could reply to all of you, but i'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). i feel so happy that what i've said has helped people. s/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. let's make today great!
anxiety

does anyone else feel like they're constantly doing something wrong but nobody's telling them what it is?
that's the best way i can put it. when people are nice to me i convince myself it's forced, someone has asked them to do it/they are obligated to do it, and that i'm constantly making mistakes but people aren't telling me to spare my feelings. it borders on paranoia and is very overwhelming, i just constantly fear having made some sort of mistake/making someone mad and that nobody is telling me about it. it's a daily occurrence for me to have this thought process.is that weird? am i alone in this?
i hate when you drink caffeine to get energized, but instead just get a panic attack and consequently wiped out...
this happened to me todayneeded the energy to get some work done. instead, got a panic attack mid lunch with coworkers...played it off really well, but i feel like trash now.oh well
does anyone else feel like their anxiety swallows up their whole personality?
sometimes i feel like i don't have a personality beyond the anxiety.i've been anxious my whole life.there are so many things that i can't do because of this fucking disorder.it makes me feel so fucking hopeless.
i am too sensitive for this world
does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? i am so worried about never being good enough that anytime i do something wrong or can’t figure something out, the tears start coming. i feel like i have absolutely no control over my emotions and it’s humiliating me. i started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. but when i start crying i get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. my dad told me i need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when i’m turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. i can’t seem to win. i can’t even check my email anymore because i’m so afraid to see someone saying i’ve done something wrong. i don’t feel as if i was made to fit into this world where i can’t even be told i’m not doing good enough without completely breaking down. what can i even do? i feel like i’ve lost all control of my life.
does anyone else get stomach pains and diarrhea with their anxiety?
my anxiety is partly linked to my extreme emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and for those of you who don't know about it, it ruins every aspect of my life, to the point where if i get the slightest stomach pain or uncomfortable feeling ill panic, which results in me having stomach pains all the time, and sometimes, maybe once a month or so i'll come across feeling awful, with crippling stomach pains and end up on the toilet for half an hour with poop coming out like a faucet, does anyone else experience diarrhea along with their anxiety? it really sucks
i was just elected to city council tonight.
hey all. i’m 26 years old (f) and decided to run for city council in the spring of this year. after making it through the primary, i worked on my campaigning all myself. made my flyer, bought the list of registered voters from the city, bought all postage, folded them, and mailed them all out.tonight is a win for all of us. it’s proof that we can get over these mental barriers from anxiety  if we let ourselves. it’s a hard fight, but tonight more than one battle was won.
does you anxiety ever make you feel like the people who love you the most actually think you're the worst person ever?
all week i've been overthinking every interaction i have with the people i'm close to and overanalyzing any comments they might make.  i've totally convinced myself that my fiancé actually hates me and thinks i'm incompetent garbage and it feels bad, man.
i graduated college today
i fucking did it. 5.5 years, 3 schools and 2 majors later i finally graduated with my bachelor’s degree and have a full time job lined up. my anxiety was so bad this last semester all i wanted to do was take a semester off and push everything back because i didn’t think i could get through it, but i did. and now i’m done. i’m just proud of myself and wanted to share. for anyone who thinks they can’t achieve their goals because of this debilitating illness, you can. don’t let it stop you. edit: thank you all so much for your kind words and support! i also majored in risk management & insurance for those asking. 
anxiety is having to leave for work at a certain time even though you know you’re still going to be 30 minutes early
i’m done with this 
being around people all day is just exhausting.

anyone else find they need near constant background noise to help stop anxious/depressed inner thoughts?
i realised i always have background noise, audiobooks, music, netflix, something on. i especially need this in times of quiet or before bed when my anxious and obsessive thoughts start to eat away at me. i can't seem to be alone with my inner thoughts, i'm not sure if it's healthy or not but the white noise seems to stem the flow and ease my mind
currently at the movies alone for the first time in my life. i’m kind of freaking out with my hands shaking but i’m also a bit proud i’m doing it - going to the movies alone has been something i’d always wanted to do but been too anxious and self-conscious to do
okay so it’s in a city 2.5 hours away from where i live so it’s a bit of cheating, as what’s put me off doing it before is seeing someone i know lol, and i am doing it to distract myself from not eating today...but i’m still doing it! i’m still super self-conscious about it but i’m not bailing..yet anyway.i’m pathetic i know lol, but there’s not many other places i can post about it, so here i am hahaedit: thanks for all the kind comments! i really enjoyed the movie and i’m glad i went! :)
hey
i just wanted to say happy new year to all the people in here who suffer from anxiety. i know it's such a hard thing to get over but we are the strong ones, anxiety can't take us away from our beautiful lives. just keep fighting with it, we'll see better days in 2020. i love you all!
things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too
i am taking lexapro and doing therapy, but i also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so i wanted to share my list. 1. i went completely caffeine free. it's been about a month. i also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. i didn't think i'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but i feel so much better off it. i drink a lot of decaf tea and water. the first week was rough (headaches!) but i powered through and stuck with it. 2. i stopped going on facebook altogether. the whole comparison crap and drama, don't need it.3. i don't watch the tv news. ever.4. i am not overweight, but i started exercising. my therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. i just do power walk videos on you tube, nothing fancy.5. i eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.6. my therapist told me to do more things that i enjoy. so with all the time i have since i'm not on facebook so much, i am reading books. light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. i also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes i get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, i know), so that's a process.7. i have the headspace app and do some mindfulness. this is really challenging for someone with anxiety i think. sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. but i have found the managing anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.8. my therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. so i try to focus on things i'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.9. i can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. this is the first time in my life (i'm 40) that i have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. if you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. i started with my employer's eap (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a real counselor because it was so helpful. look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. my instinct previously was to try to run away from it. i hated it and i was mad at it. but now i understand that it's part of who i am, i have to accept that and i have to learn how to manage it. hang in there, friends. you got this.edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ❤️
i’m finally leaving this sub, best of luck to all of you, wish i could hug every single one of you.
after years of battling anxiety and panic attacks, i am finally proud to say i live a life without excessive anxiety, panic and worry. i started lexapro and it’s changed my life. i feel as if a weight i didn’t know was there has been lifted off my shoulders. i can finally fucking breathe. people who are in these forums are people who need help, which there is nothing wrong with that. although, i don’t need help anymore! tons of people have helped me in this sub and given me great comforting advice. best of luck to all of you and i hope one day soon you too can leave this sub!!! pm if you need help or have any questions. much love.edit: you guys make it hard to leave. all of you are so supportive. anxiety is such a bitch and i seriously pray one day you all can live anxiety free!!! please pm for anything ❤️
i’m so proud of myself. i just started college. i’m a week in. i haven’t had friends to talk to in person in years. i made 4 wonderful friends and they made me so happy last night.
i didn’t wanna go to this school party/dance event last night.. i don’t know anyone here. even in high school and my hometown i never had any friends to talk to in person. for years i was alone and only had a few online friends.. i’m so glad i decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. i went to the event. after an hour of walking around and standing in the back, i decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. people were having fun and dancing around. and i ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. we started talking and i met the whole group of them. sorry for typing so much lol. i’m just so happy i finally have someone i can talk to in person. it’s amazing and i had a great night. i’m so so glad i decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. this is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. **update:** **she just asked if i wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, i agreed. but i’m instantly regretting this. what have i done.****update 2:** **it was fun. she’s really nice and caring. even got a hug. my first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. thank you all so so much for your kind words. you’re all amazing!****update 3:** **i’m beginning to worry i’m gonna make them hate me. i feel like i’m so annoying.. i’ve never really had friends in person, other than online friends, and ive been texting them a lot. they’ve been busy so we can’t talk in person. has this happened to anyone else? your mind and anxiety keeps telling you they’re gonna leave and forget you so you have to talk to them a lot and very often so you know they don’t hate you and you can have a little relief? what do i do?.. **update 4 (probably last update):** they we’re just busy. we hung out last night and watched a movie and had fun. already have plans for labor day weekend. i still can’t believe this is happening. this is the best hint that’s happened to me in 3 years. thank you all so so much for the kind words. you’re all amazing people. 
the mayor of my town posted this on facebook this morning...great message!

anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so i’m going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety
as the title says, i’ve got “a case of the spooks” where i feel woozy and dizzy and icky about just going to a car wash. as a kid i used to love going,  but now i find the chemically smell kind of difficult to manage. but the car is dirty and i want to do this. so now that anxiety has gotten involved, i want to be rude to it. so i’m gonna go get this car clean!edit: we got there and there was a line up of 5 cars ahead of us, so i had to double down on anticipatory anxiety too, but i won. and the car is very pretty now!
hey if you're reading this and your in a bad spot mentally or anything i hope you feel better soon and have a good day.

can i just say...

when someone tells me it's all in your head

anyone else get panic attacks when they’re family starts yelling/arguing?

i don’t know who needs to hear this but everything is going to be alright!

hi everyone! long ago i heard (or read) someone say something about anxiety that help me a lot and i'd hope it could work for you too: anxious people are some of the most courageous people on earth because they face their fear everyday

where i hang out when i'm freaking out. it helps! just need a weighted blanket now

i got on stage in front of 600 people to deliver a speech for a public speaking competition... and i won!!!
## some contexti was diagnosed with adhd in march, that same day i decided to conquer my fear and spoke on stage for the first time in a public speaking competition against 9 other people. i ended up winning! a few nights ago, i competed in the finals for title of *inspirational speaker of the year* and many other amazing prizes... and i won! ## proof[1st](https://imgur.com/rwlxuuz)go face your fears cause you'll never know where you'll end up.
update to: this past weekend, i overcame my anxiety and decided to shoot my shot: i asked out a guy i have a huge crush on and he said yes!! we're going out to get coffee soon 
unfortunately, getting coffee isn't going to happen as he is currently talking to another girl and said she wouldn't be too happy with him getting coffee with another girl \*sigh\* **** **** i'm glad he told me even though i'm disappointed and i very much respect him, so hopefully we can be friends or something (because i really really like him and think he's super cool) so yeah... that's a thing... 
are you ok? leave your user name and i'll check in on you at least once this month and ask you how are you going.
this is an idea i've been sitting on for about 3 months and now i'm willing to do it. i see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and i get it, i'm in that boat too. so i want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.if you leave your username i'll go through, when i'm bored, and send you a private message asking are you ok?you can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and i'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*ok that is all :) edit: wow it went from 6 to 56 in an hour, i thought 30 would be a good number but this is also good. thanks for all your kind words and to be honest i'm getting anxiety from just thinking about sending so many messages to random people but i promise i will get around to everyone by the end of the month. edit 2: as suggested by a couple of people you can absolutely take note of a few users and send them a pm if you'd like. me included. edit 3: oh crap, so long inbox, i barely got to know you. i'll just let this die down a bit before i start sending out more ru ok? pm's. but they will come, and when you least expect it, so don't wait on it. i'll be an ru ok? ninja. striking when you least expect it. 
does anyone ever feel so bad for saying no to someone that you end up saying yes, and then end up in a situation that you can’t get out of but should have never been part of...?

if you see this, you better have a good fucking day!
and always remember, fuck anxiety, it’s all energy! embrace it!edit: first silver ever!  thanks kind stranger. i suffer from anxiety all the time. as i’ve gotten older i try to focus on the anxiety as energy moving throughout my body.  if i have anxiety and i feel it in my stomach, i zone in on how my stomach is feeling, pay attention to the anxiety moving throughout my body and it helps to relieve it eventually, don’t ignore it as it’s there for your attention, something about your mental thinking or the physical world is causing this energy to enter your body, find out what it is, pay attention, don’t ignore it.
worth remembering if you're having a bad day.
1. your levels of norepinephrine, cortisol and adrenaline are off the charts. your fear is a neurophysiological illusion, not a fair representation of the way things actually are.2. your anxiety is feeding on your fear. why are you latching on to the thoughts you fear the most? what makes them feel more true than other, more neutral or pleasant thoughts? contemplate for a couple of minutes.3. is your breathing shallow? is your body feeling tense? relax the body and take some deep breaths for a couple of minutes. be mindful, and wait, with no fear. remind yourself of the fact in point 1. take note of the difference now.4. let out a deep bellylaugh at all this non-sense.
um hey
not sure this is important, but i went out eating alone for the first time! it went ok, i had trouble ordering, but other wise ok.
this is how you can stop cringing at that embarrassing thing you did 5 years ago!
so a friend told me this and i think it's really helpful.if you ever catch yourself rethinking something humiliating you did, stop and instead try to remember something embarrassing someone else did.you probably can't and that's probably the case for everyone else and nobody remembers what you did.
i drew how anxiety feels to me sometimes.

today is one of those days with anxiety. if you have it, you know.

after months of unemployment due to anxiety and depression, i’ve now landed myself a job
i’ve had anxiety and depression for quite a while, years; it usually creeps up on me but then goes away, it depends on my mindset and lifestyle. last year i lost my job (lost as in i had no choice but to leave due to my mental health) and went spiralling down, living off my savings which weren’t a lot at all.now, i can proudly say i turned up for an interview shaken and paranoid to be working there today and it feels great to be distracted. i can be on my own, i don’t have to talk to people all day and it’s laid back; perfect for myself.i am extremely proud of myself, although i still have a lot of issues with my mental health i need to address, small steps like this really help everything else.thanks for reading :)edit: 19 year old guy from the u.k, just for context :)edit #2: my first time receiving gold, thank you! i’m replying to all comments so i can show my love and support to each person, if you have anything you’d like to say or get off your mind, i’d love to hear it! 
hello this is an experiment.
i am afraid to post on social media. this is a test for myself to see exactly what kind of interactions i can have from doing this. i tried this before and deleted it after 20 minutes, so i just want to see how long i can keep this post up before deleting. have a great day edit: thanks so much for all of the support! all the comments and messages were very helpful :)
psa reddit drug dealers are trying to prey upon /r/anxiety and /r/depression users.
i just got a message from a user 'vanes0' trying to sell me some 'medication' from 'a guy'. clicking on their profile, they frequent /r/drugs and /r/blackmarket, including posting a picture of a pile of white powder on a scale.i won't go into the politics of drug taking - people have different views and it's their body and all that. but i do feel we should stay vigilant of those who are trying to take advantage of people who are in a potentially desperate point in their lives where they could make rash decisions. 
to anyone not having a good christmas due to family,
i'm your family now & i'll validate the crap out of you. merry christmas ❤edit: if any of you need a friend to talk to, my messages are always open.
it's okay that that cringy moment happened to you in highschool
it doesn't matter, we've all been there.
i just had a small conversation with two girls in my class and i didnt overthink it they were so nice and we laughed a little. and i even went to the board today to participate in my maths class and i volunteered for it!!! and i dont feel nervous i just feel excited and happy and accomplished yay.
it's so weird feeling this way because i was thinking of committing suicide two days ago
does anyone go over all the stupid and awkward shit you’ve done in your head over and over again?
it’s one of those days i guess. i’m beating myself over stuff that happened years ago for some reason today.
hadn’t left the house in four years update.
hello all, i wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago i had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  prior to this i did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.      after being house bound for 3 1/2  years i wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. i was so depressed and defeated i didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. i felt i had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision i reached out for help. i called my local  nami (national alliance on mental illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell i had been going through.  it felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. after a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested i start talking to a therapist via video chat. i did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. i was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. i then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company teladoc. i was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  my wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. the first two months were not good to say the least, i had a lot of side effects but i pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  i would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  i started to white knuckle drive around the block.  in may of this year at 5 months of medication, on a saturday morning something in me clicked.  i just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a home depot, went inside and made a purchase. it was terrifying!  i was a nervous wreck but by the time i made it home i was so stinkin proud of myself i was gitty. i came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement.      in the time since then i push myself everyday. little by little expanding my comfort zone.  i now can drive anywhere in the city, i have even taken the freeway to the next city over. i go for walks with my family to the park. i have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that i do have value, and i do have something to offer this world.  i still have down days but overall i am happy and proud of the progress i have made.       for me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    asking for help!   from the bottom of my heart i wish all of you the best.
have you guys been crippled by your anxiety so much that you just don't do your assignments?
hi,this is me. worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. its like a shitty negative feedback loop. as a result im actually failing this unit lol. every assignment has been handed late due to cripplying anxiety. i even got a fucking extension and i am way past that due date as well. god everything fucking sucks.
who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?
to give a brief backstory, i graduated college in spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at starbucks. about two months after graduation i started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. i was panicking that i didn’t already have a better job and that i was gonna lose my apartment because i couldn’t pay bills. after relentlessly searching until february 2018, i found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. since february, i’ve been doing great! i’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, i can comfortably afford my apartment!now, since about april, i’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like i’m not doing enough. i’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now i can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  but i’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that i actually dreamed of doing. i just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. every time i try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, i go right back into this comfortable routine. does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? if so...does it go on forever? will there ever be a time that i feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how i’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?
anxiety blob

for someone who is anxious about money, i sure do keep spending money as an outlet for anxiety

i bought myself tickets to a concert about two months ago just for myself. i forgot about it until this week, but i’ve been really excited about it! every single day, i’ve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. i’m not even worried i’m going by myself.
edit: friends, i made it! i got dressed up, made it to the venue, and i’m here! 
anxiety is just your brain coming up with fake news

anyone else have to basically be dead to call off of work and not feel guilty?
my stomach is an absolute mess, i can barely move without running to the toilet. but telling my boss i can't come in makes me crazy anxious, worrying they'll think i'm slacking or something. so then i put it off until i have to leave and just end up showing up and being miserable and unproductive all day. anyone have issues calling off?
i just found out about this subreddit and spent the last hour scrolling throught it. never felt so good in a long time, you guys bring me hope and it is freaking awesome, so many positive vibes and helpfull tips. this is one of the best remedy i ever had.....

does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?
pretty much every social interaction i have with someone, no matter how small, i spend a ridiculous amount of time afterwards playing back what i said over and over again in my head. even if what i said was totally normal, i still harp on it and pick it apart until i've convinced myself i've made a fool of myself.
i decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. it has been the easiest thing ever.
i am sure all of you have seen the posts across reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the fcc upcoming vote to dismantle it. personally, i feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. i don't want to get into the politics of it all, but i'm sure you can find that elsewhere on reddit.so this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when i get social anxiety. just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. so you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something i rarely do as it is because i worry about alienating people or making them upset. especially when it comes to politics.the main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... what do i say? my representative doesn't share the same political beliefs i do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? is there something special i need to do when they pick up? maybe i should just hang up...**first off**, i used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your zip code. plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. literally, i said this word for word: hello. i just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. so... um... yeah, i support 'title two' net neutrality rules and i would like you guys to publicly oppose the fcc's plan to repeal them. i would really like if you guys would contact the fcc chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. i don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the fcc from getting rid of the existing rules. so um... that's all. thanks.**secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. they were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. there wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.**and finally**, i didn't hang up! i stuck with it, and just read the script. when the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, you're doing great!), and it automatically calls the next representative.-----at the end of the day, i felt relieved that i did it. i was so anxious about it at first! but when i spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and i didn't feel scared because i realized their whole job is listening to people complain. the guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. the most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and zip code to confirm i lived in their district. that was it.long story short: even with my anxiety issues, i found it to be easier than i expected, and it made me feel like i accomplished something.p.s. my first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. i did this because i didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. so i just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but i found that sometimes their voicemail was full. so i need to try again the next day, because otherwise, i'm not being heard.**tl;dr:** i expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like i made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. it also means i actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.
anybody else enjoy the rain to calm them down?
i’m sure a lot of you do, but i’m just having a shitty monday and feeling extra depressed today for some reason. i saw it’s going to rain for the rest of the day once i get home from work, i got really excited and i can’t wait to sit at home to watch and listen to the rain to calm me down, it helps so much.i hope you guys are having a great monday.
does anyone else still stress out and feel embarrassed over things that happened 10-20 years ago?
i'm almost 30 years old and i still lay awake at night, feeling like a complete idiot of myself when i was 10-16 years old. then i realize how stupid it is to even care, but it doesn't really help.how do you get past this stuff?
i think the most disheartening thing about having anxiety is that it never goes away, you just learn how to cope better with it.
i cant see myself not having anxiety and really my heart just sinks. it’s just beyond cruel that this will be me for the rest of my life and the only thing that changes is how i manage it. there is no cure. i’m always going to be in my head one way or another. it’s exhausting.
does anyone feel like he's existing or surviving rather than living?

does anyone’s anxiety make them physically sick?
i feel sick to my stomach but nothing works to get rid of it. i also feel out of breath and shaky. i just want it to go away.
thank fuck for those new cashier-less ordering machines in mcdonalds, i ordered food by myself for the first time in over 4 years
bear in mind, you do still have to wait for your food and go take it from an employee, but it beats having to order it up front.
social media is toxic as fuck
i hate social media... it is a well known fact that it has a lot of negative effects on its users.   this year, i have deleted all my social media accounts, and people closest to me treat me like a fucking mentally ill freak questioning why i am off social media like people you know i am depressed, and this shit doesn't fucking help!!! and like wtf do you really want me to take a video of my breakfast everyday like fuck off and let me live my life with or without you genuinely in it you noisy fucks. &#x200b;people it's not healthy to invite everyone into your life, and post a fake summary of how your doing. the majority of users are not happy and they keep this egotistical game of look at me going in this circle jerk of likes. who the fuck cares!get over yourself and leave me alone.
anyone get anxious and paranoid when they're feeling great? ie 'oh fuck when is this going to end and why'
the universe is coming for me
how my agoraphobia makes me feel when i have to leave my house

i skipped work today due to my anxiety and now i'm so disappointed with myself. anyone else ever done the same thing?
my job makes me pretty depressed.my boss has been away for over a month and i was basically left to my own devices, which was great. he returned today.yesterday and last night, i was so worried that i would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. then i began worrying that i hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. i woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. now i'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that i wasn't at work yesterday. it's a vicious circle and i'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.anyone else ever done something similar?
hey, can i have a moment of your time?
thank you for reading this. i would just like to let you know that you are a wonderful, amazing person. you can do anything as long as you put your mind to it! if anyone of you reading ever need to talk, know that i am here for you. i believe in you! have a great day and don't forget to smile!edit: thank you so much for all the kindness! i never thought that this post would become this popular! and thank you friend for the gold! it is highly appreciated! love you all and have a good night for some of you, good day to the rest, and remember to keep a smile!edit 2: i have no words for how happy you all made me! these are my first ever awards! thank you all so much!
does anyone get the feeling that you're supposed to be worrying about something but you just can't figure out what it is?
like, right now i feel like there's something i should be worrying about and it's killing me, it's driving me nuts, and it's keeping me on edge because i don't know what it is and i honestly just want to flip every table i see.this happens like all the time and sometimes i hope my brain is just normal.&#x200b;edit: thank you all so much for the replies! it made me realize that i'm not alone and that there are other people who experience the same thing i'm experiencing right now and it made my day, thank you!i hope you all have a good day!&#x200b;(hopefully me editing this post won't make offend anyone and i'm sorry if someone happens to get offended by it. i just wanted to express my gratitude)
i slept with the lights off for the first time in 15+ years
i’ve had crippling nighttime anxiety around someone hiding in my apartment and watching me. it has severely impacted my sleep and i’ve had to sleep with all the lights on, locks on all of my doors, just every coping mechanism possible since i was 8 or 9. for the past 2 years i’ve been in therapy and doing small exposures to disprove this belief that i have. last night was the first time i could turn off all the lights in my bedroom and sleep in the dark. seems small but i’m proud
when your heart rate is up for no reason all morning and you’re just waiting for the anxiety/panic attack to strike 

dae get nervous to return to work or school after you've been away for a little while?
for me, it doesn't seem to matter how comfortable i am somewhere (though it is worse at newer/less familiar places), but if i get sick or something and skip a few days of class or work, i get really anxious to go back. particularly when i've been sick because i'm afraid i won't be totally better and i'll have to come home or it'll cause a lot of problems. right now, i'm returning to work after leaving sick last week and i'm really anxious about it.
i would trade anything in the world, anything, just to not have anxiety anymore. i just wish this struggle would end.

anyone else feel so self-aware of their anxiety, it almost feels like you’re faking it?
even in the middle of a mild panic attack, i can feel myself freaking out — i know my breathing is shallow, my heart is beating really fast, and my thoughts are scrambled and erratic. but because i’m aware of all of this, it almost makes me feel bad, like i’m putting on some kind of performance, or am just reacting this way for attention (even when i’m by myself!)maybe it doesn’t make a lot of sense when i type it out, but does anyone else feel this way?
does anyone else here always feel like they’re in some sort of trouble or someone is upset with them?
i think one of the worse symptoms of my anxiety is that i often feel in “trouble” or like someone is upset with me. usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. i end up questioning the things i did or said during the day and if i did everything correctly. often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. does anyone else get this? how do you combat the feelings?
with anxiety, you know what they say: whatever doesn't kill you makes you 99.99% believe that it will kill you, leaving you to live everyday life legitimately fearing that you will soon die.
haha i want off this ride, please.
small tattoo but big step

fuck anxiety

anxiety is just your brain coming up with fake news

i drew my anxiety

anyone gets stomach upset when anxious ?
i always get a very bad stomachache (diarrhea, constant farting and all kinds of smelly stuff) especially when i get anxious - and it’s always my left side of my stomach. ugh..it’s truly awful..anyone had the same experience or is currently going through it?*updated post*hello again everyone - thank you so much for sharing your experience! definitely did not expect to receive a lot of comments. my only big difference with you is that i’ve never been nauseous but just pumping out a lot of gases haha. anyway, thanks again for your comments. i’m glad i am not alone in this:)
i got my drivers license.. at 29
i finally did it.. it took me until early this year to start working on my license (first aid, theory, driving hours)  my 1st attempt i ended up having my exam hour on the one day when it was raining so hard i could barely see out of the car (i'd never driven in rain before)... i completely panicked and froze and, of course, didn't pass  i had my 2nd attempt yesterday, and even though i was shaking/sweating and (as the instructor later pointed out) made a couple of mistakes - i passed  about 11 years late compared to everyone else my age, but i finally have my license
the list i keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety
not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff i keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  i have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when i first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now i find myself rarely referring to it. hope it helps someone else!&#x200b;**note to self*** give it 20 minutes.* when you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.* the more i say “fuck it”, the better i feel.* it’s just your thoughts.* i don't know what's going to happen in the future but i know everything is going to be okay.* you got this. you know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.* what’s the worst that can happen if you fail? nothing.* look at the grand scheme of things. don’t focus so much in the moment. there will be a tomorrow.* you don’t have to do anything.* it’s not what i have to do. it’s what i want to do.* if you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. it escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.* don’t be afraid of your anxiety.* you are the play, and the world is your audience.* you shouldn’t be scared. treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.* why do you feel like you have to do anything? you don’t have to do anything.* the best thing to do is not think about it.* staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.(i know some things on this list repeat but i left them there for reinforcement)&#x200b;**4-7-8 breathing technique*** first, let your lips part. make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.* next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.* then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.* make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.* repeat.&#x200b;**aware calming technique*** accept the anxiety. don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.* watch the anxiety. tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.* act normal. breath normal and remain calm. don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.* repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. if the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. you’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.* expect the best. practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.&#x200b;**other*** as cliched as it sounds, i really recommend trying to live one day at a time. you're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.&#x200b;edit: wow! this post really blew up from when i posted it during an anxiety attack. i'm glad that so many people find it useful and hope you guys gain as much mileage from this list as i have. :d
we don't deserve this.
none of us do, what we deal with daily is a living hell, and we just don't deserve it at all. it's hard living like this, unbearably hard but let's not forget that we're so strong and resilient for fighting it daily. some people might wave us off and disregard how we feel with comments like just relax, it's not even that bad, you're just overreacting. but that's bullshit. i know how it is, we all do, and i want you all to know i'm proud of you, you woke up today and you faced anxiety head on, you did a thing, be it small or big you tackled today's tasks and you didn't crumble under anxiety. you're improving, you're doing better bit by bit, and i know how hard that is. so if no one else will tell you, i will, i'm proud of you and you're doing damn good. it might take a long time but i know each and every one of us can overcome this, it might take longer for some of us, but we'll do it. so just keep tackling it day by day, we're stronger than this, we never asked for this, we never once did anything to deserve this, but i know we'll beat it. stay strong, i love all of you.
has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?
ever since i was young, i've always been super anxious about everything. there's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where i'd avoid doing so much, even if i wanted to do whatever i was avoiding. i didn't even realise that it was a problem until i got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. from what i've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if i'm wrong), but as far back as i can remember i've always been that way. i'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.edit: reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than i was expecting. main reason i was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when i told him that i'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when i was older.
do you ever stay up late even when you’re exhausted to avoid facing the next day? venting
it’s been a stressful week. i just found out i owe more than i thought to the irs which means i can’t afford to leave my toxic living situation, i can’t afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won’t allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. i have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. sometimes i wish i could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. staying up late is as close as it gets. the rest of the world is asleep and i can think in peace. as soon as i go to sleep, i’ll wake up and it will be time to move through the motions again and scramble to pull myself together. yes, this is a rant but the question is not rhetorical. feel free to respond if you relate. this is my first post here (hi)edit: i didn’t expect this much support! thank you! update: i got one of my assignments done and finished the paperwork for my new job today and i’m feeling good about it! i’ve been brainstorming ways to make my current living situation more bearable, and am aiming to visit my dad over spring break in march. i’m doing my best to stay positive and not dwell on too many negative “what ifs” in regards to his condition. just trying to focus on one or 2 things at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed or spiraling out. i really do appreciate all of your kind words!
i love you
i hope you have a relaxing night <3
i went to a bookstore and got a coffee by myself today!
i have severe anxiety and it is really difficult for me to do things by myself; i like to have someone with me as it helps me feel less pressured. however, i decided to go to barnes and noble (bookstore) alone today, and they have a cafe in there. the first time i ended up leaving the bookstore without getting a coffee because i was too nervous, but i ended up going back twenty minutes later and got one!! it was so easy, and the barista was very friendly which helped so much. i’m so proud of myself, and i’m so happy. i started to feel a little overwhelmed and almost left again but i did it!! i hope you all are able to silence your anxiety like i did today, and if not, there’s always tomorrow 
today was my first good day in months. my anxiety and depression have stayed low, and i have a positive number in my bank. i feel like i've done some hard work just to have one good day, but it's encouraging.

my son isn't even two yet, but sat beside me through an anxiety attack.
so i was having an anxiety attack  in my kitchen. my son was watching tv in the next room and i could hear him. so i sat on the floor and started with the breathing. a few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. he comes over kisses me on the forehead. then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until i calm down. must have done something right with this kid.
i went to a concert by myself!!
no panic attack!! yay!!
does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?
even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. and if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.i remember there was a day where i was late to everything. i remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.for me, being on time means that i am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. when i am late, i feel like a mess.what can you do to make being late ok? i know it's not a big deal to those around me if i am a few mins late, but i feel horrible about myself. 
does anyone else get anxiety around people there own age but are fine with older people?
at work im pretty confident and anxiety free but when i'm walking through town my anxiety is high.has anyone found a solution as to what causes this?
update: oh my god you guys i got my first job!!
i was already proud enough of [getting through just the interview ](https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety/comments/bkn5eo/update_im_at_my_job_interview/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)but oh my god, i didn’t think i’d actually get the job!! i know i’m super late to this getting-your-first-job thing but hey, better late than never, right!? i’m just going to be bagging groceries but i’ll be making $3 an hour more than i ever thought i’d make and oh my god.. i have a job holy shit i have a week to mentally prepare myself for training. everyone so far has been so extremely kind, so i feel a lot better about the whole thing though i’m still shaking with nerves right now. the manager is extremely kind, the woman i just talked to on the phone was amazing, i met some of the people i’ll be working with and they were all so very nice. is it stupid i actually want to cry??? i’m so happy??
when i'm anxious, i procrastinate. after i procrastinate, i ruminate. since i'm ruminating, i'm anxious to even get anything done, that i should have long started, thinking, what's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ...
and i wonder why i am losing control over my life.update: a silver and these comments down below - whoa! i was sleeping on this post, much like how that initial novelty wears off from anything on reddit. but i did sign-up for gym in the meanwhile, after 8 odd years of reluctance. as u/basith_shinrah pointed out in a comment down below,“*you put it in words. i feel that's the first step in overcoming it*”.
here's to all of us at work who have snapped at colleagues, cried quietly at desks (or bathroom), had panic attacks and ruminated about it for hours on end!
we are doing the best we can. it's not easy, struggling and working at the same time. we are not failures. don't give up!
posting literally anything is so fucking stressful
i've had an account for 3+ yrs and have barely any karma bc i'm too anxious to post on any subreddit or even comment most of the time :(edit: omg i don't know why someone gave me gold for this dumb post but thank you so much for my first gold!!!
a man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears
after reading this quote many times it made me rethink my anxiety and take a new perspective. hopefully the insight will inspire you as well.
hey you. yes, you.
you’re going to be okay. take a deep breath. everything is going to be alright! 
tonight i finally asked the guy in the next apartment over to stop yelling to people over the computer to all hours of the night after about 3 months of trouble sleeping because of the noise.
i was shaking the whole time but i said what i meant to and this is a major win for me. of course i’m going to ruminate on the situation now and have trouble sleeping for that reason tonight but hopefully tomorrow night will be better. and yeah, the yelling was really that bad.
was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on saturday.
eight years ago today i had had enough and sat on the sea wall at midnight about to throw myself in. single, victim of dv, no full time job. i had terrible flashbacks, panic attacks, couldn't sleep. now i'm still anxious but medication has helped enormously. i have a permanent full time job i love, a partner i love and i got to see my boys become fine young men. see your doctor. you can get through this x
getting out of bed is really hard for me. is anyone else's anxiety worst in the morning?
my anxiety hits me the second i wake up. i feel awful and i have zero energy. i literally just want to lie in bed for the rest of the day. waking up is hard for me in general. i have low blood pressure and i feel really groggy and dizzy when i wake up, so that makes getting out of bed even harder.once i do get up, eat,  have some water etc, i usually do feel better. but the problem is, mornings are hell for me, and some mornings my anxiety wins and i stay in bed till well past noon. anyone have similar experiences, any tips? 
if you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...
 a moment to breathe. take a minute and:- stretch your back- get your shoulders back- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/saltedbiscuittv)- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you- close your eyes (really, just do it)- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (i suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place i am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds- exhale as slow as possible...- repeat 5 or 10 times- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are not alone, think about it and feel that connectionlater:- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... - if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! when you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and do it. it’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. i have mine with a list of good things in life/things i enjoy doing/reminders that i’ve struggled for years and... i’m still here!have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are never alone <3edit #1: added one more step thanks to u/saltedbiscuittvedit #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on imagining you're elsewhere might be harmful to some peopleedit #3: as i am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress i just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! it feels amazing that venting while i was having a hard time helped someone out - thank you! :') edit #4: close your eyes after you read all of it ;)
a cute comic today. it came with the tagline: 'oh, don’t cry – proven to stop all crying, 100% of the time'

you can do way more than you think, don't let your insecurities define you. listen to the wisdom inside you and cherish it. you have something good to bring into this world, let it be heard. have a nice day ;)
edit: thank you for all the positive feedback, it puts a smile on my face to know that you can believe in this post and that you're all filled with hope ;)it's ofcourse often not easy to believe in yourself, a quick fix doesn't exist and maybe this post is very vague for you. i elaborated on this topic in the comments. hope it can help you!
painted how disassociation feels to me

does everyone else's anxiety feel more intense at night?
i swear that from the moment i wake up until dusk i feel good (to the point i don't feel anxious anymore) but when it's dark outside, even when i'm home with my family, my anxiety becomes more intense.
summers when you have anxiety

have you ever felt anxious because everything in your life is going on perfectly, but you are worried about something wrong that might be happening without you realize it?
it's a period in my life when everything is fine. i didn't quarrel with my boyfriend in years, i am passing all my exams, my parents are strangely nice and comprehensive with me, i didn't even catch a cold and i am surrounded by lovely people... i am used to living an unpleasant life, bearing problems all the day and feeling nervous at night and deeply unhappy. however, now i could live the perfect life, but i keep asking myself why is everything fine, what's going to happen, if i have any disease, what terrifying destiny is going to punch me in the face. because of this, my hypochondria is getting worse, i sometimes am convinced that it's not possible for me not to have problems in life, so i must have some deadly disease and every signal my body give to me makes me want to run to the doctor... sometimes i can't sleep at night because i fear that my house will burn while i sleep, or that some thief will break into my home to steal something (even though we don't own anything valuable!) and doing bad to my family... have you ever felt that way or am i just an idiot to feel even more anxious because i literally have nothing to worry about?
today i joked at the office
and everyone laughed so hard. it felt so overwhelming that i had to go outside for air or else they could've seen me cry.
i ordered two subway sandwiches successfully!
i know it’s not that big of a deal for others, but i was able to order two subway sandwiches without getting anxious and speaking quietly or stuttering. i’m actually really proud of myself.&#x200b;edit: i usually don’t edit posts but all the support in the replies is really uplifting. thank you all for that :)
anyone else get anxiety about having anxiety
and because of your anxiety, caused by having anxiety, you get more anxiety.
the thing about an anxiety disorder is that
you know it's stupid. you know with all your heart that it wasn't a big deal and that it should roll off of you.&#x200b;but that is where the disorder kicks in. suddenly the small things is very big and it keeps growing in your head, and trying to escape from under skin.you know with all of your heart that you're being ridiculous and you hate every minute of it.
who else is in their mid-late 20's and has hardly experienced life and never go out?
it's really bothering me that i let my mental health own me so much. i am 26 and don't do anything fun. it's no wonder i am depressed. i never go to bars or clubs or have a group of friends to hangout with. i don't have any hobbies that'd help me meet people. i am doing nothing right towards socializing. i work and hang at home with my family. that's all i do. who else is missing out on life and meeting people?
i was having a particularly rough morning dealing with my anxiety yesterday morning. i decided to call in sick, but the idea of having to call in sick made me anxious and as a result, ended up going to work...
was a rough day at work with only a couple of hours sleephow good is anxiety
this made me smile, maybe it'll make you smile, too.

who else gets stomach issues and thinks it's related to being anxious often?
name the symptoms. i currently feel unwell after being woken up from anxiety then i had a bmim sipping ginger tea and took pepto and i got a heating pad.i have a huge fear of vomiting btw so i'm worried it'll get worse. 
i booked my first therapy appointment!
after about 10years of thinking about it. i finally swallowed my pride, was honest with myself and booked my first appointment. i'm too embarrassed to tell anyone i know, but it was a great relief and it feels great. just needed to tell someone.
anyone else get paranoid that everyone hates them?
i have social anxiety and sometimes i get an overwhelming feeling that everyone around me hates me. i walk through work and i feel like everyone is staring and i did something wrong but i don't know what. i start to panic and i just want to quit and go hide. anybody else ever feel this way?edit: thank you to everyone who commented. it’s nice to feel like you’re not alone in this world. i’ve often heard a dismissive “that’s irrational. stop it”  when discussing this feeling and it’s so refreshing to see others relating and giving great advice. thanks again everyone :) have a great day!
i drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday
first of all, excuse my english.this happened almost 8 years ago, i was 8 and she was about 4.it was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, i was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.she started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so i went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready i put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. i left her alone there and i went to the first floor to watch tv.when adults came back they asked for my sister, i told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, i followed them, i didn't understand the situation.when we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.so, basically i killed her.the relation with my family has never been the same. i am still in therapy for it, i have tried to kill myself time ago. in addition i was adopted so i spent months thinking that my family was going to give me back.my mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, i know that she is still disgusted of me.i will never stop feeling guilty, i am really sorry. there is nothing i can do to feel better.
after fighting years of having a crippling fear of heights i climbed mt. fuji today! [image]

does anyone else find it a little surreal that people just go about their lives?
i don't know if i'm alone with this thought, but the idea that my friends can just go out is mad. like people just get up and do. daily stuff like catching a bus, going to the supermarket, going to lessons, all things i'd have to do with at least some level of panic involved. and people just get on with it.back when i was still able to go out, there were hours before hand of making sure i've eaten properly, washed thuroughly, at least 30 minute lie-down to calm. and then there's my housemate who just hops out at a moments notice.it just seems... strange  p.s. i was not expecting this many people to see this, i can't really imagine 900 indeviduals. there was 600 at my secondary school, that's mad. thank you everyone for sharing your stories and perspectives. it's been a really plesant to read them all <3
calmed myself down from a severe panic attack. i'm proud of myself.
i was able to use self talk to help me calm down. i was vomitting, dry heaving, and shaking. it lasted a good couple of hours but i finally got to breathe. apps like calm and forest help!edit: big thanks to everyone!
fuck anxiety fuck panic attacks fuck not living fuck feeling like a pussy fuck having life on pause fuck feeling scared fuck feeling uncomfortable fuck not seeing daylight fuck not leaving the house fuck having no friends fuck being a fuck up
feed me scripts till the day i die. i'm not doing this this anymore. fuck being sober.edit: mods if you need to remove this because of the swearing that's fine. i just don't know how else to vent right now.edit 2: thank you all for the support and i want to stress that this was not posted for karma. i could give less of a fuck about numbers. but thank you all. feel free to dm me if theres nobody else around when you're in need.
i’m 22, living at home, haven’t had a job in months and am now just applying for a construction company. wish me luck i’m sick of feeling like a failure.

anyone else lost the energy to deal with people, like any people, even friends?
my anxiety takes so much energy from me, i avoid people as much as i can, even my friends, even family. the moment they start talking it feels like sensory overload immediatly. i have to force myself out of the house so much. i am working from home, which makes it even worse. i do feel lonely sometimes but then imaging someone being around is such an unbearable thought. it is not social anxiety, i am not scared of people or what they think of me, i just think they're unbearable and i lack the energy to deal with their bullshit. i used to be super extrovert some years ago, it all changed when i developed anxiety. i'm in therapy already, but it doesn't help, like at all. i don't wanna live and die like a hermit, but i don't know how to help it.
does anyone else cry when someone is unhappy with you or after being scolded?
i just got a stern talking to from my boss about a mistake i made and i managed to keep it together while talking with him but as soon as i got off of the phone i started crying and wanted to hurt myself. ive been crying off and on for the last 40 minutes and i need to get over it and move on. i wish i was more resilient. people make mistakes and not everyone is going to be happy with you all of the time, i need to learn how to bounce back and go back to getting work done not sit here and cry uncontrollably for almost an hour. does anyone else struggle with this sort of thing? how do you deal with it? 
what it's like to have high functioning anxiety

i hope something nice happens to you today.

fuck anxiety. i am legend.
i had an explosive panic attack yesterday that shot up my heart rate and blood pressure. i almost passed out. but guess what. i slept for 12 hours, and got right back into the thick of life! i refuse to crumble every time anxiety gets to me. i am a functional anxious motherfucker. but i'm also a warrior and will not back down! stay hard!
anyone else really enjoy eating lunch alone?
i'm pretty introverted and have a low tolerance for social situations (i get mental exhausted/bored quickly).lunch is my time to recover.
overcoming self-defeating behaviors is not easy; it’s a journey that may take years. remember that you did not develop this self-defeating behavior overnight. which probably means that you will not be rid of them overnight either, so the key to success is patience, resilience, and passion

it feels like i become “myself” when i’ve had alcohol
when i’ve had alcohol, even maybe just 1/2 drinks, i feel relaxed, i can hold easy conversation without overly deliberating over what i’m going to say, i can crack jokes that i’d be otherwise too scared to make, i can hold eye contact, i can speak freely, and i’m just generally more open and likeable. i’ve tried time and time again to accomplish this while sober but it’s never happened for me i’m not an alcoholic, and i drink less than once every fortnight, but whenever i *do* drink, i find myself wishing i could be my tipsy self all the timeedit: for example, i’ve had a glass of wine which led to me making this post when usually i’d be too anxious to post on this sub?? i lost the lottery of life i swear
today i won.
today i got up, showered and actually washed /brushed my hair. i noticed that it was a beautiful day after literal weeks of rain so i took a bunch of blankets and pillows out on the deck with books and snacks .. i ate real food for the first time in 10 days (penne bolognese ).. last night i finally slept after days of being awake even if it was only for a few hours then again today i had a small nap. i ran my life today and it felt great. i hope this feeling stays... although i could use some more sleep which i hope comes easily tonight.
i'm anxious about being able to get a job so i avoid applying to jobs so i don't feel anxious about it so i feel more anxious about not having a job!
i just need to get over it!! i can get a job! i can apply! i can interview and do the job!! why is it so hard to make myself do the applications holy shit!!!
today i broke out of my anxiety and went to the cinema alone
i saw glass and it was amazing
does anyone else get anxiety from being seen by someone they know?
if i’m at work, or at a store, or just driving my anxiety runs wild if i see someone i know. i’m not sure why i am so scared of being seen by people i know but i literally cannot just drive around with my windows down or anything like that. it’s giving me anxiety just thinking about it. i work a nice job and drive a nice car so i’m not embarrassed about it. anyone else have this problem?
after not leaving the house in 4 years..
i can’t stop smiling right now! in june it will be 4 years since i left my house and today i went to the home depot and made a purchase!!!! walking to the car to leave felt like i was walking into a war zone! it’s not far from my house but there is a couple traffic lights that scare the shit out of me, not to mention it’s the freakin home depot on a saturday morning.  it was not easy and i thought i was gonna loose it a few times (and almost did) but i somehow kept it together. i am just so proud of myself right now and needed somewhere to say it!  there is hope out there.edit:  wow, silver and gold!, thank you all so much, i can’t tell you how happy i am from all the support. i am literally having the best day!!!!!  brief history of how i got to this state in comments...
today i ate in a restaurant by myself
i’ve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and i’ve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when i’m in company i’m comfortable with, i’ll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because i think i’m going to choke on every mouthful. i’ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. today though i thought “fuck it” i’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so i popped into a small thai restaurant near my home for lunch. i sat at my table and i ordered some food and i ate. it was overwhelmingly liberating, i could have cried. it wasn’t easy to eat but i finished my plate and i’ve never been more proud of myself.
guys i made it to the gym today!!
after having signed up (online) in october!edit to add: i've now gone three days in a row! i even used two machines!!!!
have you ever postponed crying and then couldn't cry later?
so i had a crappy day, was condemned in public and i controlled myself from crying. it was a success! but i still felt like crying and the feeling of sadness/anger/misunderstood was(and still) stuck inside me. i waited until i could get back home to cry. however, when i get back i'm too tired to cry? does that make sense 
i got a job!
the past 6 months my agoraphobia had gotten so bad that i avoided leaving my house completely. a few days ago i decided to start applying for jobs. i had an interview today and after having 2 panic attacks about it and fighting my fears for hours, i went. the interview went so well that they wanted me to fill a different position that would be way more interesting, pay more, and i’d have my own office. i was hired on the spot. needed to share this with somewhere. don’t have a lot of friends lol:)update: thank you for the silver❤️ i had my first day today and it was awesome. my manager is great.
i went to the bakery alone!!!
i'm 17 and basically can't do anything by myself. if there's no one with me when i go outside, i completely freeze up. but this morning my mom was sick so she slept a little longer. i went to the bakery all by myself and even managed to order a coffee to go :)this is such a silly thing to be proud of, i know. but it's a big step for me. anxiety has ruined so much, but things like this make me realize that i've improved - no matter how little.edit: thank you so much for all the nice comments! and i thought my day couldn't get any better :d i hope that every single one of you keeps celebrating your small but important victories!
happy fourth of july to all of the anxiety sufferers out there who are stuck at home or having to make excuses to others as to why they can’t be somewhere. the isolation is real.

does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you’re probably just being paranoid?
just me? i feel like all of my friends actually don’t like me and “put up with me,” or that every good relationship i’ve ever had i’ve ruined—even though when i’m being rational i don’t see anything terribly wrong that i’ve done. i just feel so much anxiety around them, as if my every move could ruin another friendship. or i get so anxious that i disappear from the friendship entirely and that’s why they don’t like me anymore, because i abandoned them. it eats up at me. i’m so afraid to hang out with my friends because i’m afraid they will think badly of me, but then our friendship drifts apart.
i’m very grateful for my cat
it’s 2:00am and i just woke up in a panic. this happens at least 3 times a week. my heart is racing and i’m breathing fast and i can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. initially i don’t know why- probably a nightmare but i can’t remember what i was dreaming about. then i start thinking about everything i have to do today and all the time i wasted yesterday laying around the house when i should have been getting things done. my heart is still pounding in my chest and i feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. she usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until i fall asleep again.i don’t know what i would do without her. she does this when i’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.this will probably get buried but i just wanted to share. 
finally decided to woman up and visit a psychiatrist today and got told that i had severe anxiety and panic disorder and should've visited sooner. hopefully will get my life back on track. my mind has exhausted me.
my brother said i deserved it for acting up idk what that even means but it hurt. you gotta take care of yourself cause even your family doesn't always care.
does anyone’s anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?
i have a lot of physical manifestations from anxiety like chest tightness, nausea, headaches etc., but i find i often get irritable if i’m in a social setting for too long. i’ll snap at the people around me, i get disoriented and withdraw. as well, i notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. maybe this isn’t so much anxiety, but i notice it nonetheless. for example, i had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and i couldn’t just accept that i had done well. i kept thinking things like “oh maybe everyone did well” or “maybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.” i also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. i’ll catch myself saying things like “why is your heart beating so fast, my god you’re just getting on the bus, it’s not a big deal.” anyone else? i’m curious!edit: thank you for all the upvotes and comments everyone!!! i really thought the irritability and negativity was uncommon with anxiety, it’s so comforting to know it’s not. thanks for sharing your experiences with me, it helps me more than anyone will know.
hey you! 
you made it through today. you can't change yesterday and you can't predict tomorrow. when you worry, you're only putting yourself through something that isn't necessary because we can't predict outcomes. only look forward with positivity and accept what comes, then work from there. for all you know, whatever is worrying you will turn out great. you did it. you got through today. breathe. breathe that sigh of relief, and relax your shoulders for a minute. you are lovely, strong, worthy and blessed. if you've been asking for a sign, this is it. ✨if anyone needs an uplift but doesn't want to read all this (that's okay!), just know my doggie wants you all to be happy. http://imgur.com/a/yhdcwho
guys—for the first time in my life i stopped a panic attack before it started.
i felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference i attended. it always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. usually, the second i feel that dizziness hit i know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. i hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in days of constant vertigo afterwards.i felt it coming on as i was headed to the talk, but it was a talk i was really interested in so i was like “oh no you don’t!” i focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and guess what. for the first time ever, without medication, i got the panic attack under control. and i was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!i’m so proud of myself, you guys. i had to share because i want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there are mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. we can do this! we don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! and that’s the best feeling in the entire world.
words cannot describe how proud of myself i am right now.
hands shaking, heart pounding, i told the guy at tsa that i had never flown alone and he reassured me that they were always there to help. hands still shaking and heart still pounding, i went through tsa keeping a close eye on my valuables. a little less shakily, i found my gate.  waiting to board. i have never been more proud of myself than i am right now. 
anyone just feel cloudy minded from anxiety? like you can’t think straight but you can still function?
like does anyone else get the feeling that their head is inflated and pressury and you feel like you can’t think but you can still function just fine? just wondering if this is just a me thing or not.
happy world mental health day everyone!
i hope you all have an anxiety free day
sorry... i couldn't help myself. i haven't felt this happy since i was a kid.

i haven't self harmed in one whole year.
the last time i self harmed was about a year ago. (i know, even more depressing because it was near christmas!)i have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. i didn't ever think i would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. it's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. it was all very sudden as well. i started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and i was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head. i never got treatment. my mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and i swear to god...she was useless. i appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. i'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. i was scared that i wasn't 'ill enough' or i would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. thinking about it now i understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state i was in?my dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. it's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. a few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. they wanted to know how to help and even i didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. how can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? i had completely lost touch with the real world.three years later, it's still extremely difficult but i persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. i used to rage when ever anyone told me that but it's true.to be honest, i don't think i will ever overcome my mental health, but i've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. i've grown as a person, i've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and i'm actually going to have a clean, joyful christmas. this present time in my life is currently the happiest i've been since. the best part is that i'm thankful. of course there are days when i think i wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. i am thankful! so...thank you anxiety! thank you!remember to love your brain and your body. you only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. there is so much more to life than pain and suffering.and most importantly... congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. it might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! i believe in you all.learn to love your brain <3merry christmas guys x
three years ago i was too afraid to leave my house or look out windows, i hid my anxiety with daily binge drinking and dropped out of college. yesterday my partner had to leave unexpectedly during a vacation for a work emergency, and i travelled the south coast of iceland all by myself!
hello all—i wanted to share some details from my journey with mental illness and progress.i am 22f. i have had troubles with substance abuse, anxiety, depression, behavior comparable to cluster b personality disorders, and severe depersonalization-derealization symptoms for quite some time. i’m a massive hypochondriac and have a horrible fear of flying and being alone.a few years ago, when i was at my worst, i was using drugs and dropped out of community college twice because i was too afraid to leave my house. i lived with a guy who was really bad for me and who i was very terrible to, and gained 20 pounds in a year. i remember being so severely anxious and depressed that i had to start doing therapy over the phone because i didn’t want to go out to see my therapist, and if i went outside (something i only did to smoke cigarettes) i couldn’t look out at the trees or up at the sky because everything was so overwhelming. i thought i’d never get better, i thought things would only get worse tbh.fast forward over the next year, the boyfriend ends up moving out and we have a very dramatic breakup. i begin to have to force myself to drive to run errands, and i grow so lonely that i decide to start seeing friends again—they were so welcoming. over the next few months, i started to pick up the pieces. i moved closer to a city to go to massage school, i got a job, i started dating, got on a plane for my birthday, supported my family through my grandfather’s palliative care. then i finished massage school, which was a huge triumph for me. i moved to dc, and got my dream job. i met an amazing man and started a new, better relationship. i stopped using drugs, i switched to a significantly better therapist. tried psychiatrists as well, but ended up not going that route. my boyfriend became my husband when he needed to move to the middle east for a job and i decided i’d go with him for some time to enroll in esthetician school there. we moved to qatar, i picked up exercising and meal prep and ended up at my lowest weight as an adult. i’ve been writing and reading more. i’m back in school, adding modalities to my work. still seeing my therapist via teletherapy. since i moved in august i’ve managed to get on 11 planes and will fly again tonight, though it is still very scary for me i know i can do it. i’ve travelled 7 new countries that i’d never thought i’d see, and truly enjoyed it. that said, i still have my struggles. i believe i always will; however, the difference in the quality of my life is remarkable. i still have panic attacks sometimes, i still go through extremely obsessive-compulsive behavior and hypochondriasis, i still have dpdr episodes, and i still struggle with impulsive behavior and the relationships in my life—but everything is not so severe as it was. yesterday was a new milestone for me and i’m super stoked about it. my husband and i, on vacation in iceland, received news that he had to leave immediately for work. we’d already paid for two flights and accommodations for another day in iceland, then 2 days in london, so we decided it’d be best if i took the trip myself. i was terrified. i’ve never travelled alone internationally, and the last time i flew alone was 4 years ago—which was my worst panic attack on a plane. but i decided to try anyways, and i’ve surprised myself so far. yesterday i woke up alone, drove [5 hours away from my hotel to sightsee](https://imgur.com/gallery/4ywry43), even through some scary weather, and even did a 2 mile hike alone. i loved it! i can’t believe what a great time i had! i am sitting in a cafe now writing this to you all because i feel so grateful for the departure i’ve taken from the life i used to live, and how much less my life is dominated by the limitations of my mental illness. also—i haven’t had a cigarette in a week! tonight i will fly alone for the first time in a long time, and i’m terrified, but i know i can do it. whatever is going to help you live the best version of your life, you can do too. thanks everyone! i’m around for a bit doing some reading and planning if anyone has questions about my symptoms and experiences or wants to discuss.
feeling lonely when no one is around you is bad enough. feeling lonely even when people are around you is torture.

some people just constantly know what to say in a conversation and can feel completely at ease when speaking to a total stranger and it really bugs me that i can’t do that

dae get messages from others that you are too anxious to read and then get anxious all over again the longer you don't reply?
basically the title. i get so anxious opening work related (and in general too) messages/dm's because of the need to reply since the sender can see that you've read said message to the point of rarely opening them now. well i feel great for a day and then my anxiety increases more and more the longer i wait to read the message. i'm to the point that i want to let someone else open all of my messages and relay the info to me, but some of the message chains have so many unread messages that i'm now afraid of just seeing/hearing bad news related to not opening the prior message that'll make me even more anxious. i'm in this inbetween area it feels like where i keep telling myself that tomorrow i'll open all of them so it subdues my anxiety a bit and this keeps going on daily. i literally have no valid excuse to tell these people either so i feel like i'm just intentionally screwing myself over and probably causing problems (that i haven't even read about yet in the unread messages).i dug myself this hole and hate feeling anxious all the time from it, but also hate how i feel slightly less anxious just ignoring it.edit: thanks everyone just for even replying, it strangely feels good to know that i'm not alone at all in feeling this way. tomorrow i'm biting the bullet and going to go through all accounts (or what i can in the time i'll have) i can think of to reply to or delete messages and emails. typed out a few replies for different situations that i'd been avoiding so i have no feasible excuse now! i'm bound to have a couple angry replies but i figure the quicker i reply the quicker i can sum up our conversation and never talk to them again! thinking about it in that sense makes me just every so slightly excited to get rid of all the message baggage.
first anxiety attack in front of boyfriend
my boyfriend and i have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. yesterday was the first time i had an anxiety attack in front of him. he has known that i have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.well yesterday, i was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. i went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then i broke down, i realized that i had been in the bathroom for too long so i quickly washed my face and went back out. even though i had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. at first he didn't see it because i was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went are you okay?that's when i pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said i'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attackhe asked why, and when he realized i couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. throughout the rest of the attack, if i told him not to touch me he'd lay off. if i told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. he even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said mom's sad. give her love to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.i just... aghast. i'm so happy he reacted the way he did. but in my head i thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. i'm so happy he took it the way he did and i'm surprised as well. but goddamn i love that man.&#x200b;tl;dr i had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and i thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if i needed it and backed off if i needed it and i really appreciated it
does anybody else often click the discard post button because they're worried about people being judgemental?

anxiety is like an app is sending you constant push notifications and you can't disable them.

anyone else get anxiety over just making a reddit post?
it seems when i want to post something, i'm excited about it because it's a subject of interest and i want to discuss it. but then when i post it and get replies..there's always at least one person who is really rude and implies that whatever im talking about is dumb. then i get anxiety. i get defensive at times too. sometimes i get close to deleting the post because i don't like people disrespecting me when i know damn well i don't deserve it
does anyone here also worry they are cringey/annoying all the time?
i feel insecure and worry that im not funny just cringey. people have told me im cringey online but i just eant to know how to not be cringey. any advice?i also have a lot of self hate and self doubt. youll never be good enough.i just feel so embarassed and ashamed of myself.of course im sure everyone does something cringey once in a while... im just worrying way to much. thanks for readingedit: thank you all for your wonderful advice. happy holidays and have a great day!
who has social anxiety or panic disorder but seems completely normal on the outside?
i have a bit of social anxiety at certain times and my panic disorder comes on every so often as well. but from the outside i seem completely normal even like mid panic attack. i’m just curious to know how many other people i interact with on a daily basis that are working and living and doing things but still struggling immensely with anxiety ?
hey you
yes. you. the person reading this right now. you're amazing. i'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're still here. i don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but i'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. you're incredible. keep fighting. keep going. it's going to be okay. i know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. you're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. those moments are going to see you through the storms. because there will be storms. maybe you're in the storm right now. you'll get through it. because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. you're incredible and strong, and i know you can do it. i have faith in you. i'm here for you. you. are. amazing.
i can’t even remember how it felt like not suffering from anxiety fuelled depression, i’m 35 and having the worst time of my life. today, i forced myself to go to the gym despite my inner voice saying i can’t. feeling great about it.
thanks to you all, kind internet strangers! my heart feels so warm thanks to your sincere comments; everyone who shared their own stories and everyone who told their experiences, thank you! we are not alone. p.s. my very first award, thanks.
i brushed my teeth!
hi, everyone.i don't tend to post here but i really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. i have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. i went to the dentist in may due to an emergency. the dentist explained to me that i have beautiful teeth that just need some tlc after not brushing them for years. i remembered that about a year ago in aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. she urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.with all this information in mind, i've been saving up money to go out and buy a sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. today, i finally did it. i bought everything i needed. i brushed my teeth for the first time in months. i have no more plaque buildup. i set an alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so i remember to brush my teeth. i'm crying because i finally did it. my teeth might just be saved.
does anyone else have that dilemma of wanting to see a therapist for your anxiety, but your anxiety keeps you from making an appointment? 

i just ordered food by myself!
i didn’t even know what kind of pretzel i was getting i just pointed at the first thing i saw and said “give me one of those” lol. i’m giddy right now and so proud myself! just felt like sharing this with someone
when the day is over, let it go. don't dwell on what you could've or should've done. tomorrow is another day and another chance. if it's meant to be, it will come again.
no worry can change the past, it serves you no purpose to dwell on things that cant be changed.  tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to change how you see and live your life.  how you chose to view the affects of your past rest purely with you and your perspective on life.  try find the positives in what comes your way in order to break any negative trends you may have created.when you find harmony and good in things around you, you'll find yourself.  we have to break the cycle off negativity in our lives in order to be open to the good around us.positivity breeds positivity.i wish everyone happiness in all that you do.
the constant fear that all my friends hate me and think i’m annoying and want me to stop talking but are too nice to say anything is crushing

an accurate portrayal of when you're casually hanging out with friends and, simply out of the blue, anxiety hits.

anxiety robbed me of my personality
and the more i think of this, the more depressed i feel that anxiety has become such a huge part of my life that i forget who i am without it. the person i was without anxiety seems so different and distant. i miss her. i miss her so much.

do any of you ever have really bad anxiety episodes that make you wonder how the fuck am i going to make it through the rest of my life like this?

what having a mental illness feels like. :(

do you ever feel calm and become anxious because you don't understand why you're so calm?

does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?
i've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like i'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. i'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few productive things i wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning html/css or working out). however, when i get back from work i find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. and my heart starts racing more as i become aware of how much time i just wasted. at that point, i feel so panicked that i can't do anything productive or relaxing.i think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. i place too much importance on developing new skills so then i'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. for example, i bought a course to learn unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program
foodies who no longer have the energy - i'm writing a cookbook to help people who no longer have the motivation to cook through depression or other issues and instead resort mainly to things like fast food, may i ask what you like to see in it?
hi everyone!please excuse me, i know this is a strange thing to talk about but i was recommended to pop it in here. please remove it if it isn't allowed (and please excuse my gosh awful english!) !for those who don't know me (which i'd imagine is everyone) i'm an ex-cook whose been dealing with depression on and off since i was 14.thanks to two very close friends i've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and i wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.whilst it's a long way in development, i plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !in the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things i will be adding, but i would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! it can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) vegan - vegetarian - meat feast or mixed!i would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. i have received some good feedback from those i pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, i'm still working on that!) i would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle ![https://thedepressedcooksbook.weebly.com/](https://thedepressedcooksbook.weebly.com/)edit: oh my goodness guys! i was expecting this to tank but instead it's taken off ! i want to say thank you so very much for the support, i will do my very best to implement everything you guys have suggested and make it as good as possible!
does anyone else sometimes feel physically sick from anxiety?
about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn’t breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn’t worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it’s over now and i’m with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven’t been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that’s coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks.
world suicide prevention day | september 10th! ❤️ “... you matter! ❤️ speak out, ... tell someone now, before it’s too late! ❤️”
this is my first time posting. ... i know this is a subreddit related only to anxiety, but i just wanted to say, ... “... you have someone right here, who cares for you, and is open to talk to anyone, about anything, concerns, etc., whatever, ... i can understand, empathize and feel sympathy, and am also very supportive and friendly, so come to me please, if you ever need to talk!” ❤️ “i’m hear for you, ... any of you, and always will be!” ❤️
a cool anxiety technique i learned
**step 1** - think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. if you are actively anxious you can use that as well. **step 2** -close your eyes and classify that anxiety. give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. picture it and tell yourself this is my anxiety. **step 3** - now change that shape in your mind. warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. it's not an end all be all technique but i have found it helpful. this might be kind of weird for some but i've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. while doing that, also physically smile yourself. smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. **edit:** since this got bigger i thought i'd provide an example for some people having trouble. for me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. what i did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. i think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. it helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!

does anyone else hate how easily other people can ruin your day?
 a phone call with an angry client, a threatening email from a third party, a slightly insensitive comment, people stopping their conversations when you walk past...i'm fairly certain that my peers cope with these things just fine. but almost every time they happen to me my day is ruined and i have to constantly seek reassurance from people that everything is alright.i wish i could learn to just let go of these things instead of them going around my head like a sock in a washing machine for the rest of the day...
dae's anxienty always make you assume that poeople are mad at you?
i came to my dorm today to find my roommate studying for his finals so we only greeted each other, i sat down and let him study. he didn't talk to me much either cus obviously, he was studying.the whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. my subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like he's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!this happens more than i'm willing to admit. the fact that i'm completely socially incompetent and often misread social cues doesn't help at all. anyone else like that?
dae purposely stay up late so that they are so exhausted when they try to sleep instead of tossing & turning due to anxiety?
i am in college and i purposely stay up late studying so that i am so exhausted that i’ll go to sleep a lot easier than actually trying to get some sleep and dealing with my thoughts about everything i should’ve/should done/do. edit: thank you guys for all making me feel not alone in this

does anyone else get really anxious when talking on the phone or when receiving calls?

yesterday i had a panic attack at the dentist.
yesterday i wasn’t doing so well. i’m switching anxiety medications, so i’m going through a bit of withdrawal which isn’t fun. i thought about cancelling my dental appointment, but decided to go anyway. one of the nurses heard me state that i was having a bit of a panic attack, and i might need to do the x-rays another time. she took me back to the x-ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. we talked for a while, and she told me i was very strong. she told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. she actually started crying a bit, and i asked if i could hug her, which she accepted. after my appointment, i sat in my car for a while just thinking. i called my mom to tell her about it, and she started crying too. it’s nice to know i’m never alone. 
anyone else love automated self checkout?
many us grocery stores now have self checkout. i can talk with strangers but being able to put on my noise cancelling headphones and use the self checkout is much easier. no having to interact with people. 
i got a job that suits my anxiety!
i'm very ecstatic, i got a job that literally fits around my anxiety! a family member of mine talked to another friend who works at an auto parts shop and she said she completely understands what i'm going through and the company will take me on! all i do is deliver parts and sweep that's it full time 8 to 5! not only that but they're accommodating for my group therapy! 
bro im straight up not having a good time
whenever i think about literally anything ive ever done/said i just cringe... i am a cringe
i've exercised every day for a week now, and i am so proud of myself!
a big part of my anxiety come from how others view me and how fat i am. (167 cm and 85 kg) and as with all anxious thoughts, i know they're a lie but, you know. so i started running at night so the chances of being seen lowered then on day 3, i was passed by another runner and instead of thinking, i got more motivated. now i run during dusk which is an improvement i didn't expect.it's a small step for a regular person, but a giant leap for me.edit: thanks for all the support! it actually gonna make it even easier to run tonight!
when people say “trust your gut feeling” means something so different to people with anxiety.
not that i expect everyone to understand, but when people ask what your gut feeling is about something, i literally have to shut it down, because my gut feeling is always anxiety??? and i over analyze my gut feeling so much that it turns into negative. i know there’s obvious things that call for going with your intuition, but people who don’t have anxiety don’t realize that we over analyze and fear most decisions. even when we know what we want, we still fear being wrong. anybody else? 
telling someone with anxiety to calm down, is like telling someone with allergies to stop and smell the roses.
just thought i'd share this showerthought.. 
i did it
i had my first day of college, and it went well, made it out alive so yay me. ok thank you for reading have a good day :)
does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?
one of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. i fear getting scolded more than i fear my future career. even if i know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, i get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. i submitted something in late and i was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that i paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. it's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. i was scolded once by a strict coach when i was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. after that one encounter, i was so scared that i would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice. 
i stay up late every night because going to sleep means i'll wake up and have to deal with tomorrow
it's usually getting in to work that's the hardest.i've  started zoloft again and hopefully that will get it under control.but that anxiety wall starts building as the sun goes down.what am i going to mess up at work tomorrow? what will i get in trouble for?. i think it just feels good to share. i'll get over the wall. i just need to make a few runs at it. 
who else regroups in the bathroom?
when i'm in panic mode or etc., i find bathrooms to be a useful place to get somewhere alone for a minute to regroup. only downside? my in-laws think i have bowel issues lol.
anyone have “career anxiety”?
i have a constant worry that my current job or prospective jobs are not the “right” decision for my own career development.
does anyone else feel physically weak and tired after going through a long period of anxiety that eventually died down temporarily?
i had a terrible week. i couldn't bring myself to do much of my school work on time because of my anxiety. by thursday, i managed to calm myself down significantly but i'm feeling the consequences at the moment. my body is sore, my neck and head hurt constantly, and once 8 pm hits, i feel like dropping unconscious to sleep (that's how tired i am). is this normal?edit: u/itchyleftarm mentioned that this effect is general adaption syndrome. here's an article in case anyone was interested: [https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome)
anyone else just randomly feel like they’re not getting enough oxygen? it just comes out of nowhere
i feel like i might be breathing wrong or might have something wrong with my lungs. i’m not too sure it’s because of anxiety, but i end up having to stop everything i’m doing just to breathe. it’s like regular breathing isn’t enough and i need more oxygen. it feels like there’s a bag over my head.
i signed up for reddit a year ago this december. it took me almost the entire year to overcome my anxiety about posting for the first time
i know it doesn’t look like much, but this post was almost one year in the making. anxiety is a bitch.edit: my most heartfelt thanks to the kind redditors that have twice endowed me with silver! you guys are seriously amazing  thank you for all the kind words and messages of encouragement.also, words
has anyone found that their ability to read text, write, and spell drastically goes down when anxious?
just something that has been happening too much lately and was wondering if this could be contributed to anxiety.
i got rid of facebook and instagram today after 8 years.
i couldn't feel better, it's like a weight has been lifted off me and alot of stressful ties cut. now i can live in the real world without being too sucked into my phone, and the only people that can contact me are the people i want to be able to. for years i lived a very bad life, and now i feel safer it won't come back to bite me.
dont you hate when you wake up and know its going to be an anxiety day?
so much is changing and i don't like change, i also don't like confrontation. there's both right now in my life. my husband is starting a new job today and a teacher at work has some stupid beef with me for making a joke. i'm having a hard time dealing with it all at once, it feels like i can't breatheany tips would be greatly appreciated
i get anxiety from posting/commenting on reddit.
this sounds so silly, but can anyone relate? i want to contribute to conversations/post things but i worry about downvotes. how stupid is that? it shouldn’t matter. but here i am, worrying that this post will embarrass me. and if i do post or comment, i seriously worry about it and if i look stupid. like i’m a complete stranger to everyone anyway. please tell me i’m not a total freak. the only time i can comfortably post is if i’m drunk and that results in me usually deleting them. and i shouldn’t drink anyway. i just wanted to get that off my chest.edit: i should probably add that i’ve been drinking and that’s why i had the courage to post this because i’m a fucking coward.edit #2: i found out this same issue was posted recently. sorry!
toby allen created these little cartoons called demons of mental illness. this is the one for anxiety. (i really hope it's okay that i'm posting this). thought you guys might like it.

been awake since 4am, couldn't eat all day, major anxiety attacks ...was successful at my interview and got a promotion!
it's been a long time and a bad year but i finally realised my goal and i succeeded at an interview today! edit: you guys are awesome!  thank you all it's proper made my day the kind words on here!
does anyone else fear phonecalls?
basically, i have to admit, i struggle with calls, whether it's incoming or if i have to make one. i become all hot and shivery all of the sudden, and i can feel my pulse going nuts. it's something confronting, putting you on the spot about calls, that makes me extremely nervous - it's like taking oral exam without having prepared for it. can anyone relate? does anyone have ideas on why this fear might exist or how to overcome it?
dae have the problem where anxiety causes them to not want to do work which just causes the stress around work piling up which just makes the anxiety worse
i have this big problem where i randomly get anxiety with no clear triggers (likely not the only one) and it causes me to not do any work since my body refuses to do anything. this delay of work causes me to worry about not getting it done and then i get anxious about it sitting around which then makes the problem worse. eventually i just end up not doing it which hurts my grades and career which then makes my anxiety worse. i now have so much regret and just want to reset my life, but i know that's not how it works.i'm sure i'm not the only one with this problem so this is honestly more of a rant than anything. my doctor doesn't want to give me any medication even though i have tried all his other techniques. luckily i've had hives these last few weeks due to the anxiety and i now have a meeting with my doctor tomorrow to discuss options so maybe i can finally get my life on track.sorry for the long an unnecessary post, but i'm really hoping someone here relates and can help.i apologize too much. sorry.edit: since a lot people have seen this, i just want to say thank you to everyone who has commented and shared with me. while i am sorry you deal with it, too, i am glad i am not alone in this. not sure if anyone cares, but i just got off the phone with my doctor and he is finally giving me something so i am unbelievably happy. thanks again, everyone.
i got a 4.0 this semester in college!
 i don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but i got two a+s and two a's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! i've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. i had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but i did it. i'm at a relatively difficult college and i even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. i also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. i genuinely don't have friends at college or groups i belong in. i have depression alongside this shit anxiety and i went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.it may not be much, but i did it, and i made it through. and you guys can, too! please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. if you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! get doctor's notes. most professors are more understanding than you'd think. y'all got this! i hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.
people who laugh, yell, and mock the people with anxiety and panic disorders are sad people.
they have no idea what we have been through or why we have such disorders. truly people these days have 0 empathy and yes i mean empathy not respect. no one does anymore not police not nurses and hell definently not most of the general population.
wake up feeling fine until i remember to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?
hi all, recently i've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. i've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where i've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. it's weird - i'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment i realize i'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and i just start accumulating it right then and there. what the hell is up with this? i'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like i can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. i think this started while i was having a rough time with a friend recently. that situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. can anyone relate to this? i'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. i don't want to feel like i can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ 
i posted the other day about getting a job. today was my first day i was so nervous last night i didn’t fall asleep til 3:30 and i worked from 8am to 5:30pm. i am scheduled for 38 hours this week i think they liked me i am so proud guys ☺️ you can do it. even if you’re craaaaazy stressed.

i hope you guys like…get to live the life you want to live and i hope nothing haunts you for too long and i hope you’re all kind to yourselves. let’s all hang in there.

look for the helpers...

the worst thing for me about having generalized anxiety is i have anxiety about my anxiety.
i constantly feel the need to explain to people why i constantly over think or internalize everything. i don't want people to think i'm this crazy, narcissist that thinks the world revolves around me so i explain that i have pretty severe anxiety issues.... and then i worry that i'm that annoying person who constantly feels the need to justify their actions or statements by leaning heavily on a health issue.... so then i apologize for bringing it up so much. my anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. i just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and i can't stop analyzing everything that i said or did throughout the day. it went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so i deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. why do i care so much about what other people think? why do i worry so much about how i come across to others? it's exhausting.i'm feeling shity, might delete later. idk 
something i really gotta get off of my chest!
you are awesome. you matter. and i love you even if i don’t even know you. keep moving forward because you’re worth it!!! <3
the biggest problem with anxiety is that it's hard to tell when problems you're having is actually caused by anxiety
case in point:&#x200b;i've had a tension-like headache for two fucking weeks and none of the doctors i've seen know what's causing it. &#x200b;anxiety? could be.&#x200b;not anxiety? could be.&#x200b;brain tumor? probably. (this is a joke, but you guys probably get it.)&#x200b;that's just making the anxiety worse. 
i hate it when being worried about anxiety related chest pains causes even more chest pains.

i start a new job tomorrow. wish me luck 
i don't have a lot of people to celebrate this milestone with, but i knew y'all would understand the significance. i'm anxious af, but also excited. i think this is going to be good.update: it went really really well! thanks everyone for your support ❤️ i appreciated all of your comments. they helped me stay calm.
anyone else feel so anxious yet they instantly sober up/relax when other anxious people are in need of your emotional support?
as the title says, i find that in really tough situations where i'm having a bad day - i instantly feel less tense when i see someone else suffering from severe anxiety. in fact, i always reach out to them (here and irl) and offer them advice which makes me feel better too. now if only i took my own advice seriously...
anxiety is like having a toddler scream in your ear 24 hours a day. zoloft is a set of headphones that lets you ignore it occasionally, but doesn't actually do anything to calm the screaming.

didn't go to a party due to anxiety and now i have anxiety because i didn't go
this is so silly but there was a little party today at my university and my stomach was twisting in knots about going so i skipped it even though my sorta-friends were going. i just stayed at home for hours pretty much doing nothing, feeling sad for no reason, but i was under the impression we would all go to a club tonight anyways so i figured i'd save up my social energy for that. and my roommates came home and don't want to go to the club anymore, so now i'm feeling awful and anxious and so sad that i didn't go, i should have gone and now i have so much regret and anxiety that i missed out. i think i would have had so much fun but yet again i feel like i missed out, and wasted my night. this keeps happening, i really have to get better at forcing myself to just do things...
one of my favorite phrases my therapist told me to keep in mind when i start to feel anxious...
he said, “you want to notice your thoughts as they float down the river of your mind, without getting swept away by them.”just “noticing” my anxious thoughts, not entertaining them nor judging or analyzing them helps me to de-escalate my worries before they turn into a full blown panic attack. i hope this helps in some way.
does anybody feel anxious to the point where they want to vomit?
it happens to me every day and i don’t even know where my anxiety is coming from. edit: wow. thank you everyone for commenting and giving advice (honestly did not expect to get an answer)! i hope you can all pull through and feel better <3
anxiety is like constantly having that feeling you have when you see the police while driving.

any other chronic jaw clenchers here?
i woke up this morning with awful pain in my teeth because i spent the night with my jaw locked shut. i do this when i’m stressed. i also tend to grind my teeth. i’m always so tense! my teeth are in a world of hurt today.
slow down. it may feel like you have to keep up with the fast pace of everyone around you but you absolutely do not have to.
i've been more mindful about the speed of which i talk at, and i've noticed that i think i may be talking at a speed i'm not too comfortable at. maybe it's my unconscious nature to do so, in order to 'keep up' with people. i hope to get in the habit of slowing my speech down just a tad so as to stumble and stutter less. i've also been trying to think more about the state of my body. is your body relaxed right now? do you shake your leg? why aren't you still? unless you're exercising, you should be still and calm. 
just discovered this subreddit. seeing all your posts gave me tears of joy, knowing that i'm not alone. thank you all, your posts help all of us lurkers.

the wheel of anxiety (new comic i made)

does anybody else feel mentally exhausted from battling with there anxiety constantly?
people use the term ‘mentally exhausted’ and i’ve never understood what they ment, but i do now, i’ve had severe anxiety and daily panic attacks for 6 years now (turned 26 yesterday) and for my birthday my girlfriend arranged for us to go on holiday for 4 days, which of course on 1 hand i need the break, but on the other i didn’t want to be killing the holiday by not wanting to do stuff, so i got myself some backup valium to carry around with me in case my anxiety was to get to a point where i could not cope, i’m on my last night now going home in the morning and i did not end up having a single tablet other than my daily propranolol, and i’m super proud of myself i have did everything from going to fair grounds to shopping in busy town centres and markets, i’ve been out from morning until night every day, which is obviously good, it has took me so long to get to this point and it has not been without it’s set backs, and i mean really bad set backs ones where i feel like i’m back at square 1 again, but i always dust myself off and start again, but recently i feel like my brain could do with a rest, i’ve had panic attacks daily while i’ve been here but you would of never been able to tell, my symptoms seem to change every now and then, at the moment mine are- not being able to take a deep satisfying breath or yawn, pains in my chest and pressure in my head, and insomnia, but you no what guys i’m happy believe it or not i just wish i could be normal again, but until then  i will just keep plodding on and hopefully get there 1 day. 
anyone else forget how to walk when someone is walking behind you?

does anybody else find themselves clicking the 'discard post' button a lot because they are afraid of being judged?
edit: wow, i didn't know that many people had the same issue. thanks for everyone's feedback!
does really bad weather soothe anyone else's anxiety?
for a very long time now any time there's a bad storm or something, it makes my anxiety go down so much. to the point i like to put on storm sounds when i sleep at night. i really don't get it, i was deathly afraid of storms when i was a kid. but i check the weather all the time to see when it's going to storm. i sleep better and even feel better and more energized all day. i hope i'm not alone.
a simple gif that may help you through an attack

does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?
i know it is a mental illness in itself but i’m talking about constantly feeling “off”.. like way less intelligent than you used to be, hard to process your thoughts in to words so they come out jumbled or silly sounding, constant headaches and just feeling like you’re on autopilot looking in to someone else’s life.. idk i’ve been dealing with this for 2+ years and i still find it hard to believe it’s just anxiety. i’m terrified it is something else that the doctor’s are missing which i’m sure is just anxiety fueled hypochondria lol. 
it’s that time again.
just in case nobody has told you in a while, unclench your teeth.  relax your shoulders.  take some deep breaths through your nose, hold them for a few seconds, and release them.  now, just breath until you’re able to sink in to your bed or your seat with your eyes closed. whatever is stressing you can wait for a few minutes.  you deserve peace.
do any of you hate loud sounds?
having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. my anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but i'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result i pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. even if it's a noise i'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. i absolutely hate balloons. if i attend a party and there are balloons on the floor i'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. in my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. back when i lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every thursday and i ensured i was never in the building at that time. it was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. i definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is i'm not too sure. do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?
anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.
like right now i’m freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and i’m at a friends house, it’s 4:00 am and i’m cold and i don’t have a blanket but i don’t wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. i’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because i’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. same thing happened when i spilled juice on a table at school. i started hyperventilating over spilled juice. and in slightly more serious situations, i feel totally numb and i disassociate. it’s like i’m not there and my life isn’t real. i had to confront my professor about a paper i didn’t turn in yet and when i was about to talk to him, i started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and i started to disassociate. i’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/dae question that probably doesn’t even make sense. i just hate myself for being like this and i just wanted to get me feelings out.
dae experience 'burnout' for several days after one very rough day?
after a day where i'm an absolute mess and have to push through some very tricky anxiety i'll end up feeling burned out for about 2 weeks afterwards. i struggle to eat and i wake up exhausted every morning and feel dizzy and in general have a much higher baseline of anxiety that usual.anyone else have this? could it be something like adrenal fatigue?
anyone else think they come off as rude in social settings because you're too scared to talk, resulting in silence?
sometimes i just don't know what to say when i talk to people, so i just stay silent. i know people have told me i come off snobby or rude when i don't speak to them, but sometimes i don't know what to say to them or i'm too anxious to talk. i've had people tell me they thought i hated them initially because i wouldn't talk to them. that totally was not the case. does anybody else feel like this?
my supervisor remembered my mood scale!
i track my moods in my journal each day, from red, orange, yellow, green, and blue for an awesome day. it came up maybe once in a conversation how i track my anxiety levels.today was a rough day and my supervisor asked  what kind of day it is. i told her orange leaning towards red, but it really meant a lot that she remembered and wanted to know how to make it better.might be minor, but i think it shows how having supportive people around can be so helpful. the day is looking up at least.sending good vibes ❤️
does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?
i’ve been anxious since i was a kid. it’s been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. i just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but i have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all i can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. anything more and i either feel extremely nauseous or i start gagging when trying to eat. these last few months i have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me i look good. which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that i know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that i have no idea how to deal with. my question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? and if so what do you do about it?
does anyone else get anxiety when someone doesn’t talk to them? like mine gets so bad like “oh they don’t like me anymore” or “oh they don’t wanna talk to me anymore” when that’s probably not the case. idk how to handle it

dont be me. a message to young people with anxiety.
im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. i thought i could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. work falling away. if i could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' i will let tommorow feel far away.except my tommorow has come. living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. only my phone and a cat by my side. i let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.dont be me. deal with your issues. dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. dont be me.edit. thanks for all the replies. ive often advised others not to lose hope, and i will now take that advice. dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again.
its a saturday night, i'm at home and bored. i'm gonna go out alone and see if i have fun, wish me luck!
-editthanks everyone for the support, i had a fun night and didn't have any anxiety at all, it was uncharted territory for me because i moved to this city about 3 weeks ago and i don't know anyone who lives close to me. seeing all the replies telling me to have fun definitely made it much more fun too because, i accept that i'm a bit of a attention whore. thanks again everyone, i love this subreddit.
i asked to change the tv at the doctors
i was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. i thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. i wanted to change it to cnn but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. so i changed it to local news. so now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming i can be cured by allowing jesus into my heart.but i did it!! i'm really proud of myself.
after years and years of putting it off, i finally made an appointment with a counselor.
i don't really have anyone to tell, and this is a major accomplishment for me. i almost feel like crying. i don't have a good reason why i didn't do this sooner, but i'm really happy that i finally did.    edit: holy cow, i was not expecting all this overwhelming love and support. thank you all so much. i really do appreciate each and every one of you. i've never seen a more supportive subreddit. thank you. :')
something i wrote while experiencing crippling anxiety

does anyone else find that once you get rid of one source of anxiety, another will immediately replace it?
i've been doing a lot better lately with not panicking over work and social events and making life plans. but i am getting weird anxiety over how i look and feeling super self conscious about my appearance all the time.i've no idea why, it's not been much of an issue before. i definitely don't need a new thing to worry about! it's so exhausting that stresses like this never seem to truly stop, even when i think i'm getting better. edit: i finally managed to read all these comments now i'm home from work. thank you everyone for making me feel like i'm not on my own in this! some of you have made me think i might need to try the doctor/therapist route again because i think i can only get so far on my own. overall though, today was a good day! i hope you have all had a good day too :)
probably gonna get lost in here.... but
a few months later, i went back  to the restaurant where i had a massive panic attack while with friends, and ate a meal on my own!edit: can't believe this got so much attention. thanks guys :) and thank you for silver!
i did all my laundry, cleaned my room, and turned in all my assignments today.
obviously what normal people can do on a regular basis, and i'll probably be withdrawn from law school for absences, but today i am doing ok. love u all and wish the best for you.
i get anxiety during anxiety about myself wasting my life having anxiety and not being able to enjoy it. wasting precious time. literally anxiety about anxiety? how do i break this loop?
i get the physical sensations of anxiety each morning i wake up. doesn’t matter what i do. cbt, meditation, mindfulness, meds (although no more) etc.this in turn sets the tone for the day no matter what i do, then i get upset that i always feel like my body thinks it’s dying in fight or flight.it drains me and fatigues me and then i make mistakes at work and affects my attention span. then i always end up being in a state of having more anxiety because i’m scared about always having anxiety..
i deactivated my facebook and my anxiety had decreased by so much!
the daily pressures of seeing everyone’s posts and keeping up on every ones lives. i’m over the drama. i feel great no longer having facebook! i highly suggest taking a break from social media for a while if you’re feeling overwhelmed with life.
who else is tired of anxiety?

hey, i noticed

to anyone spending christmas alone due to their anxiety - hang in there.

i love sleep. my life has the tendency to fall apart when i'm awake, you know? ernest hemingway

this is me today. in fact, this is me most days.

did your child self think that your adult self would be completely confident and have it all figured out?
when i (f26) was in school i always imagined that by mid-20s i’d be completely comfortable in my own skin and wouldn’t give a shit about what other people thought. i just assumed that came with being an adult. yet here i am, still feeling like i’m at the bottom of the food chain in social situations, and still just as anxious and doubtful of myself as i was 10 years ago.it’s so weird. on paper i’ve achieved so many of the things i had hoped for myself... i should feel good about myself by now, or at least have enough evidence that i’m not a total piece of shit. childhood me would be saying “how can you still not believe in yourself? how can you still be living so fearfully?” at this point i honestly don’t know what it will take to prove to myself that i am a perfectly capable human being. anxiety wins every time.edit: thank you so much for all of your responses!!! i resonate with so many of you and it’s comforting to know i’m not alone in this!! i started cbt a few weeks ago and can’t say it’s been particularly helpful so far, but i plan to stick it out and hope for the best. 
just got engaged!
i was so so nervous but it went well and she said yes. so happy. 
anyone else? -_-

im tired of people saying there has to be a reason why i'm anxious.
can i not wake up anxious or it suddenly come on? people act like oh you're fine if you have no specific reason for the anxiety. i have generalized anxiety disorder and binge eating disorder. i can't help it sometimes and when i talk to someone about it, they brush it off like it's not a big deal because i can't figure out why i'm anxious. i woke up wanting to eat my whole fridge today. is there really a giant reason? no. people say just eat then. they don't understand that if i do right now, idk if i can stop myself. you know? it goes with ocd too. you can't stop thinking about it until you act on the obsession.sorry for that rant. if anyone would like to talk about it, i'd be happy to possibly make some new friends!

small victory: i managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.
every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. i've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and i've been trying to figure out how to cope. happiness/contentment does seem far away and even impossible at times, and in the case today, it led to nearly catastrophic panic attack today.i'll admit, it's been a long while since i've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but i least i can take solace in the fact that i recognized the signs before things got out of control. being able to understand, hey, listen, you're having a panic attack, and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating. i was able to stop the attack, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't still under high anxiety right now.
worst time for an anxiety attack
got pulled over today. i've been pulled over a few times before nothing scary. today was different though. after the officer walked up to my car i started having a horrible anxiety attack. the officer noticed me shaking and started to press for why i was so nervous. he went back to his car to run my information and a second squad car pulled up. they both walked up and told me i needed to get out because something wasn't right with me and they needed to investigate. as soon as i explained the anxiety and depression i've been battling and showed them my new medication that i recently started. as soon as they saw that they completely shifted and asked if i needed any resources for them and were wanting to get an emergency crisis officer out there to talk with me and get me help. i've already have been getting help, but for some reason it was meaningful how much they wanted to make sure i wasn't going to do anything to myself.
aced a phone interview and i can’t stop smiling. phone anxiety sucks
three years ago you would’ve never seen me pick up a phone. and in the rare moments i did, i’d either pass the phone to my family, or i’d be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. i’d blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. it would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. and then i got to a point where i got tired of it. i was entering university and i couldn’t even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. so then i asked my friends and family to help. i took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. they’d be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. and then once i started gaining just a little bit of confidence, i pushed myself to make calls to other people. sure i had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so i could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. i started making calls. from booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, i did it, and the pride i felt every time after the call was unexplainable. i still had those thoughts though, of the things i could’ve said better, the ways i could’ve changed my tone. but ultimately i reminded myself after each phone call about what i conquered. i just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. i didn’t write a script for it. instead, i just did everything i would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best i could. and then i just answered the phone call and had a conversation. at points my voice was shaky, but i know i have yet to grow. i ended up getting another interview - in person! which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so i’m hopeful it goes well. i understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but i swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. if anyone ever needs, i’m here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. we can do this!!
anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?
it’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that i get from my anxiety. it’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe i ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. i think out of all the anxiety symptoms i’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. i’ve already ruled many out other causes, and i know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. i just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. i can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally everything 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. no matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. it makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. it just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. i don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. i don’t need to be told that i need medication or therapy. i’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. no, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. no, i can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea. i know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don’t help.
does anyone else here creates arguments in mind and hypothetical scenarios which affects you emotionally?
whenever i think of some little scenarios which really is happening then later on my mind make it worse like it creates arguments with somebody and i feel like it is real like i felt it emotionally then things got even worse when negative thoughts coming out and i feel if that would happen it would be my fault. there were also times that i even felt i was about to cry just by thinking those things. can somebody please tell me what i am going through.
does anyone else feel completely disconnected from who they used to be?
i’ve been experiencing the beginnings of an attack for the past hour or so and all i can think of is that i’m not “me” anymore. like i’ve left home before i was ready. i keep remembering that i used to like playing music in bands, i used to like to have fun with friends, i used to have hope and make plans, i used to laugh and joke a lot...i used to be someone else. now, im somewhere else and i feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. it’s so hard to put into words how i’m feeling. it’s like... everything is blank. empty. and nothing feels real at all. like, i’m living someone else’s life. and what i do, what i say, what i feel- is irrelevant and pointless. i just want to go home and be who i used to be. but i know i can’t. that person is forever gone. changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. and finding out the cause of this is impossible. there’s no trigger. there’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. it doesn’t ever stop. i’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and i think i’m getting worse by the day. it’s like- every day i lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. i just want it all to stop. i miss me so much. edit: wow! i’m almost speechless! thank you all for responding to this. i wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. i kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the no rain video by blind melon. i’ve found my people! and though i’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way i do- i feel a bit more fortified that i’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! we got this!
isn't anxiety great when all you want to do is sit around because you're mentally exhausted but your brain convinces you that you're going to get cancer/heart disease/fucking every illness ever from not exercising
but you still don't exercise bc you're exhausted and have no motivation to do anything and then there's this endless cycle of beating yourself up? absolutely love it.
i'm so f**ing sick of being told just breathe when i'm anxious

does anyone else get tired of people telling them to exercise as if thats a cure-all?
i know exercise is a wonderful tool, and can be great at helping get rid of that excess energy while also helping maintain good health. but sometimes it feels like being told have you ever considered exercising or dieting? invalidates my current efforts to healing myself. i'd just like to be supported for finally reaching out to a psychiatrist and therapist. 
does anybody else purposely listen to music they enjoyed when they were younger, as it reminds them of a time when they were not adversely affected by anxiety?

does anyone else get really bad anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone?
i have trouble making calls or even answering the phone for important conversations. i can’t rationalize it at all, but every time my phone rings i just get this terrible knot in my stomach and let it go to voicemail to avoid the conversation. does anyone else experience anything similar? if so, do you have any tips for how to deal with this?
some things that help reduce my anxiety that might help you...
1. i eat a big breakfast in the morning (eggs, bacon) it helps me feel much better without fail. when i go with out breakfast i tend to feel far more anxious.2. i drink camomile tea before bed. or when i feel stressed. it soothes me and really does calm me down and help me sleep.3. i listen to ocean or fireplace sounds i.e [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmgsqklb4yg&t=13s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmgsqklb4yg&t=13s) calms my thoughts down and makes me feel safe.4. i lift light weights, not for anything serious but to just shake this anxiety off.5. drink plenty of water throughout the day.6. sit in the sun for a few minshope this helps a few people out there. stay strong.
anyone imagine who they could be if they weren’t crippled by anxiety?

anyone else call in sick for work because of extreme anxiety and you're exhausted from trying to act 'normal'? and then feel really guilty? argh!
i guess the title says it all :/
does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? read more inside.
what’s up y’all, hope you are all doing well.recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. i was reflecting on who i used to be and what i used to think about when i was a young immature boy in high school and i realized something.my mind used to be so creative and curious back then. i’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.now that i am older i have realized my mind has lost that spark. the only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what i did in the past, what i’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if i’m doing good enough.i just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if i did the right thing or if i fucked up in life.it’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. these thoughts only breed the same thoughts. so i’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? thanks.
does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?
**edit:** wow i didn't think i'd get this many comments. i'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! i used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. i'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. i especially have this with groups of teenagers, i'm genuinely afraid of them lolif i'm in a group i might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.what's your experience been with this? did you eventually get over it? 
i finally did it!
for lunch today i went out to my local mcdonald’s, and i actually sat down and ate my food inside, without any friends or family there! my main thing is i hate going places alone because i feel like everyone is watching me, but when i was eating i just focused on eating and texting my friends. i’ve been meaning to apply for a job, but i don’t know if i’ll be able to walk into the store to ask about it.
i’ve applied for two jobs!!
i just wanted to share some good news. i’ve always been terrified of getting a job, but i’m trying my best to be brave. i’ve applied for a job at a grocery store, and i just applied for a job at a doggy daycare. i feel like because i don’t have any past experience it’s going to be really hard to get a job but i’m going to just apply anyway. better to try and to fail, than to not try at all. i’m so scared of getting a job but i really want to get moving forward in life. wish me luck!! edit: ahhhhh thank you all for your support i’m so happy and excited!!! i’ll probably post when i get a job!! time to make me some money!! 
to everyone reading this ...
to everyone reading this, thank you for still being here. anxiety is a bitch! nobody likes the draining feeling in your gut. that shakiness in your hands. that awful self-doubt. you are here! you’re defeating it every time you open your eyes the next morning. keep in mind that you are a fierce ass human being! only you can do what you can do! you are powerful, you are strong. and you are deserving of love! have a wonderful day today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and onward! fuck anxiety!
a week with no panic attacks!!
this time in january i was having debilitating panic attacks literally every day/all day and lost so much weight and became almost underweight because of it...6 months later, i am in therapy and on medication and just reached my first week without a single panic attack in 6 months, in addition to getting back to a healthy weight!! wooooo!
is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?
hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but i just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.anyway, i can only really come out of my shell once i'm drunk, i'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless i am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life i suppose.but when i finish drinking, oh boy do i worry too much. for example, last night i was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now i'm really worried about what kinda impression i gave to some people and whether or not i said something offensive. i know i at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. i also worry i bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down. sorry for the rant, and thanks for your time if you did choose to read through this, i hope you all lead long, fulfilling lifes.p.s. idk if i should start going to counselling for issues like this, do you think it could be beneficial to someone like me?
in 3 hours it'll only be 1 hour until i have to go to work... in 2 hours it'll only be 1 hour... in 1 hour...
why am i like this? i don't go in until 4 for my part time job, yet it's like work controls my entire day even when i'm not there. i want to be productive on my own time here at home, but i can't seem to relax enough to get out of bed and stop looking at my phone.
i did it!! i left my house for the day and had fun!
today was a really really good day, i left my house for like 11 hours!!! i got past my anxiety and just smiled through the day. i'm sitting on my couch right now after a long day away from home and i feel so calm and sort of relieved. i feel happy, happy that this day was actually really good. my god i almost never leave my house and when i do my head turns into chaos but today it was just calmness. i'm so so surprised. most of all i'm proud of myself :d i feel great!!!
sometimes i hate being alone but when i finally go out with people i can’t wait to go back home and be alone again. it’s like i want to be more social but then think maybe i don’t really want this. anyone else feel this way?

downvotes make me extremely scared about what i said wrong
no, this is not an excuse to stop downvotes. they have a purpose on reddit, i realize that.as frivolous as this may seem, i want to know if im not the only one who thinks this.though it might seem like something small, at the end of a tough day its the last push into a deep hole of sadness.i read through my own post or comment multiple times to see whats wrong before deleting it anyway.its a minor thing that can leave a bitter taste in my mouth. 
going non verbal when you're upset/stressed?
does anyone else go nonverbal when theres too much going on and your stressed out and have major sensory overload. i was forced to a family members house for the holidays and i just want to cry, there is absolutely no privacy, only two bedrooms so i dont even get to escape the people and socialization because my bedroom is the couch. i can hear every noise anyone in this house makes and i just want to punch something. when i get like this it feels physically impossible to talk and people just keep talking to you even though you clearly dont want to. this was just a little bit of a rant because i needed it, but i was wondering if anyone else goes non verbal in stressful situations.
does anyone else shut down when being yelled at?
(m24) whenever my mom is in a bad mood or pissed at someone or something. i feel like as if i have to walk on eggshells around her. if i take too long to do something or do it wrong she yells at me. don’t get me wrong i love my mother to pieces but when she’s yelling at me my mind kind of shuts off, i can’t even think of a response and even if i do it never comes out right. i start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100. then i get the usual thoughts of being useless, a failure etc. the rest of the day i feel like absolute garbage and i accomplish nothing other than laying in my bed. does this happen to anyone else? have you found a way to deal with it and not feel like trash?
ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?
i'm a bit of a history buff, and i made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently. naturally they discussed things like the holocaust, the red terror, and other atrocities of that era.  that shit really gets to me, and lately i've found myself being overly sensitive to every terrible thing on the news as a result.  a college girl goes missing, a boy is murdered by his step-dad, etc; you get the drift.  it can be a little over whelming sometimes.  i just don't understand how human beings are capable of doing such horrible things to one another.does anyone else struggle to process this stuff, and how do you deal with it?**edit: i've been reading all of your comments for the last day, and i just wanted to thank everyone.  you tend to *assume* people feel the same way you do on common sense issues like this, but actually seeing individual responses and everyone's different ways of coping is very therapeutic.  it's nice to know i'm not alone.**
does anyone else get anxiety when they are waiting on someone to answer them?
whenever i send text messages and it takes someone an unusual amount of time to answer i find myself getting more and more anxious. to the point where i start being concerned for their health and well being, and then to the point of convincing myself they are mad at me or don’t want to talk to me anymore. what do you guys do to calm down in a situation like and not let your mind go crazy?
i stole this from another site, but it's pretty accurate imo. anybody else get this response from others? this pretty much describes why all my relationships have failed. i have yet to meet someone who understands fully, let alone date them.

i asked for a different lid today
today i went to starbucks, ordered my drink and with little hesitation asked for one of the lids without a straw. now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. after that i went to my first ever lash lift appointment. i was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. i laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. i knew from the beginning i had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, i had no idea how i would react. once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. i immediately started to feel dizzy and like i needed to open my eyes immediately. now, a few years ago i would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because i didn’t want to bother her. today, i very politely explained to her that i needed to have it taken off and i would still pay her for the service. she was so kind and understanding that she didn’t charge me for anything and told me i could always come back and try again another day. again, to some people this would sound like a failure. i failed to complete the treatment and i felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. but, i asked for a different lid today. and that’s a win in my book.
my anxiety makes me feel that i am running out of time and i am only 21
i constantly keep giving myself markers or what i should be doing at my age, or what i should have accomplished till i am say 25, find love. i keep feeling like i could have achieved so much till my age but i didn't and now there's no going back. it's like my 20s are the years i must do everything, be the best version of myself but i constantly fail to do so, because of which i am and will remain a failure.i feel like i'm running out of time.
new spin on anxiety: we are just superheros with an extraordinary amazingly functioning fight/flight reaction

90 days.
almost jumped 14 stories 90 days ago. hungover, isolated, ashamed, totally hopeless. it was christmas and i had zero will to live. jumping made total rational sense. the end of all this pointless suffering. but i didn't. i called the hotline. i got help. i saw a psychologist. diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. but also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. he told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.i quit cold turkey. my symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. i'm no longer suicidal. when i get negative automatic thoughts i notice them. when i get in a thought loop i can break out.please, if you are suffering and drinking, give it a try. you have nothing to lose. i am going on a retreat tomorrow and i'll be on a flight for a bit, but i'll answer any questions and reply to all comments.
things anxiety has taken from me
* good memories - i struggle to remember the nice and the fun things. my personal highlight reel is all the times that i did something embarrassing, awkward or badly* ability to make decisions - i can't even plan my day without questioning everything. should i do something more environmentally-friendly? should i invite a friend, and would they even say yes? do i have chores to do instead? do i deserve this? * ability to think clearly - i feel like i live in a fog of questioning everything and feeling sad and cut-off. i don't know what is normal any more. * self-confidence - i went to paris at 18 and china aged 20 where i didn't know anyone. this weekend i haven't been to the music festival at the end of my street because i think it will stress me out too much. * zest for life - i used to plan the things i wanted to do and see, and i'd go travelling at every opportunity. now i'd be quite happy if i could just get through the week without panicking and/or hating myself.sharing to get this out of my system and hope someone else understands.
anyone else get really anxious any time your phone vibrates?
i don’t know why, but any time i get a call or text i just get hit with this wave of anxiety to the point that i don’t even want to pick up the phone and look at it, let alone answer.  anyone else?
7 tips for reducing your anxiety, without taking meds or going to therapy
 if you are feeling hopeless about defeating your anxiety right now, this article i wrote last week could help you. &#x200b;trying to defeat anxiety can feel very overwhelming at times. it can be hard to believe that we will actually be able to overcome it. &#x200b;but you are the only one who can defeat your anxiety. you’re gonna have to do it, no one else. and maybe it’s not as hard as you think. maybe there are some simple steps you can take in your life right now, that will put you on the right path. in this article you’ll discover 7 anxiety tips that you can apply right now. if you follow these tips you’ll be more effective at your work, have better relationships, and be a more happy and peaceful person.&#x200b;# anxiety tip #1 -  stop consuming caffeinecaffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. this neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‘anti-stress vitamin’ b1 (thiamine). for anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. note: the sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. but whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine will make you feel more anxious**. it’s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. &#x200b;# anxiety tip #2 - set specific times in your day to be offlinepeople with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. we might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. you won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online**it’s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you know that you won’t be disturbed**. most people don’t recover well enough from their daily stress. that’s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. we can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we’ll be offline. we should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. &#x200b;# anxiety tip #3 - train yourself to breathe through your stomachscientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‘watch’ our breath. if the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. if the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. it’s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. **breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. and it’s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! if you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. &#x200b;# anxiety tip #4 - tie up loose endsyou could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. we can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. we have mail that we haven’t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven’t checked your bank statements in 2 months. these things are tricky to actually go and do. the longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. but biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. it might spike your anxiety while you’re doing it. but when it’s done you’ll feel much better and lighter. **the less we have on our mind, the less anxious we’ll feel.** &#x200b;# anxiety tip #5 - exercise at least twice a weeknow most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. but a lot of us don’t realise just how critical exercise is. in his ‘*anxiety and phobia workbook*’  e.j. bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. there are many proven benefits to regular exercise. among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. pro tip: exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety&#x200b;# anxiety tip #6 - be in flowathletes call this state ‘being in the zone’, psychologists refer to it as flow. it’s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. if you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. mihaly csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:1. complete **concentration** on the task2. **clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback3. transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)4. the experience is intrinsically **rewarding**5. **effortlessness** and ease6. there is a balance between **challenge and skills**7. actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**8. there is a feeling of **control** over the taskflow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. it makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. it will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.  &#x200b;# anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritualmost people grab their phone the second they wake up. this is about worst thing you can do to start your day. it’s very important we start our day on our own terms. we should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day. create a morning ritual for yourself that calms you and will give you the necessary strength to deal with your anxiety. we shouldn’t sleep on creating a morning ritual! it makes a massive difference if you start your day right. those are my 7 tips for reducing your anxiety right now, so you can be more peaceful and more successful in your relationships, job, and your life.i have no doubt in my mind that you are capable of defeating your anxiety. you are absolutely able to do it. did you think this article was helpful? if you did, comment below on what you would love to learn about defeating anxiety. if it’s something i have experience with, i’ll write my next piece about it.
anxiety disorder is like having a broken house alarm in your mind which consistently goes off despite no apparent threat being present.
just my perspective on it. came up with this when asked about what i/we go through.
i've asked someone to go on a date with me she said yes :)

i cooked a whole meal just for myself today and i know it's not much, but i'm kinda proud.
i like cooking and baking especially, but usually i don't bother just for myself. recently i've been having quite a bit of alone time at home, which honestly usually fires up my anxiety. atm however, it is still necessary for me to be at home a lot, since i just got discharged from a psychiatric ward a week ago and don't feel ready to start working again quite yet. however, i made it my goal to do progressive muscle relaxation every other day, get out of the house for a walk or something similar once a day and try to eat properly. and i have actually done that in the last couple days :) anyway, i just wanted to share with someone who understands and thought of you folk. thanks for reading, pics of the food in the comments if anyone's interested :)
my anxiety should have lost me my job, but my boss is amazing.
i've been dealing with an extreme level of anxiety (like shaking in the morning and throwing up about going to work) and also having other neuro symptoms (disassociation episodes at night, abdominal twitching, and needing an mri). with all the days i couldn't get out of bed or had a doctor's appointments, i should have been fired.however, my boss has been amazing about this. he's been totally good with the appointments, checking up on me when i've had to see specialists and had to change meds. he see's me not only as an employee, but as a person that is trying their best and stuff is just going down. i hope you all get that boss one day.
does anyone else watch tv/youtube to hear/see other people without actually socializing?
i’m introverted and agoraphobic. but i still like being connected with humanity and “interacting” with other people indirectly makes me feel less cripplingly alone and isolated. sometimes i’ll just put something on in the background while i do other things. i just want to hear human voices without the anxiety of being around other people
what anxiety feels like.

does anyone else also understand that their thoughts are irrational yet they coninue to feel anxious?
i sometimes do understand that my anxiety provoking thoughts are irrational, such as thinking i'll never find a job, but the moment i get as much as a little hint supporting this i'll go back to thinking that i'll really never find a job.
living with anxiety is a lot like driving a car that idles high; you can still get out and go places, but you're going to run out of fuel much faster.
best analogy i've come up with so far.
does anyone else get upset and hurt when your posts or comments get downvoted?
i just joined reddit the other day and i’m feeling like it’s really not good for my mental health. whenever something gets downvoted i feel like people are thinking bad things about me or i said something wrong and i feel stupid. it’s like high school social anxiety all over again
is anyone else introverted most of the time, but very extroverted in friend groups or people you're fairly close with?
when i have to be in uncomfortable social interactions (large meetings at work, networking &amp;amp; meeting with possible clients at dinners, etc.) carrying on normal conversation and staying in the pocket is extremely draining.however, in my groups of friends and acquaintances, i'm one of the most talkative, outgoing, and funny people (my opinion) in the group and it makes me feel genuinely happy.what does this mean? i understand that the whole concept of introvert vs extrovert isn't black and white, but what can i learn from this? edit: thanks for the responses. a lot of people are saying things like well yeah that just sounds like social anxiety, or you're more comfortable around your friends so obviously you'll be more yourself but that's not what i'm getting at. i don't just become a normal member of the conversation when i'm comfortable - rather i tend to dominate it. i enjoy it a *lot*. so i'm wondering if the repressing of my own thoughts and words in uncomfortable situations is sort of causing this buildup of social energy which then gets released when i'm comfortable.
i painted the physical manifestation of how i experience anxiety and thought some of you might relate.

hey. hey you. *gives internet hug* it's going to be ok
sometimes all i want is someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be ok. what's frustrating is that if i tell people this i feel like they'll just be doing because i told them i like it, and not because they actually care or because they actually think i'll be ok. ive been lurking a while here and as shitty as it sounds its weirdly comforting to know i'm not alone, so thank you.sorry the body of this post isn't as happy as the title.
anxiety has completely and utterly destroyed the person i was before.
id give almost anything to get my life before back.. :(edit: really didn't think this would get so big. i really appreciate all the love and all of the people reaching out to me. i'm slowly reading through all your comments. thank you.
anybody else feel like they are addicted to rewatching old comedies because the familiarity of it soothes their anxiety?
i definitely feel like rewatching episodes of brooklyn nine-nine and the office soothe my anxiety. and i definitely feel like i use these shoes as a way of distracting myself from the anxiety. i feel it’s because the shows are so familiar to me, and i love the characters so much that they comfort me. i even went through a stage where i would finish b99 and then just click right back onto episode one. can anyone explain why i might do this? does anyone else do the same?
i'm too mentally ill to be a successful person, but too competent to be a total disaster.
and i almost just wish i was a full on fuck up, you know? it somehow feels worse to sit at mediocrity.when i entered college, i had elaborate plans to become a surgeon. i had good grades and i was motivated, even though i had been a little beat up by a rough childhood. five anxiety disorders and two suicide attempts later, i graduated with a gpa so shitty that i will never even hope to be a doctor. not only that, but my biology degree is useless. still, the theme among therapists and everyone around me was at least you graduated!yes, that's what it's come to. at least i graduated. that's totally what i always dreamt my future to be.
i delete posts and comments before posting them, because i fear the reaction. does anyone else get this?
i could write a bunch of text about something, and then i fear that the post/comment will give off the wrong impression.that i sound like an asshole or that i don’t know enough about the subject. edit: just came with another example. me and a group of friends have a snapchat group chat. it’s almost the only way to get in touch with them, so that’s what i use snapchat for.and when i started writing there and then deleted it, i realized how much i delete texts there.it’s like every other text i try to write is deleted by me when i have had enough time coming up with as many reactions to the text as i can.
do you guys ever sit and run through things you've said today and hope you didn't upset or offend someone? or look stupid?

i'm not ok.
i'm not ok.  i tell my family, friends, and coworkers i am, but i am not ok.  six months ago my entire future disappeared and what was left in its place was a quivering mess of anxiety, fear, and depression. i get up every day and act like everything is ok, but i'm not ok.i don't want my teenage son to see how painful relationships can end so i say i'm ok.  i don't want my daughter to worry about me so i smile and say i'm ok.  i don't want my ex to think i'm weak so i say things are good and that i'm ok.  i don't want my family to pity me so i tell them life happens and i'm ok.  but i'm not ok... and that's ok.because i will be ok again one day.  this isn't my first relationship to end.  this isn't the first time i've been here.  this isn't the first time i've felt like this.  i survived all of those, i'll survive this.  as long as i draw breath there's hope.  and because i have hope, i'll be ok.
i finally did my dishes and i didn't get anxiety!
**i just wanted to share this moment with everyone because i am proud.** i usually can't do my dishes without getting a small panic attack/anxiety and today i did not get any anxiety and it went really well. i took my time and it is finally done after weeks on end of procrastinating. i have my laundry done too, bathroom half clean/kitchen half clean and living room half clean. i am almost done! here's to hoping i can stay this motivated and it stays clean haha. *thank you for listening.*
do you ever feel like your anxiety isn't bad enough to be valid?
i'm currently seeing a therapist, who did diagnose me with generalized anxiety (and i struggle a lot particularly with *social* anxiety, as well). however, i constantly feel that my anxiety isn't enough. i don't mean that anxiety is a good thing that we should aspire to have as much of as possible--not at all. it's just that my symptoms and the things that cause me to be anxious coupled with the fact that my anxiety doesn't seem to be as severe as other people's causes me to feel unworthy and unheard. i've never had a panic attack before, and i know several people who with anxiety who have definitely had panic attacks and such. mine has never gotten to that point. i kind of feel like i'm lost--i'm too anxious to function normally, but seemingly not anxious enough to feel like my anxiety is taken seriously by others. it kind of feels like if people don't see your anxiety physically, if you don't wear it on your sleeve, then you must not be struggling. has anyone ever felt this way about their anxiety? i feel invalid, like i don't belong sometimes.
this is a reminder to anyone reading it that you are stronger than your anxiety and you can conquer this day.

i gotta remind myself that it's ok to feel anxious every once in a while. i don't need to beat myself up for feeling this way. i don't need to find relief. or so the reasons why i'm feeling it. just accept it let it pass and life goes on.

does anyone else get anxious when plans are made or changed at the last minute?
i'm a planner. i like to have a schedule and stick to it. i'm not sure if i'm the only one, but i get really anxious when the plans change at the last minute. all of these thoughts in my head: when will we eat? when will i be able to get ready for work? when will i be able to get some rest? will i be a terrible person if i turn someone down? i have to go because otherwise i'm not a good friend. ...and so much more. i wish i could be more flexible. i even have an anti-anxiety backpack with snacks, water, and the essentials and it doesn't help much. sigh, anxiety.
dae clench their teeth subconsciously??

does anyone else have this exact problem?
1. want to talk to someone about overwhelming anxiety2. can't because of overwhelming anxiety&nbsp;fml.
anxious when i’m not doing anything, but too anxious to start because there’s so much to do
i’ve have this problem for sooo long and it’s been holding me back for years. so i want to do a lot of creative things and get good at them. like drawing, painting, dancing, clay jewelry, flow art, making clothes, custom dolls, music production and djing, and probably more. and i know all these things take time to get the hang of but.. i just don’t practice any of them, ever. i’ll wake up and tell myself i’ll practice one of them but get so overwhelmed because in the back of my mind i know there’s so many other things i want to do too. so i just don’t do any of it and waste my time while feeling guilty. it’s like i feel guilty even when i’m “about” to go do it because i know that i won’t get up.
does anyone get embarrassed over the littlest things?
i hate myself. today was supposed to be a good day. i’m at the opera house waiting to watch a ballet performance. i got all dressed up so i could look classy. but the performance hasn’t even started yet and i feel like my day is already ruined.when i got here in the morning, i asked a worker where the rooftop resturaunt was. he told me to go straight and then left, but he wasn’t very clear so i accidentally turned in the wrong direction, and a lady held open the door for me and i said “thank you.” then, the worker said “miss, that’s the wrong direction” and i was so embarrassed. i said “sorry” to the lady and went on my way. (mistake 1)then, i decided not to eat at the restaurant after all, and decided to eat at ladureé. when i was at ladureé i got up to go to the restroom and when i was walking back i slipped on a heel, but luckily i didn’t fall because i held on to the railing. luckily no one noticed, but i felt so embarrassed. (mistake 2)lastly, when i got to the opera house i went to the coat room and gave my coat to the lady to store. she told me to have a good time at the performance and i told her “you too.” i feel so stupid. (mistake 3)i just feel like this day can only get worse and my heart just feels like it’s sinking. i feel like everyone is watching me and judging me. i’m so timid and awkward and scared of what people could me thinking of me. if anyone can give me advice on how to make this stop i would greatly appreciate it. 
shotout to those heading back to work today after a break
i know it’s really hard for me, especially being seen/talking to coworkers after a long break, feeling like they’re judging me. whatever triggers your anxiety at work if you’re heading back in today, my thoughts are with you.
i'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things
you think i choose to feel this way? just don't worry about it wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. amazing advice, thanks.i have some really bad fears that i can't get over and i am just at my breaking point. i don't know what to do anymore
does anyone else have the feeling of being on temporary time? like, things are just weird right now. i'll have everything together soon.
it's hard to describe, so i'll just put it in an example.my hobbies include drawing, writing, and guitar. a while ago, i decided i'd practice one for an hour each day, alternating every day. not bad, right? a solid, simple plan.today, i hardly look at my guitar, and spend a few minutes scribbling on notebook paper before deciding i just don't feel like drawing. i keep telling myself, it's just a weird time, what with all my pending homework. once i get caught up, i'll start practicing. or, usually, things are just strange right now. once this time passes, i'll start.i feel like i'm just stumbling through days, and have no control. i can't keep a plan because i always use the excuse of things aren't right. once [x happens], i'll be ready. right now, i'm waiting until summer break to start my routine. i know that, once summer comes, i'll just make more excuses.does anyone else feel that way? how do you get over the feeling of it's not my fault, things just aren't right? 
this is to all the people who are jobless, skipping classes, or completely hopeless in life because of anxiety disorders
my life is far, very far from perfect. but i want to share something.i graduated high school in 2014. i was a terrible student. i skipped classes like nobody else did. not because i am “lazy”, but because my anxiety was so high that it totally hindered my ability to stay in class. after i graduated, i spent 2015 and 2016 housebound. agoraphobic,  depressed and fucked up, with no perspective in life. i never imagined i could even enter the room where an university entrance exam would be applied. and i mean it. i couldn’t imagine myself there. i couldn’t even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. a miracle happened by the end of 2016. i decided to take an exam, just to train. to see if i could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. i never expected to pass the exam. i never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent i’m from*. i still don’t believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. i still can’t believe i made it.i still have problems. many problems. i am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. however...i am not hopeless anymore. i can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. i can see myself graduating, i can see myself in a job, and i can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. i feel i can make it.please, never, never give up on yourself. even if you are housebound or jobless, skipping all of your classes, even if nobody else around you believe in you, keep going. you are much stronger than you think you are, i guarantee it. i experienced it. just put yourself in a situation where you have the possibility of improving and making some kind of progress.edit: i’m so glad this message somehow helped and inspired some people. i wish the best for all of you. you can and *will* dominate anxiety.
i spent three years hiding in my apartment and then moved to manhattan.
i spent three years in an apartment only going outside for food and other necessities. i played video games all day and watched youtube videos and made art. minimal social interaction. i've been diagnosed with anxiety since i was 13. this past december, i got an email from a creative director at a nyc advertising agency out of the blue and he offered me an internship based on some of the art i posted online.i flew out there and finished the internship. i was scared shitless on the plane and leading up to the whole thing. but i did it. i fucking did it. i was in the busiest, loudest, most faced pased city in america. i had to ride the subway packed full of hundreds of people. i had to interact with producers and directors. i had deadlines.somehow, somewhere the courage to accomplish this task was deep inside of me. and i just want to say if i can do it, you can do it. it's possible. things do change. you are not forever trapped in your anxiety. my challenge for you today is to get out of your comfort zone. try something new. try something different. even if it's the smallest thing you can think of. try it. you will be suprised what the human brain is capable of.i hope i inspired at least one of you today. if it did, posting my story has been a success. good luck to you. you can do it.edit: thank you for all the kind words. was not expecting this response. it makes me want to continue doing what i'm doing. :) thank you!
anxiety is like the ink splatter in mario kart, it tries its hardest to blind me but i will always push through til it fades.
thank you for coming to my open mic night there's more hors d'oeuvres on the way out.
i just skipped an entire day of school because i didn't have homework for one class
why am i like this... i just don't wanna deal with the teacher probably yelling at me and the entire class making fun of me and i can't.. i don't know how to explain it
been suffering from quite extreme anxiety for couple years now and, well, my chinese new year fortune cookie was very insightful..

passed my driving test after 7 years
i am 23 years old, meaning that i have been putting off getting my drivers license for 7 years (since i was 16 obviously). because i’ve had horrible anxiety with everything in my life, and driving/performing in front of others being at the very top of my fears, i went and took my on the road test today and passed. i didn’t have to use any medication or deep breathing, i just knew how amazing it would feel once it was over. i’ve gotten my permit 3 times in the past but let them expire because of my fear of the actual driving test. trust me. if i can do it, you can do it 
i really wanted to go see alita this weekend but all my friends are out of town. i remembered someone in this sub posted about going to the movies alone even though that sounded terrifying. but i got up the courage and said fuck it and went out. i had a really good time. thanks mate.

saw this on facebook today and feel like everyone can relate. i wish i could explain just how this feels to think this way.

this goes for those of us with anxiety, too. be proud of those little victories!

does anyone else have a terrible memory due to anxiety or depression?

does anyone else get overwhelmed with sudden plans and shut down?
if i get invited to something day-of i’ve been freaking out recently. i’m not really sure if it’s depression or anxiety. but it’s like i really want to go but the possibilities overwhelm me. i have 100% of these times ended up at home alone and crying because i really don’t want to be. i don’t know if i should force myself to go or what. i usually end up frustrating (as far as my itchy mind can tell) my live-in boyfriend because i have to do mental gymnastics about it for a hour or two, make him late, then end up not going.  i don’t think he’s mad or cares but i feel bad about it still, help? edit: words
i temporarily deactivated my instagram, and it was one of the best things i’ve done for my anxiety/depression (:
i made a similar post regarding why social media can be toxic, etc....but i finally decided to choose my mental health over some bullshit “game of likes” which is instagram. gonna take a niiice, long break (might be one month, might be six, who knows...). i’m proud of my decision and would highly recommend the same to anyone who has been on the fence. trust, not having to subconsciously compare yourself daily to “perfect images” of “perfect people” will do wonders if you already struggle with anxiety or have self-image/confidence struggles.that is all. *side note: this song is a whole ass mood for me today since i did away with insta, maybe some of you can appreciate it too  “flume - never be like you (takaryu redo)” * (:
i feel actually really good today
i feel great today. i snapped back to reality and pretty much have no anxiety. i know this won’t last forever but i thought i’d share how great i feel. idk i feel proud of myself!
i need to go to the gym to help with my anxiety but i can’t go to the gym because of my anxiety.
edit: can i just say all of you are amazing and so incredibly supportive holy hell! you guys have given amazing suggestions and i’m happy to say i was given my correct meds today and will be hitting the gym tomorrow for my first day back! i’m nervous but you guys have been so encouraging i know i can do this. i wish i could hug all of you, and make all of you my gym buddies ♥️
i haven't had a panic attack in over a month!
that doesn't mean anxiety doesn't kick in every now and then, but i'm not letting it boil up enough to throw me off my center!!!edit: thanks so so much to everyone that's sending good vibes. you can do it too, *together* we can do it too
does anybody else feel anxious when you are not doing anything?
like, if you are working, then you have something to focus on, you didn’t feel anxious, and if you have a long holidays (like a week or so), and you have nothing else to do. you feel anxious for nothing. any tips on this? edit: thanks for all the comments, i’ve read all of them, feel so great that we are not alone here. :) 
i got the job!
i just got the email from mcdonalds and i'm so fucking happy! i can finally make my own money, and i plan to move out of my house eventually. after 2 years of depression, anxiety, and self doubt i'm finally moving forward in my life. i can almost cry honestly, i never thought i could beat my anxiety and depression. this is a new chapter of my life, and i'm positive it will only get better! much love everyone, and i hope you all succeed. <3
does anyone else have so much they have to do that they just end up doing nothing?
i'm under a lot of stress right now with going back to school, starting a new job and being a mom of 2 at the same time. i have to hire a sitter for my daughter, which means i have to post an ad and then actually *interview* people. in person. and then tell them if i want to pay them money to watch my kids. my house is also just disgusting. toys everywhere and laundry and dishes and just random shit. it's not like hoarders level and it's respectable enough but it needs a good deep cleaning. i have to work by myself for my first time ever tomorrow. customer service. i have to figure out school loans, find a way to buy these ridiculously expensive textbooks, buy supplies for school, clean my car out, go grocery shopping, sell stuff on ebay and donate the rest of it, and try to get 8 hours of sleep because with my anxiety i've been managing about 4 and that's not cutting it anymore. i feel like i'm constantly about 30 seconds away from a panic attack. if i think about how much i need to do i can feel myself start to hyperventilate and my chest seizes up and my whole body feels tense and i start clenching my teeth. so the only way i can stop it is to lay down, get out my tablet and play candy crush. i actually did that for two straight hours last night after the kids went to bed without even realizing it. anyway this is rambling and stuff i just needed to get it out. 
welcome to my virtual thanksgiving
to everyone who is hiding to avoid the people in your house, everyone who is trapped where they are, everyone who is alone, happy thanksgiving.it's okay to hide. it's okay to take care of yourself. you can still be a part of something. you can celebrate the way you want to. you can celebrate here, with me. where we can hide in our rooms and have our episodes and get through this day together.come and join me. i'll be here all day!edit: it's seven hours later but don't worry. my virtual door is still open. no one is late to my thanksgiving, we just move at our own pace! you are always welcome here!
does anyone get anxious about engaging with their old hobbies? i get so panicked and feel like a failure when i just want to chill and have fun.
i’ve been trying really hard recently to take up some of my old pastimes again. i used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. now i get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when i try to get back into them. i think its a confidence issue? like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. i went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. i was considered dumb because i didn’t get a* in everything and i really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. now i feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. they’re meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, i should be good at them and see progress in them. am i even the person i think i am now that i’m too anxious to do any of these things? another issue is feeling anxious that i’m possibly wasting time. i used to love sitting playing games for hours but now i feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. i feel like i should be doing something more proactive, even if i have nothing else i really need to be doing. i’ve started working with polymer clay because its something new and therapeutic and creative. i’ll hopefully see some progress and build up my confidence in myself, instead of feeling like i’ve lost the knack for things i used to enjoy. i just feel ridiculous when i take a step back and look at myself. i’m having heart palpitations just trying to relax and do something i used to enjoy. how many of you can relate? i feel like most people stop doing the things they love because of depression/a loss of motivation and interest. 
after seven years in college, i graduated yesterday!
it took longer than most but i did it! i remembered lurking on this subreddit a few months back and reading someone finishing their degree. i didn't think i'd make it this far, honestly. but that post gave me hope when i just wanted to runaway and hide from everyone.the past 10 months had some of my worst anxiety moments in my life. so if you are reading this, please believe in yourself! you can do it! and do not be afraid to open up to people who matter. believe in them believing in you.edit:hello! i just realized i basically ghosted everyone here. i came back to my hometown and was travelling.i'm really thankful for the support from everyone in this community. i posted here so i that i may pay it forward - the old post gave me the push i needed when times were dark. hopefully it can help anyone who is reading this also.being an irregular student does take a toll on you. thoughts about being delayed made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. oftentimes i felt alone and left out, group projects ended up being a solo thing for me and then i would think i wouldn't be able to finish it. when i enrolled on my last year, i had friends and relatives tell me they were excited that i was finally graduating. that expectation crippled me for a good portion of the year.it wasn't because my family and friends weren't supportive - they were, they cheered me on. it was i that held me back. and i am glad i overcame my anxiety.thank you to this subreddit. it really does help to lift each other up. may we always give each other the boost we need!
does anyone else get jealous of people that don’t deal with mental illness?
*edit: let me mention i know everyone deals with their own problems/mental illness. i specifically mean people that may not visibly deal with it like some of us do, or handle it better.[21f] diagnosed with gad, depression, addthis is an odd question that has plagued me off and on for a few years..... i am posting here since my anxiety has been my most dominant mental health issue in the last few years. also because i think this is actually a pretty big problem (for me at least). it only breeds more hate in my heart which i don’t need when i’m already juggling so many things. a lot of times i find myself so shaken when i see other people, especially people i might’ve gone to high school with for instance, doing so well mentally. they are able to handle so much more (perhaps they take more college classes, work more than me; etc) and still maintain a happy and overall positive attitude. meanwhile i struggle to get out of bed most mornings and am trying to keep up my motivation enough so i don’t drop out of school again.i hope this doesn’t come off as a “woe is me” post. i realize what my problems are and also realize i am the only one who can help them. i just want to start an open discussion to see if anyone else feels the same envy and jealously i feel sometimes when i see other people who are doing well in regards to their mental health, despite all the hardships in life.*also i might add i am very new to reddit. please feel free to give me any criticism if anything seems off in my post. i’m still getting used to this platform 
does anyone else not go on reddit after they post something because they're scared of what people will comment?
i do this a lot. whenever i post something on reddit i don't go on the site again for a while because i'm too scared to see what people commented on it. i'm super worried about what people will say about my post and i've deleted some of them because i was so apprehensive. i know i shouldn't be worried but i always end up worrying. 
does anyone else wonder how different their life would be if they didn't grow up with anxiety and depression?
i can't help but think of all the opportunities i have missed or passed on because of my anxiety. i know i would have a much better job. i've been offered promotions but passed them up because thinking of the responsibilities put me into a  panic attack. i've also missed out on so many travel opportunities because of my anxiety. i know i probably shouldn't think about what could have been but sometimes i can't help think about it.
is anyone else physically unable to relax the day of something scheduled?
for example: let's say i have this appointment next tuesday, at 4pm. up until that day, it's not too bad. i know it's not that day yet, so i'm able to relax a little bit. oh, i don't have to do that thing for a another few days, thank god but then slowly the day of starts rolling around. the day before i start getting this terrible grumpy attitude and mood, i start feeling depressed, my day is ruined because of this thing the next day.i start losing sleep, i toss and turn at night before this scheduled thing thinking and thinking about the worst thing ever happening tomorrow to me, when in actuality it never turns out to be that bad.then the day of this thing rolls around, i wake up in an absolute foul mood, i set off 3 hours earlier than i probably should have just because i can't bear the thought of sitting in the house when i have this thing coming up (i psychically cannot relax, my body won't allow me). i've tried staying at home knowing i have some appointment later in the day, and i honestly feel like i'm trapped in a jail cell.but then, after all of that, a huge sigh of relief just blows over me. this thing i've been worrying about wasn't even that bad, but the build-up is the real killer, the real anxiety builder and sometimes i honestly feel like i'm losing my sanity. i go from this grumpy, depressed guy to someone absolutely happy beyond belief at least for those few hours after getting something done.
too tired and anxious to leave my bed. angry and frustrated at myself for staying in bed. feeling guilty for not doing anything and wasting time. more anxiety. more paralysis and continue to be stuck in bed. frustrated i can’t just do the thing. repeat.
edit: update i was able to leave my bed briefly today, please see my comment below. to everyone else going through the same thing, i hear you friends, keep going.edit 2: someone rightly pointed out that they feel too anxious to read all the comments so i’ll write here how the rest of my day went:“thanks for the responses everyone. for those asking, i’m usually fairly good at dealing with this, i’m on medication, i’ve had therapy, i’m knowledgeable about mental health (i’m a social worker), i help my friends and clients through similar things. but despite all of this, sometimes it just gets me you know? i know logically it’ll pass, but it’s so hard, especially when you think ‘i thought i was done with this, not again!’. when you’re in it it’s so hard to think clearly and have perspective. it’s a hole i’ve fallen down many times before and always found my way out eventually, but it’s like each time i think ‘this is the one time i won’t beat it’.what i did that helped me out of bed today was decide i would do one small thing only. which was to walk 10 mins to the shop to buy oranges. it took me hours to make myself go, but i did, and i felt better for it. i was overwhelmed with all the things i should be doing and couldn’t start anything, but decided to be kind to myself and say that just doing that small thing was enough. i’m back at home and don’t want to go out again and will probably get into bed again and i still feel awful. but i have oranges now.from what i’ve read, it’s a positive feedback loop, doing one tiny thing gives you a dopamine boost, which is the motivation neurotransmitter, this then makes you feel more able to do another small thing, and so you build up and eventually hopefully can do more. but all at your own pace, with compassion for yourself when you need to take a break.
does anyone else's anxiety peak on sundays?
it's sunday and every sunday, i feel more anxious than other days. woke up with a panicky, nervous feeling this morning and can't shake it off. i worry too much about tomorrow and the next week for no good reason. i can't really enjoy sundays because of that.
i wish doing normal things was easy.
lately i can’t eat, sleep or even leave my house without worrying about every god damn thing. leave me alone, brain. 
sending you all a virtual hug.
if you’re reading this, i want you to take it easy on yourself; you’re doing the best you can. i made a post here recently and got some really nice replies that helped me a lot. i’m feeling a lot better now, so i thought i would send those good vibes back into the universe. :)
i am a first time homeowner. i am a medicated human with anxiety, whose mind runs a mile a minute. my s/o created this board method for me to “put my brain into buckets” during the day, so i can be at ease during work. it helps.

i'm going to look at my bank account balance and work on a budget tonight. i've been putting it off for months, but no matter how much it scares me, i'm going to do it.
checking my bank account balance gives me horrible, heart-pounding anxiety. i'm afraid i'll hate myself after seeing how much i've spent, and i also have some residual anxiety from when i was living paycheck-to-paycheck. however, i'm sick of feeling weighed down by money anxiety. the knowledge that i spend money impulsively, don't follow a budget, and don't check my bank account weighs on me \*heavily\*, and i'm ready to shed that weight. wish me luck.edit: i did it! i went through my expenses, cancelled 5 subscriptions (yes, 5), set up a monthly transfer so i can automatically build my savings account, and went through my mint account to see where i'm spending my money. my goal for january is to cut back on food spending.thank you so much for your encouragement! i still have more to do, but i made some great progress tonight. :d
is anyone else bothered by the gaps in the bathroom stalls?
it honestly drives me so insane.. there was a line in the bathroom and instead of waiting near the entrance like a normal human being she stands right in front of the stall i’m in and even inches closer to look through. wtf lady!? 
the brain doesn't care about being perfect - the psychology of perfectionism makes you feel meaningless, leading to self-doubt, perceived failure, and lack of confidence. the solution, research says, is to apply top-down frame shifts.

i tackled my greatest fear and accepted a job!
i have had 5 jobs in the last 4 years. i quit every single one of them, usually within a week of commencing. the longest i’ve stayed in a job has been 6 weeks. employment has been my biggest hurdle in my adult life. i become so anxious at work, i start to panic and lose the ability to concentrate. my body goes into fight or flight and i just simply run away and don’t look back. then the guilt, and depression hits me hard. after a good two years of no employment and being on horrible government benefits that constantly threatened to cut and suspended my payments due to not being seen as disabled enough to not work due to my mental health.... i’ve finally had enough. i took my own steps, i went out of my way and i applied for a job in a hospital. i got an interview and have been accepted and started just today! i have a week of training and then it’s all me looking after a ward. i’ll be doing the afternoon/night shift 3 days a week as an administrator maintaining paper work and discharging/admitting patients. my employer is well aware of my hurdles with my mental health and said she is very supportive so fingers crossed i can keep at this and build my confidence up! i know i will have my ups and downs, the anxiety will hit me hard some days more than others but i just have to remember how good working is for my mind and how we all start somewhere.i am proud of myself, it’s so good to be able to say that for the first time in a long time. thank you everyone on this subreddit for being so supportive. i hope to read lots of progress stories on here :)
we are all chris traeger (xpost /r/pandr

i'm ashamed to say i did let out a bit of a giggle when i saw this.

i have gad and i do standup. thought y'all might appreciate.

does anyone feel anxious about an hour or so before work and then when you begin, your fine?
it’s happening to me right now. i work at target as a seasonal guest advocate and it’s my 4th time working.edit: wow time went by fast when i was working at the register. i feel better now lol. i’m on break.
i did it, r/anxiety! i went to the movie theater by myself!
i have been wanting to see the secret life of pets ever since i saw the first trailer, but i couldn't find anybody who wanted to go with me. after a week of mustering up the courage to go by myself, i finally drove to the theater tonight. my hands were shaking as i used the touchscreen to buy my ticket from the automated ticket dispenser, but after a deep breath, i managed to click confirm. i actually came at a pretty bad time, because the theater was absolutely packed with kids and parents. as a 22 year old male, i stuck out like a sore thumb. thankfully, the lights were low when i walked in, so nobody even gave me a second glance. get this! since most of the seats were taken, i had to take a seat at the very front! i was extremely self conscious for the first 5 minutes, as i imagined everyone staring at the weirdo without kids who came by himself. as the first trailers started to play, i calmed down a lot, and from then on, it was easy to relax and enjoy the movie. i even laughed along with the rest of the audience during the movie's funny moments.i am so proud of myself today. i didn't get any rude or mean comments from anybody, and i saw a movie that i've been wanting to see for awhile. this day was completely awesome :)
i just paid a girl a compliment.
so i was just leaving university campus when an attractive lady caught my eye, i thought she had nice fashion sense. so i’m walking past her, my mind is racing, i’m thinking, should i? only if she looks up and makes eye contact. and remember, this is all in like two seconds. and it’s moderately crowded with people walking back and forth. so she looks up, we make eye contact, we smile at each other and i tell her i like her dress, still smiling she thanked me... and that was that.one of my big things is social cues and mispronouncing words so this was a really big deal to me. and it feels good to receive compliments right? so yeah... it was a massive endorphin rush and confidence booster.edit: thanks for the support everyone!
i'm so anxious that my fitbit thinks i'm excercising.
seriously, a panic attack counts as cardio. i want to rage quit life today.
ate for the first time day at the psych hospital dining hall
i know this is a small thing but it’s such a big deal to me that i’ve created a reddit account instead of lurking. i’m back in the psych ward for the 4th time in 2 years for gad/agoraphobia and i’ve been in here for 2 months this week. i’m not skinny thanks to my boy olanzapine and when i came in i weighed 116.6 kilos (~255 pounds). my anxiety has prohibited me from going to the dining room and i currently weigh 97.6 kilos (~217 pounds). meaning i’ve lost 19 kilosthat was until today of course when the doctors words of encouragements led me into the dining room and i actually sat down and ate. yes i sat down alone and didn’t say a word but i actually went in with all those people and ate. i know this is a small and dumb thing but it’s a big sign of progress for me. just had to get it off my chest. progress takes time and at the start it’s hard to see the finishing line but it’s there. you just have to believe in it!
happy valentine’s day. all of you are loved!
usually this day makes me super anxious and i avoid all social media because i started to realize i was getting upset over people being happy. i started to wane myself off of facebook because it made my hands shaky and clammy. i was triggering myself by looking at old flames, exes dating new people, etc. i’ve come a long way from last year for sure. make sure to love yourself today! do something nice for yourself and know we are all supportive of each other 
does posting on reddit give anyone else anxiety sometimes?
i feel like i have a lot i want to say but sometimes i'm afraid to post anything because i'm worried about criticism or mean comments lol.
i just ordered a pizza.
by myself. on the phone. without stuttering (much). for the first time ever.i feel fucking invincible.
does anyone else prefer single player games over online multiplayer games?
single player games seem peaceful and relaxing, like everything is going well and you're actually fun. online multiplayer seems so stressful, frightening, and it really makes you think a lot of negative things.it feels discouraging that some people i know think it's weird for me to play only single player games.edit: i didn't expect this post to get so many responses. it really helps to know that there were so many different answers and seeing different perspectives on this. thanks :d
reminder of a few important unnoticed characteristics of anxiety you might have missed
- it urges you to find a solution asap, there is an element of hurry and unnecessary haste.- it urges you to find the perfect solution right away and rejects everything but the perfect solution- it plays with your memory and conveniently distorts successful events into memories of failure because of catastrophising- because anxiety is often accompanied by depression, memory is foggy and because your animal mind realises that your memory is unreliable it adds more and more fear-based shortcuts to prevent you from forgetting the right response to several common daily situations. this obviously makes your life entirely poisoned and anxiety driven.the software engineering equivalent would be using only exception handling and error handling to handle conditional statements like 'if' and 'switch/case'.you can come to rely on an elaborate system of pain-trigger-responses (exception handlers) rather than normal behaviour (if/switch) and live in misery and still be highly functioning. this is typically with people who have anxiety for many years or decades.so if you have a temporary or recurring memory dysfunction (depression, neurological injury, nerve damage, brain injury, migraines, constant headaches), normal visualisation may become difficult and in order to function and not go blank and forget things all the time, you might start using your limbic system to make memory shortcuts instead of your brain. this causes constant anxiety.- you could use the name  fight/flight/freeze response or exaggerated limbic system response instead of the name anxietythe name anxiety makes it sound like it is a mysterious human disorder, whereas it is clearly about the stupid animal mind inside us, and it pushes the blame correctly on the limbic system, taking away the mystery and unknown aspect of it, **thus making it much more benign and robbing it of its primary weapon - fearsomeness**
i just unfollowed my ex on all social media
checking social media the past couple months has caused me so so much anxiety, i was constantly afraid to see his face pop up on my screen, because i guess it was my last tie to him. last night i finally unfollowed him! i’m proud of myself but still sort of sadedit: thank you guys so much!!! the supportive comments have really brought peace of mind to me and honestly after the initial anxiety, i feel a sense a freedom
does anyone else fear that people you interact with might think you're insane because of how weird anxiety makes you act?
sometimes i'm totally fine and can hangout with complete strangers and have a great time and all is well but other times (probably the majority of the time) i'm a nervous wreck and my voice cracks or gets way lower than usual and i mumble and can't look people in the eyes and (apparently, from what i've been told) have a super pissed off look on my face for no reason when i'm interacting with people i don't know and i'm starting to get scared that a lot of people think i'm some kind of psycho from how weird i may seem when my anxiety's flaring up.i also start over analyzing the way i walk so i walk super weird and sometimes have intrusive thoughts of super embarrassing moments that make me visibly cringe.... jesus, even as i'm typing this i'm realizing i probably look even worse than i thought.... anyone else fear that those around them think they're some kind of psycho when they're actually just super nervous for no reason?
my wedding is tomorrow, i’m gonna make it
i never believed i would make it. i thought i’d have a heart attack from panicking too much sometimes. i’m trying to not panic now. she is so beautiful. she’s the one that can calm me completely. life gets better. never give up
i just need to say it.
even though it might not look like much, i promise i am trying my absolute hardest. 
i finally ordered for myself at a starbucks!
so whenever i go out, i’m always with a friend. that's because i have so much trouble talking to people and doing simple things like ordering a drink that they have to do it for me. today, however, i decided to do it myself and here’s how it went. ((m=me e=employee))m: hi can i have a hot chocolate, please? (now i’m thinking, ’crap i forgot to say the size’ so i'm starting to panic, but obviously, the conversation continued)e: ok, what size would you like?m: uh... um... (my friend is holding my hand at this point as i was starting to struggle a bit)m: a small, pleasee: whipped cream?m: yes, pleasee: that will be (insert price)then i started fumbling with my money. i had thought it was £3.10 so i had it ready in my hand, but it wasn't. i had to recount my coins and my friend is reassuring me. i handed her the money and walked away, taking a step back and celebrating silently. my friend gave me a hug and i walked away with my drink, feeling like a boss. i know this isn't much, but it meant a lot to me as it was my first time in years that i managed to do it all by myself and i didn't have a panic attack after (:
it's ok to be nervous. it's ok to be scared. it's ok to cry.
i don't know who needs to hear this, but this is recent advice that has helped me a bit with my anxiety. i was reminded of this before a recent first date. i was pacing back and forth, getting more and more nervous. my roommate said it's a first date, of course you're nervous. i stopped pacing. wait, that actually makes sense, it's completely normal to be nervous before a first date. in fact, i would say not being nervous is actually weird. i'm being normal and i need to stop reacting to my anxiety like it's not normal. i need to stop fighting it.it's very easy to get stuck in the mindset of if i'm not completely comfortable, then that is bad. - but it's important to remember that there is a lot of distance between comfort and uncontrollable anxiety. a lot of the people here have been on the extreme end of anxiety, it sucks, and it's something we'll have to continue to battle. but we should also realize that the early stages of anxiety are sometimes very normal, felt by most people. if we begin to think it's not normal, then that just helps it feed it, it spirals, it grows, and then it does become abnormal.anyways, random perspective that may help someone.
im sick and tired of coming home from school where i rarely speak to anyone and just spending the rest of the day in my house but the thought of going outside, making friends and hanging out with them is too overwhelming for me

does anyone else feel so overwhelmed all the time?
i constantly feel overwhelmed by everything in life even on days where i’m not feeling stressed. its like i just get so anxious about every little thing and it builds up until it’s all too much.
can someone give me positive vibes for my midterms tomorrow?
feeling pretty anxious about my exams tomorrow. i've prepared enough and now just need to have that positive mentality while taking the test.&#x200b;edit: oh my gosh! thank you everyone for all of the positiveness! you've all been an amazing help. thank you!! :)update: i just finished my midterms, and i felt super confident about how they turned out! your help worked, and my nerves weren't as bad as they usually are. thank you everyone! know that you are all loved! <3
if someone tells me to just calm down one more time i swear to god .
anyone else have this problem people just say just calm down  or  i have anxiety too it's not that hard     like bitch if you had anxiety you would know you dont just calm down .  i'm cross posting this to the other anxiety sub too   
remember: you are strong.
i know there are times, especially on bad days, where you can feel so weak and helpless. so pathetic for not being able to beat back your anxiety, so useless for letting it win over you. always remember that that's not true. that's a lie the disorder is telling you, it's actually the opposite of true.you are so strong. you shoulder so much more every day than you should ever have to, and you still go on. you are always fighting. you've lived this long without giving up. you are brave for going about your day when all you want to do is crumple to the ground. you are a warrior for smiling when you want to cry. you are a champion for getting up when you just want to stay in bed all day.i know some people might be tired of hearing things like this, but i also know there has to be at least one person who needed this reminder today. i know i needed to remind myself. you deserve a medal for the fight you're fighting. you are not weak. you are not pathetic. you are brave. you are strong.
does anyone else miss their old selves? before anxiety and depression messed you up?
because i do. i miss those days when i used to smile a lot, laughed a lot, and talk a lot. i keep avoiding my past friends now because i'm such a mess. as i was studying at school, all i can do now is to watch my old friends grow up with me at the background. they just grow up so fast.

cat
i just had a massive anxiety attack like the worst i’ve ever had and so i just hugged my cat and it took about half an hour but i’ve calmed down now and it’s all because of him i love him so much
be quiet i'm tired of your anxiety - my husband
yeah man, me too. shout out to anyone dealing with a significant other who says this kind of shit. 
currently experiencing my anxiety nightmare. reported sexual harassment at work and have a meeting with hr and the ceo in an hour. willing myself not to puke.
long story, but over a couple months, one of my bosses had been sexually harassing me. i kept trying to brush it off, but i didn't know how to stop it and it was making me extremely uncomfortable being around him. i had worked for this person for two years without incident, and he knows about my anxiety, need to please others, and my conflict avoidance. literally one of my weaknesses in my performance evaluation is trouble saying no to people. i am also half his age and he is many levels above me in the company. i was the perfect target. i finally confided in my supervisor, who gave me the courage to step forward. i wrote out a log of days and times and what occured, which was a good idea timeline-wise, but also kept me from having to repeat out loud what was said and done to me when i went to hr. hr was very professional and took it seriously, telling me it wasn't my fault and they were glad i came forward.my harasser is on unpaid suspension while they conduct an investigation, interviewing others in his department to see if anyone else has observed anything else. i have a meeting with hr, the ceo, and the vp in an hour and i can't stop panicking. i don't know what they will ask me. and i am completely mortified that they all know what i let happen. i also feel intense guilt for ruining his career. he was the face to many of our projects, and i'm throwing such a wrench into it. i really trusted him, so when this all started, i had no idea what to do. i've been crying for days. sweating constantly. i just want this over with and this has been the longest day of my life. i can't focus on work at all and just want to go home and hide.
i have no title for this. i'm scared. i made this.

i’ve deleted my last two posts on here because my anxiety tells me everyone will think it’s dumb and stupid. anyone else?

i didnt had anxiety today and im the happiest man on earth

it’s my birthday! i confidently talked with many people today despite my social anxiety! hooray!
edit: woah! you guys are seriously incredible and so kind! thank you for all the love and messages! today was progress, tomorrow will be more. 
after 5 years of anxiety depression and daily panic attacks i’ve decided enough is enough!
i’m currently on my way to a new start, a new job fuck this anxiety it will be here regardless so i might aswell go and live my life as i want to! no longer will i let it control every aspect of my life, and for the first time in about 7 years i have just got a solid 8 hour unbroken sleep, just thought i would share this with you guys, take care everyone.
my anxiety comes in waves of good weeks and bad weeks. i keep a diary and on a good week i wrote out a list of bullet points for me to read when i'm having a bad week
this is just something i wrote for myself and i was just wondering if it might help any of you even a bit, idk... it's not anything official so please don't get really angry at me if i have made a mistake.-	panic attacks / anxiety means cortisol levels are high-	it's next to impossible to think happy thoughts when there’s cortisol everywhere-	it's just the chemical making you feel this way, this is not you-	if you start feeling anxious, just try to lower the cortisol levels; breath, ground yourself, feet on the floor, mindfulness-	these are just thoughts, they aren’t as bad as they seem – it doesn’t seem true right now but you must believe it-	be aware and let them happen, don’t fight it-	you can get through this, you have before-	just ride it out-	resist the temptation to let the anxiety take over – you do not want to feel this way-	if you just want an excuse to relax/procrastinate you can do that without anxiety-	if you refuse to believe that when you’re happy you’re not just faking it, then at least accept that it's nicer like that anyway as you dont have frequent panic attacks-	fuck the cortisol-	fuck anxiety-	this won’t last foreveredit: thank you for all the lovely comments
#metoo
i am having a very hard time this week with my anxiety because i feel inundated by the news related to kavanaugh/ford allegations. in may of 1986, i, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that i knew, while i was intoxicated.  i am not going to share the details of the attack,  i am willing to say that i was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and i was unable to attend  my high school graduation because i was in the hospital.  although i am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren’t from “falling down in the woods” and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that i didn’t just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.i never talked about it. i never wanted to. i never wanted “justice.”  i wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time i felt like it was my fault. after 32 years.. it’s right there.. all over again.i want to scream at every facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about ford not coming forward.  i want to punch everyone who says “well, she was drunk” or “boys will be boys.”  i want to vomit every time someone says “why did she wait so long?” and worse.. “he didn’t do anything..he just didn’t help her.” i feel like this happened to me last week, not over 30 years ago.  it doesn’t seem fair after successfully tucking it away for so long  it has resurfaced. i can see their faces in my dreams again. even the ones who laughed at my torn bloody clothing and didn’t to anything to help, edit: i adore all of you!! i focused on all of your support and wonderful well wishes.. not on the news!! thank you, thank you, thank you! 
pokémon go is helping people deal with social anxiety and depression in the most amazing ways

calling in sick gives me massive amounts of anxiety
i started a new job at the beginning of may, and everything has been going well i think. last night i started feeling bad (i.e. swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, weak body with chills and hot flashes). i went to bed early and took some medicine and vitamin c, dreading the morning and the fact that i may possibly have to call out. well, i woke up about 45 minutes ago and still felt horrible. but i still got up, showered, shaved, and got dressed, until i finally told myself “wow i can’t do this.” i stared at boss’s phone number on my phone for a good 5 minutes before i worked up the courage to finally call him. he seemed like it was fine and told me to get better,  but my anxiety is still eating at me. dae get anxiety from calling in sick? especially since i’m new at my position, i feel like i am slacking off and my boss maybe thinks i’m lying. i also get paid hourly, so the 8 hours of work i’m missing is going to mess up my budget for the month:-(
i finally made a doctors appointment on my own!
i have general anxiety and social and really hate making phone calls as most people with anxiety do but today i finally made a appointment on my own .my husband usually calls stuff for me but i'm tired of letting this control me. i've been having some health issues and keep putting off going but i know i need to go.i was so nervous to call at first but then i realized theres no reason its not like she was judging me and even if she is who cares.i was so proud of myself all day for something normal adults do all the time lol. my appointment isn't for 3 weeks which sucks and now i'm a little nervous for that but i know i can get through it. we always make things out to be worst than they end up being, its so weird.&#x200b;&#x200b;wow i didn't expect so much positive comments! thanks guys so much.this really made my day. 
i'm convinced if i don't worry then the bad things will happen and worrying keeps it from happening.
title. i often feel like if i'm not constantly on edge, or in fight or flight more and let my guard down and think everything will be okay, it won't be. often when i believe everything ever was okay, it wasn't.like i tried practising being more loving in my marriage, and just trusting him despite my paranoia. he was cheating on me.i thought my parents were going to change, they didn't.if i went out when there's a snow storm warning, if i went out then the storm will happen. if i stay home, it'll be a false alarm and instead i look paranoid.
saw someone else post this recently but i got a job ☺️ i’m so happy. i just listened to everything my gf said and slowly figured everything out. she is a blessing. you can do it!!!!!!
all i did was make a profile on the indeed app(yea i sound like a shill but fr) and applied to 7 jobs in seconds this morning. this afternoon got a call from one of them and went in for an interview.  i decided to just be myself and not worry about the interview, to treat them like a friend. they have something to gain from me and i have something to gain from them? thats how i went into it and it worked ☺️ i’m so proud.  omg.  sorry.  i know i’m not special. but i had such a massive panic attack last night i thought i would never pull out of it. today is so different ☺️edit: someone upvote this once so it can be at 420 pls? https://imgur.com/a/mcn1z7y ahhhh.  i love each and every one of you...
i have a job interview for a promotion today!
send good vibes my way please! ☺️update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! i walked in feeling super confident, but.... i did not get the job. it turns out that i was vastly unprepared for the interview and i had no idea. the interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed i figured i already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. i had asked a senior employee who has had the position i was interviewing for what i needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. i know he didn’t do it maliciously, he’s a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. the interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time i apply for a promotion. i was terrified that  i would make a catastrophic mistake during my interview and i did. while being so worried about my future with the company and being black listed if i messed up i had forgotten that the interviewers and managers are good and honest people who want to help their employees grow and succeed. even if we do fail, sometimes there’s a hand ready to help us back up. 
hello everyone, just wanted to let you know if you ever need someone to talk to, you can always pm me. i'm here for you, you aren't alone. i've been going through a bit of a rough patch with my anxiety so maybe we can help each other! love you guys!

how are you doing today?

oh i didn't realize i could just relax

i felt apart in front of her
we had such a great time in bed, just hanging around laughing and watching a movie. in one moment i just felt apart for no reason, i crashed, i felt so broken and started crying while hugging. i asked her if she could just hold me tight, as tight as she can and she did that. she said i love you.&#x200b;for the first time in my life i felt safe while having a breakdown, all i did earlier was just getting shit for being such a crybaby. &#x200b;i've never felt that much support and we've been together only for about 3 weeks, but when i'm with her i feel safe mentally, i feel like pieces of me are coming back together.&#x200b;thank u for listening
last night i went to a club alone (and loved it). a few years ago i could barely leave the house.
saw online that an artist i listen to was gonna be djing at a club near me. the music is quite underground (techno/lofi house) and none of my friends are really into it. on a whim i thought 'fuck it' and bought a ticket.went to it last night. music was blaring, place was busy af. there are i am, dancing and just feeling the music, not caring about what anybody thinks. while i was there it dawned on me that a few years ago i could barely leave the house without being ridden with anxiety/panic.i hope this post gives some people hope :)also i'm just really happy to be where i am today, looking back on how i used to be.
does anyone else get random lapses of “contentment” where your mind is at peace before the anxiety comes back?
edit: wow. thank you all for the replies and letting me know i’m not alone. you are all very brave every day. 
drinks alcohol to relieve anxiety. wakes up with anxiety from drinking alcohol 

for the first time ever, i ran with my shirt off!
i'm not even lean, plus i'm as pale as a vampire. woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!
this made me smile

does anyone here think sometimes that everyone secretly hates them but is only acting nice to them to not be rude?

i got over 50 downvotes on a comment i left as a joke, and cried because i thought i hurt people's feelings
someone left a comment that was a pun, and i joked about downvoting them because of it, but i actually upvoted instead, then commented that i upvoted it. i checked reddit just now and saw that it had over 50 downvotes. i feel absolutely terrible. the comment i'm talking about: i almost had to downvote your comment because of the pun. take my upvote, you hilarious bastard.
anyone have to pee a lot when they get anxious?
i think it's 100% anxiety related as when i am not in my head and stuff i don't have to pee a lot. but when i do get anxious it just doesn't stop it's like every 5 minutes and its like how can there still be fluid left in me at this point. &#x200b;wondering if anyone else has dealt with similar issues and if you have been able to solve it some way
fiancée has anxiety during long car rides. how to have a not anxious fiancée. a 6 step process
step 1: turn the air-con to minimum temp, which is 50 for us. turn on recirculation to cool it faster. step 2: load tank top and shorts wearing fiancée into back seat. buckle aforementioned fiancée in. wait for hypothermia to start to set in (just kidding, just enough to be a lil cold) step 3: lean seat back, put blankets over fiancée. step 4: adjust neck pillow on fiancées neck,  give ipod (which is plugged into car) and put on spotify. place earbuds in her ears, adjust volume to a comfortable level. step 5: drive for comfort, expect her to fall asleep as soon as we get on the highway. bring air up to 68f and turn off recirculation. step 6: awake fiancée on arrival to destination. 
sometimes i wish i had a friend like this.

i wrote a bit of a poem about self-doubt. my therapist advised that i share it.
i'm scared! i shout, to no onei'm hurting but what if it isn't real? there is a duality to the doubt i feel, outward initially, then turned inside - did this even happen? do i see this right? can i trust my mind?is my memory real or is it definedby my own narrative?of course it is.then how do i believe it? how do i know it's true?if this is just in my head then what do i do?am i everything i hate, defined? as bad as those i strike down in my mind? the jury is out and it seems almost unanimous, but what if the crime was committed by one of us? the judge is scornful and asks with derision, are you even capable to make this decision?after all, you wrote your own dialogue. internal monologue, set thrusters to overdrive. constantly in fight or flight, zoom in, analyse. please give me some peace. peace comes to the dead.i don't want to be die,but perhaps it might be nice to have a rest.why can i see so many things?not a hallucination, that's not what this is.it's a sight i can't see with my eyes.the connections, the links, the things that make my heart stop.they're not visual but they exist.they exist in my mind, and my mind alone.i state them aloud and in pours the doubt. i made this.i have created something, what is it?oh, it's anxiety. hello. sit with me a while. am i propogating my own downfall?this person is hurting me, let me tell you.this is all the things that they do;it doesn't sound bad enough. it sounds petty, pathetic, petulent and pitiful, not like it should cause the pain that i go through. yes, i'm being negatively affected by external factors,but i'm the one processing them.am i doing this right?is this okay?am i validated for feeling this way?did i put myself in the wrong situations,or have i convinced myself they're bad?would things be fine if i saw this differently?paint on a smile, adopt positivity, or is that accepting less than i deserve?what do i deserve anyway?decency. respect. honesty.love, maybe.but why? do i give these to others?can i?the main point of contention -is everything i know just an invention?we're judged on our action and not our intention.i'll never see how another sees me, so how will i ever truly rest easy. would people be honest? am i?you get back what you put into the world.did i put this out? is this projection?is this a narrative for my own protection?i don't feel very safe.have i made myself a victim?or did other people harm me?did they shatter the glass, or did i?pandora had hope in her box of demons.i wonder if doubt always sat on it's shoulder, nesting, infecting, and spilling all over? will things get better, is this just situational?are they too broken or too confrontational? or maybe, just maybe, it's me.i'm always the common denominator, see. am i putting myself in punishing places?seeing the lies behind smiling faces? or have i just framed it that way? everything bad happens to me.does it really?i'm resilient. i get through.look at everything i've had to do.i'll tell you, but it's from my point of view.so how do we know even know if its true?what would you say? and would i believe you? where do i go when i can't accept my own truth, but can't accept another either?i view everything i perceive through a fear beingdeceived. can any of us be believed? i don't trust because i don't want to be wrong.but then i can't trust myself. what if i'm the one with the big bag of tricks?pull the wool over my own eyes.fill my mind with my own-brand lies.is there respite? is there relief? whats the cure? is it self belief? how do i believe what i know can't be fact? how is everyone else maintaining that act? am i alone?i feel alone, i whisper, to no one.[edit: thank you for comments. it's good to hear this made you feel seen. and thank you to the anonymous gold and platinum givers  so much appreciation for you all. we're not as alone as we feel, it seems.]
does anyone else not consider sunday a day off since you spend it in a constant state of panic thinking about the next day and week?
it's nauseating and exhausting. i can't eat or concentrate. i feel sick. cold sweats and panic attacks. i hate the anticipation. it only fuels my anxiety and panic. how do you cope with sunday anxiety?
if you're about to get your day / morning started remember this:
you're not going to master the rest of your life in one day.  just relax.&#x200b;master the day. then just keep doing that everyday.&#x200b;edits: thanks for the silver award!
after social interactions, namely at work, i get a lot of anxiety thinking about what i said and people’s reaction to it. keeps me up at night (like now it’s 3am). specifically i think about how stupid a comment i made was, how desperate i must have seemed,and other negative things. why is this??

deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. no one has even noticed!
last saturday morning, i deactivated fb (with a view to letting it delete after however long it takes). i found that despite 400+ 'friends', i actually wasn't enjoying it at all anymore. i know it's a cliché, and not real at all, but seeing people live their seemingly perfect lives, going out together, watching the little cliques develop and feeling increasingly left out, i decided enough was enough. it's not helping my mental health in the slightest. it has to go.it is, admittedly, somewhat cathartic and liberating to no longer be a part of that social media network. i still have the ability to use messenger, so can still talk to people. but i think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed i'm no longer active on there. which i suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.i feel very lonely. friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if i message them, it just gets left on 'read'. there are only so many times i can try, before i stop because clearly they won't respond.there were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. about how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. the irony is, no one has. and despite not wanting to believe it, i don't think anyone will.i work, i go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. i'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.i've posted on here once or twice, yo other subreddits, but never to this depth of revealing my feelings. i honestly don't mind if no one resounds, it's just useful for me to get this out of me.i hate feeling sorry for myself, and i hate burdening people, even strangers - so anyone that reads this! with my ridiculous insignificant problems.i'm just so very lonely. i'm sorry. 
what people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.
when i am feeling anxious and am searching the internet for advice i often come across some form of this:understand that your anxiety is illogical and that you aren't actually in dangersuggesting that if you realize this, the anxiety will go away. in my experience it is the exact opposite. just feeling anxious is one thing. i've felt anxious before big events, it's not pleasant, but if i don't fight it, it comes and goes and i move on. but feeling anxious and knowing you shouldn't be is where the problems really start. when i am anxious and know i shouldn't be, i worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. i can stay like this for weeks or months and i only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and i get distracted enough to stop rejecting how i am feeling.in the last year i have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. this is way harder than it sounds. it's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. when i start feeling anxious, i make the conscious effort to accept how i'm feeling. i can't pull it off all the time, but i'm getting better and better at it. the trick is that you have to really believe it. you have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. you can't trick yourself and accept your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. you have to really be ok with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. it will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.edit: talking with several other anxiety sufferers, i'm finding that this advice is more applicable to people who experience chronic low-level anxiety and less applicable to people who experience acute panic attacks.
i got drunk for the first time in over 6 years this weekend. my anxiety is now so bad, that i am considering suicide.
i haven't drank in many years. this weekend i got drunk. i don't know why i allowed myself to drink, i guess i am not as strong as i thought, and now my anxiety is out of control. it has been almost two days since i drank, but my anxiety is still so bad that i feel that i would rather die than experience one more day feeling this badly. i have attempted suicide twice in the past, the last time being 5 years ago. i really don't want to die, but can no longer live with near constant and debilitating anxiety. has anyone ever experienced these feelings after using alcohol? thanks for reading.edit: i don't think it is right to downvote posts about suicide. can someone please tell me what i said in my post that was wrong? i am really sorry if i should not post here.
headed into a store to grab a game that wasn't on amazon. the workers were too friendly and kinda freaked me out a bit, i was nervous the whole time, but i made it in and out. woot.

dae ever feel like you are rushing through the day to get home to do nothing?
i feel like from the moment i wake up until i get home i am rushing through the day and my tasks. it ends up causing me to have more anxiety because i become forgetfull or i half-ass my work duties and end up regretting it. i know if i take a deep breath and just slow down things are much more stress free, but i really want to get to the point where that is my normal. i have a job, i'm done with college, what am i rushing for...? end rant.
i looked after myself today
i got up and had a shower and shaved and brushed my teeth. i've been doing everything i need to do for my children and around the house, but i've been neglecting myself. i also did my makeup and hair for work. i'm pretty proud of myself
i just talked myself down from an anxiety attack!
(context:my therapist and i have been working on getting to the root of my anxiety, and a lot of it comes from feeling like my needs are less valid than others, and villainizing myself for putting my needs first ever. )my boyfriends mom wanted to come over and help with yard work today, and it being my only day off for the next four days, didn’t really want to spend most of the day interacting with people and doing yard work. i started to go into a panic attack about it, then stopped myself and reminded myself that it’s ok to put my needs first. talked to myself gently instead of harshly and it really made a difference. still a bit anxious, but i have a game plan for the day and am planning on helping out with the basic yard work then excusing myself to have some alone time with my art or a video game. progress is good.
i'd like to share with you a picture that helps my confidence.

i am just average and adequate and that's ok!!
i'm not amazing at my job. i'm not the perfect employee. in most aspects i'm average. i'm okay. i can get things done to the expected level. and that's great! because nobody expects me to be 100% perfect. by being totally average i am better than half of everyone! isn't that kinda reassuring? i can do average. i can do just ok! that's a bar that i can aim for and hit, or overshoot, every time! i got this!edit: i didn't think i'd be that guy but i'm really happy that something i said resonated with someone! thanks for the gold!
my anxiety hurts
does anyone ever feel like that? like just in general, the tension and the tightness in my chest and scattered thoughts and the restlessness... so uncomfortable
increased anxiety/ruminating thoughts when your life isn't as busy?
does anyone else have increased anxiety, especially ruminating thoughts, when you're not busy with life and have too much time on your hands? how do you deal with this? i've been seeing a therapist lately and through our discussions about my anxiety she has pointed out that it seems like my anxiety is at its worst when i'm not busy at work, not busy dating people or seeing friends, no extracurricular activities etc.i used to love the idea of staying home and relaxing but not anymore.
i wish i could give my anxiety a body so i can beat its ass.

neuroscience study finds that being sleep deprived alters neural pathways that lead to increased fear acquisition mechanisms. how a lack of sleep fuels anxiety related symptoms.

does anyone else wake up with a sense of impending doom upon you?
it seems like every time i wake up in the morning i momentarily feel like i’m dying or spiraling out of control. i have almost a mini panic attack every time i wake up and then i have to ground myself and remind myself that i’m just waking up and everything is okay - does this happen to anyone else? it’s been very hard to deal with and almost makes me not want to go to bed at night because i know this will happen in the morning when i wake up. edit: woah. i did not expect to see this post get so many comments and upvotes - although it’s really heartbreaking to know all of you are experiencing this too i feel better knowing i’m not alone in this....this community has helped me a lot even though i’ve just been lurking for a while - i just wanna say thank you all. thanks for your comments and tips and i hope we can all get through this together, i wish all of you true peace and happiness ❤️
ever since i got blue hair i've realised people weren't looking at me before. they are now, and hopefully if i go back to my natural colour i'll be able to remember the difference
before, i always thought people were looking at me and judging me. they weren't, and i can tell now, because i now know how it feels for people to actually be looking at me aha.
anyone else waking up with anxiety?
the second i open my eyes, i wake up with intense anxiety and its hard for me to breath, anyone else have this too and does anyone know what it is?
i started writing poetry about my anxiety as a form of coping

my therapist of 4 years just passed away... i want to celebrate him. he helped me through my worst years.
this isn't a post about being anxious due to my clinical psychologist dying. it is a celebration of what he meant to me and a celebration of all the therapist out there that are making a difference. my therapist's name was louis. when i met him, nearly 4 years ago, i was at a bad place in my life. i had been suffering from the effects of anxiety disorder for nearly 13 years, and visiting my gp monthly for over a year, when i asked her for a recommendation for a therapist. she gave me louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.after delaying for weeks, i called all of the referrals i was given. two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was louis. what are the chances that i would like the only therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)i was really nervous about meeting louis because i had never been to therapy before. i had no idea what to expect. would he judge me? would he yell at me? would he humiliate me? would he intimidate me into taking action? i wasn't sure, but decided that i was willing to try.louis was a short jewish man that reminded me of the actor saul rubinek (warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. he had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. after meeting him once, i knew that we were going to get along. sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. this is how it was with louis and me. :)as i went to each session, i discovered that louis and i had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. so his recommendations felt tailored to me. in a way, talking to louis was like talking to an older version of myself. we had different upbringings, i was raised catholic and he was raised jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. this was the reinforcement i needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. i was in good hands.don't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. but every session was productive. he knew how to see past my bs. he knew how to get to the core of the issue. and the amazing thing was that the days that i thought i had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.basically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your bs. this means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. now, after 4 years of treatment. i am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to louis. my goal when i started therapy was as follows:to be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. louis helped me to do these things by supporting the work i did as a vlogger. he helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. he helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.now...today, while on a hike, i found out that louis had passed away via the internet. i hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. his message had been replaced with a referral service. i instantly typed obituary louis... and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and i had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. the feelings came rushing in, but there was no anxiety. it was just a combination of sadness and joy. as i walked through the park, i cried and laughed - i must have looked like a crazy person. i cried because i lost a great friend. i laughed because i was full of joyful gratitude. he saved my life. and, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.i decided that, while i missed his funeral, that i would place flowers at his office door. his office was right next door to a supermarket; so i ran in and got some flowers and a card. i quickly returned to my car and added the line... louis was a blessing in my life.i exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, you can't park here.... i turn with flowers in hand, my friend is dead, i just want to show him some respect. we argued a little and i told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, fine! i will move my car! i could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but i just didn't have the time or energy.i ran up the stairs to louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. all i could think of is that louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. i drove toward the attendant... he looked me in the eye as i approached. probably thinking i was going to flip him off or something. but i channelled my friend and said, i want to apologize. i was a jerk to you. my friend died and i am a little upset. but he trained me to see when i am spreading my pain around. you were just doing your job. the attendant told me, i am feeling really bad about this... i told him i am sorry for making you feel bad, but i am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. louis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.thank you louis. i love you! godspeed my brother.
unsubscribing because i need real help and this sub isn’t really supportive
sure some special people get advice and then get upvoted due to crowd upvoting. i’ve posted multiple times and i feel stupid and like i’m screaming into a void. i’d go into what’s wrong but what’s the point. thanks and hope other people have better luck.... they usually do.
sorry if this has been here before, i just relate so much.

looking back at my life i realized that i had stopped living life. i was literally just trying to get to the next day.
just living in the thought of tomorrow. it was like i was not living. just waiting.and the trouble was that, i didn't know what i was waiting for, i was kind of scared for what it might be.&#x200b;does anyone feel that way too?
the loneliest feeling in the world is having a panic attack at like 3am, with no one else home, and it feels like the whole world is asleep and you’re the only one awake.
that’s why i got a cat. 
my tattoo; a little serotonin for when i'm lacking

posting on reddit gives me anxiety - so this is me fighting that anxiety
i have been a lurker on reddit, and many other sites on the internet for many years now. it took me years until i could even bring myself to make a reddit account (and other accounts.) however, i could not bring myself to post anything or any comments no matter how badly i wanted to. in the past, i have posted a few things when i had been feeling brave enough to overcome my anxiety, but i always go back into hiding.the internet, and reddit, is supposed to offer a free medium for people to freely express and share their ideas, creations, thoughts, and opinions. despite amazing, silly, and positive things happening on reddit everyday, on social media there is social pressure. people wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.before i even wrote this i researched and found several older /r/anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how i felt.even though i tell myself that i don't care about validation from others, that i don't care about what others think or being judged, i still get anxiety. in the back of my mind, i still have fear that whatever i have to say or do is not worth expressing. that someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. that all of my thoughts are invalid. and because of that i shouldn't even try. better nothing than a negative outcome.on top of subconsciously fearing others, i fear myself. that whatever i have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. that my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.all throughout my school life, i have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. it was either 100% or 0%. which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  this post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.but at the moment, i am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. something, anything, is better than nothing. this post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how i write it, just the fact that i did it. that it doesn't matter if what i write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. and that my thoughts are valid because they exist. as long as am i alive, i am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. reddit is just one small way of doing so.   
why do i get text back anxiety?
rationally, i know that people are busy living their lives. but why do i get the horrible anxious feeling whenever my boyfriend goes a whole day without calling or texting me?he is a busy man, and i know that he gets tired after a long work day. i'm not a naggy girlfriend either, but my dumb brain goes into overdrive always thinking about silly scenarios of why he's not answering me.he doesn't like you anymoreyou're not important enoughhe forgot about you again today, maybe another girl is distracting himin reality, he probably just fell asleep.but he always says goodnight first ...urgh!!please tell me i'm not the only one! help!edit: thank you all who have responded. it truly means a lot to me to know that i'm not totally insane or alone! i agree that there are many factors involved, it's not 100% me. although i feel like i need some distraction strategies to help me with the overthinking :/
i got my first 'real' job and survived my first day--8 hours--without letting my panic take control.
yesterday was a giant victory for me. i recently got a job at a pet store i had wanted so badly and got through my first day without having a panic attack. i'd been putting off getting a better job to replace the 'job' i had before--working 2-8 hours a week at my mom's store for about 3 years now. i can actually start saving money and hopefully move forward with my life once i have some savings. i work again today but only for 4 1/2 hours. i mostly watch and clean up after a couple dozen puppies, and even through all the poop and smells i really love interacting with them all. for the first time in years i feel like i'm making true progress past my anxiety and depression and it feels empowering. just wanted to share c:
i hate calling people
especially when it's people who call asking for information (doctor, insurance, etc.)&#x200b;if i tell them i don't know, they seem to get frustrated at me. sorry that i don't know everything.
i made a small accomplishment today! i managed to go to the gym alone.
after months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, i decided that i needed to challenge myself and do something that i haven’t done before. usually i go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise i feel overwhelmed. i had gotten kinda out of shape as i haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. honestly, i’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way i look so i really wanted to change that before it gets worse. for me, working out is one of the few things that i actually enjoy doing! a bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. i kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if i get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? no one really cares about what others do in the gym. with this in mind, i managed a great workout session and i plan to keep it up. i feel amazing! taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take.  i hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️ 
after 6 months of struggling to get a job i’ve finally done it!!
i have been trying for 6 months to battle back anxiety and apply for jobs and not shut the world out completely. it’s been super rough and my mental health and self worth took a lot of battering from all the times i was rejected or ignored.but today, today i get a win. i got a job with a lovely stationary and gift shop and i love it there, the boss and coworkers are so kind and forgiving and helpful in my training, the customers have been polite and i’m genuinely enjoying being out and around people.it feels so good to have this breakthrough and despite there being a lot more i have to work on to be better, i got a win. i’ve gone from not being able to leave my room, and cringing at any stimulus, to being here now. i wanted to share the love and hope, know it may take awhile but the perfect opportunity is coming, trust guys! hope you guys get a win soon even something small, getting out of bed and doing anything that makes you happy is a win to me. i love you all, hope this can brighten your days. :)
guys if anyone is out there i’m feeling really small and deflated and i just found this sub for the first time i just wanted to say that reading your posts is so heartwarming and you guys all seem so nice 

friendly reminder to anyone in the the us (yes this includes cali and florida, you're not exempt): if you have anxiety or depression, this is the time to get tested for low vitamin d and possibly start supplements. winter blues are upon us folks
winter blues and seasonal depression can make anxiety much worse. so its worth it to go get tested for low levels which is very common. and its recommend to take up to 5000iu of d3. not d2.
is it just me, does anyone else’s chest feel tight and have a slight headache most of the day every day?

anyone get anxious about calling out of work?
i just sent the message to my manager saying i can’t make it. i’m on my period and these cramps are really painful and i’m sweating like crazy. i almost passed out a few months ago from period pain and this feels even worse. i’ve been having really bad headaches for like two months now and today it feels a lot worse (most likely because of my period).i just feel terrible for calling out :( i love working with everyone there and hate letting everyone down. but i did what i had to do, so now i’m just gonna wait to see if my boss replies back. i’m anxious knowing that i’ve done this. 
sometimes anxiety tells me everyone will hate me and laugh the moment i am noticed, but then depression tells me that no one cares about me enough to even feel such strong emotions like hate....

anxiety is the sensation that nothing has ever been okay, and never will be.

does anyone else get terrible anxiety from movers or cable guys coming over into your space? it completely depletes my energy, as if i ran for miles. serious fight or flight mode.

anxiety is like when video game combat music is playing but you can't find any enemies.

anyone else distract themselves by going on the internet?
every time i think about how shit my life is, i can’t help but fall into a wormhole which will probably end up in me cutting myself. the impending anxiety over everything wrong in my life is just too much >instead i just try to escape everything by going on the internet, watching youtube, video games, reddit. i just repress everything and try to find immediate satisfaction. anyone else feel the same?
when my counselor told me it's usually smart people who develop anxiety (x-post from r/adviceanimals)

if i’m more than 2 minutes late, i often don’t go to a class out of fear of what others will think
edit: so last i heckled this was at like 40 likes and i thought “well ok. a few people feel like this so that’s nice i’m not alone.” now i know i’m not alone out there in this. thanks for the support, peeps
i got a job!
i have lived with crippling anxiety since i was 17 (i am now 22).this caused me to become so ill i couldn’t even leave my house without being sick, i was put on medication when i was 19 which has helped me immenselyi never thought i would have a job but here i amit feels so surreal i’m proud of myself :)
frequently i will put headphones in and then forget to turn music on. i think it's because that little bit of muffling helps me calm down and think straight. kind of like a little hug - it's comforting. anyone else do this? or something similar?

today is a really, really, really, hard, no good, bad day.
and, like gad always is, i have no fucking reason to feel so guilty and scared. i just do. i hate this sensation. i'm hoping to lose myself in work and exercise today so i can just go to sleep again once the day is over. i'm thinking of everyone who struggles with this sensation like me, and i'm giving you all a huge hug. i just keep repeating that i/we're gonna get through it, and it's all going to be ok.
i check to make sure my alarm is set at least 10 times before i go to bed. anyone else do this?
i have 2 alarms set for work. one is my phone and the other is an actual alarm clock. anyway, the night before i’m afraid the alarm is set wrong or it won’t go off so i constantly check it before i go to bed. anyone else do this?
i just gave my number to a girl!
i had just gotten off the subway and had to get on the bus, i saw this cute girl and we sat together on the bus, i thought about it for a while and said to myself if she doesn't get off on this stop, i'll give her my number and when she didn't get off i wrote i like your style, if you want to get to know each other here's my number and handed it to her just before i got off the bus.pretty sure she's not gonna text or anything but this is huge for me, my hands are still shaking and i just wanted to share! -edit : typos and grammar\-second edit, it's been pointed out to me that what i've done could/would cause anxiety in others and what i did was wrong, i'm sad that i might have made someone feel like how i feel every day, but nevertheless i'm happy for overcoming some part of my anxiety but not about the way i went about it.\-third edit, thank you everyone for the nice and informative comments, i see now that people have different opinions and i shouldn't think too much about it to the point that i can't go to sleep (i should've went to sleep about 3 hours ago but couldn't)\-fourth edit, thank you kind stranger for the gold!
i utterly hate it when someone tells me that i am wrong. not because i want to be right but because it makes me feel that i am an idiot or inadequate
i assume that everyone else wants to be right about something and i assume that everyone feels sad when they find out that they are wrong and my judgement tells me that the average person manages to accept it and get it over.but good lord, when i come to the realisation that i was wrong about something, whether it was a random thought or something that was carefully thought, i feel a deep anxiety and deep insecurity and eventually, i start to panic and cannot think at all, almost like i suddenly became an idiot or my iq score dropped my 30 points. i am not sure why this happens to me and why i feel like i am personally attacked or feel like i am punched in the stomach when i find out that i was wrong about something *(my judgement tells me that either it is because i was raised in a semi-strict background with pushy parents where if you are not on the right, then you are definitely on the wrong; or because i am someone who always took school seriously and when school events are involved like exams or even a classroom interaction, if you posted the wrong answer or the wrong statement, then that means that you are definitely wrong and you get a lower score and in turn, that score affects your self-worth and self-confidence in your ability on whether you are able to think critically)*but holy fucking god, the fucking of insecurity and despair and the ultimate feeling of self-betrayal and shame just feels like i am somehow struck by lightning and i feel like i am shocked from the inside and cannot move or think or feel. as if my own brain is hijacked
when anxiety makes you want to do things but depression makes you want to stay in bed
how do people cope?! my anxiety is like “you have a deadline” and my depression is like “it’d be really nice to just lay here all day”. it’s to the point where i’m submitting coursework an hour before it’s due because i have almost zero motivation but still get stressed because of the anxiety. i’ve been on propranolol and citalopram for about 11 weeks. the propranolol is great for the physical symptoms of anxiety but citalopram is doing nothing for my depression.
anxiety as an older male sucks
society tells men to be strong, to be stoic and easily face fears. but as an older male with anxiety it just really sucks. i know women won't find me attractive if i'm anxious or more anxious then them, i get it, they don't want to feel the need to take care of me. also when i'm with other men they see me as weak and often bully and tease. just wanted to vent about how shitty it is being an older male with severe anxiety, socially, makes me even more suicidal. just want out of this anxious persons body and mind, just want out of all this sometimes.
if anxiety is keeping you awake right now...
that's fine.i know you'd rather be asleep. i would too. but we'll get there eventually.try not to feel bad if you have something to do tomorrow and you're worried you'll be tired while you do it. that happens to everyone.if the idea of not sleeping right now really stresses you out, get up and do something low impact but productive. update your calendar for the week. start watching that netflix show you keep meaning to check out. maybe wash those few dishes that you didn't get to before bed. sort laundry (this is my favourite, because i hate doing it and often put it off, and it's quiet.) or pop onto reddit and leave a helpful message for someone.
shout out to all the s.o.'s who accept us
today was a really bad day for me. for some reason, i could not settle down, even when we went out for a round of golf with the gorgeous weather. i was literally shaking the entire time and was trying to control every aspect of the day.i did check myself, and relinquished control and eventually calmed down. i mentioned to my better half that i was having one of those days and all she said was i know, i get it, we're cool.i took her out for dinner and drinks and our evening ended on a very good note.
be aware of your distorted thinking
in general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 1) **probability overestimations**- exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. examples: thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. most what if... type thoughts. 2) **all or nothing type thinking**- black/white thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly grey area. judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. this type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. examples: interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- if it's not positive than it must be negative. -on diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire xl pizza & wings b/c your diet is ruined anyway due to the cupcake. 3) **catastrophic thinking**- exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the worst possible case does come true.  example: if this first date doesn't go well i will probably die alone with 80 cats. when in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. in reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.it will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me when in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 4) **personalization**- blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. example that was an awkward conversation because i am awkward. when in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.5) **mind reading**- making assumption about what others think. example: that server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 6) **selective attention and memory**- this is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. if you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to evidence that is consistent with your beliefs. kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. example: you notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).what types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? what are some specific examples? 
anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?
34 year old male, diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety.  &#x200b;i would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  even when i'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.  &#x200b;its only gotten worse with age.  when i was a little bit younger id push through the anxiety and make sure my voice was heard, i would say avoiding confrontation is a behavior i've learned over the years and now it's almost impossible for me to confront someone without stuttering and stammering through it, and that is if i even have the balls to confront someone in the first place.   then, i wind up even more pissed off and upset because i end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or i just shut down and get super depressed.  &#x200b;i just started therapy for my anxiety, am wondering if anyone with similar fears has had success through therapy and beating this type of anxiety
i went to the store by myself today
edit: thank you all for your encouraging words❤️
i immerse myself in tv shows like scrubs and how i met your mother to make up for the absence of real life friend groups.
probably why i've become more active on this site, too. (*not for lack of trying.)
take a moment to breathe.

anyone else feel safer in confined spaces? on rough days i just hide away in my own little world under a blanket and draw stuff. anxiety can’t get in here.

i did it
i actually went to my first ever university lecture and stuff and it was great.all this worry for nothing! start of a bright future i hope!edit - i've read all replies and comments and it's so nice to feel like i am not alone with this <3 thank you all!
anyone else with high functioning anxiety?
don't mean to rank forms of anxiety, which is why i used the scare quotes - i saw three or four therapists who told me, wow, sounds like you're doing really well! before seeing one who took my anxiety seriously. i'm always early to things, i'm an exceeds expectations performer at my job, recently finished grad school with a solid gpa, have a great relationship with my significant other and my family, and i just feel all kinds of bad most of the time.anyway, cbt didn't work super well and as nice as my therapist was, they were too expensive/didn't take insurance, so i'm just managing by myself. it's not going super well.anyone else in a similar boat? what are you doing that helps you feel better? since finishing grad school, i plan to try and find a treatment plan depending on my pcp's recommendations.thank you <3
i had a panic attack at work today in front of a room full of patients
i work as a receptionist in a gp. been there a couple of months. today was the first time someone shouted at me. her appointment was moved from with a doctor to an advance nurse who i explained could also deal with the issue she was having. she slowly got very angry and i ended up crying sat at the desk after she left (missing her appointment). i had to call my coworker down and sat in the toilet for like 10 minutes then 20 minutes with my boss trying to catch my breath. all in all took me over 50 minutes to breath normally again.i've always had anxiety but never had a panic attack. i've never had a panic attack before, i think it's as i started citalopram last week. they're only 10mg so i'm surprised at how much its effected me.cheers for reading! just trying to come to terms with what happenededit: blown away by the response! not just upvotes but real advice, i posted this in a few sub's to try to get some light shed on what happened and this has just been so helpful and supportive, thank you!
does anyone else have an extremely chill side to them
like yeah, i have crippling social anxiety, but also half the time i just don’t care about anything at all and i act so chill and depending on the situation i’m either panicking on the verge of a mental breakdown or don’t have a care in the world and there’s no in between. i feel like i don’t even know what i’m actually like. i like to think i’m super chill but i’m probably not. am i crazy or are other people like this lmao.
me: all i want is a friend, anxiety: all i want to be is alone
the cruel irony
exercise... seriously, do it.
i have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. i’ve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years). over the years i have used cbt, therapy, and mindfulness meditation to reduce my anxiety with moderate success, but i still “slip” a lot and it can come back with a vengeance sometimes. i recently kind of “stumbled” into exercise. i used to hate it and dread it as nothing more than a means to burning calories and eventually losing weight. but after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which i’ve known for years) i casually just said “ok what the heck?”. lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can’t i try this as a form of medicine? so for the last week, my husband and i have been waking up at five to work out before work (i’ve learned that it never happens after because i’m a teacher and i get exhausted at work). the results? amazing. i have felt more at ease in the last week than i have in years. i only work out for thirty minutes and i do a variety of strength and cardio. the type of exercise does not seem to have any effect on the amount of relief. even just a brisk walk can do it. i can not recommend it enough. don’t wait to try it like i did. seriously. a doctor gave me this advice years ago and i wish i would have listened. go get your cdc-recommended 150 minutes a week and see what it does for your anxiety. i think you will be amazed. 
how my anxiety feels to me (constant struggle to stay on the surface)

try this pill , take this supplement, this might make you suicidal but it could relieve you from anxiety , this antidepressant will work but not forever , higher dose, to high now you have side effects , to low...nothing . let’s try something else. for fucksake i just want to feel normal !

overcame a panic attack on my own for the first time!
triggers: i talk about my panic attack i’m so happy i could cry! so there i was, at starbucks, i had too much caffeine (which i shouldn’t truly be consuming to begin with) and i feel a panic attack coming on and coming on strong. usually i try to shove it down. it never works but i still do it until i inevitably spiral.but there was this barista sweeping by me. he and i had spoken a few times before this visit and i recalled him saying he was taking a summer course at the nearby community college.i had my earphones in, trying to listen to music and shakily eat a bagel to calm down. i have social anxiety and have been trying to do some things to get over that these past few weeks such as, smiling when i make eye contact with people and attempting to have casual conversations. but there i was, debating whether or not i should even try casually talking to this guy in the midst of forcing back a panic attack and a strong urge to cry. after about a minute (maybe a few, not sure it felt like eternity though) i just turned my head to face him and did it! i asked him how his class was going and although i was very shaky (vocally and physically), we ended up having a great conversation. we briefly touched on my anxiety. i even lightheartedly made a joke about choosing whether to have a bagel or panic attack and i seriously don’t know how this didn’t kill the conversation. i wish i could remember what he said afterwards or how the conversation kept flowing. somehow we ended up talking about a bunch of things. it wasn’t until the end of the conversation that i realized, my panic attack was gone. all the symptoms of my attack were gone as well (i don’t want to list them and trigger someone).not saying for people to try this at all, i’m just happy i overcame a panic attack and wanted to share this excitement with somebody. tldr: ended up striking up a conversation with a barista when forcing back a panic attack and ended up overcoming it instead of spiraling for the first time!edit: thank you guys so much!!! all of this positive feedback and encouragement means so much to me. it seriously hits my core. i sincerely wish i could hug each and every one of you (,: i’ve been trying to reply to as many of the comments as possible. i deeply appreciate this, i really do and i hope you’re all having a wonderful day because you’re all beautiful people ❤️
waking up with anxiety
does anyone else ever wake up with anxiety that they cannot explain. your heart races, stomach is flipped and you feel in complete panic. i’m not sure why this keeps happening but its always first when i wake up and its one of the worst feelings in the world :(  
when you have so much to do so you’re stressed and anxious. but you’re too depressed to do anything.
i’m so exhausted i just want to nap. but then when i wake up i’ll have all this work to do. i am so low atm. can life just stop for a moment so i can catch up help :( 
does anyone else feel anxious because they’re calm? it’s like wow i shouldn’t feel this good, time to feel like shit.
today i took a 40 minute bath and focused on breathing. i also used an app called headspace (can’t recommend this enough) to meditate and entered a very calm state of mind. now it’s been 4 hours and i’m still sort of calm from it. but every couple of minutes or so i’ll question why i’m feeling so good, think i shouldn’t feel this good, and start to get anxious. does anyone else share this feeling?
does anyone else feeling guilty when doing nothing?
every time i think about giving myself some me time i get extremely guilty and anxious. there's always something else i should be doing or could be doing. my mind will physically not let me have a day off and it's exhausting. every time i try to just relax and watch a movie i get attacked by my anxiety telling me the things i should be doing and working on and how i'm going to be a failure and how nothing is going to work out.
does anyone else's anxiety mean they can't ever enjoy/do anything on sunday because of work the next day?
like, i can't even leave the house or do anything outside of the house the day before i have to work because my anxiety tells me there is no point. it is hard to explain..but i just feel i can't do anything the day before work because i will be too stressed and anxious about work the next day and if i went out of the house to do anything, i would be constantly looking at my watch to see how long is left until i have to work (18 hours, 12 hours etc.) and feel sick with anxiety.by staying in i can try and maintain a routine that helps me, but it is becoming harder as now it is creeping into my saturdays and i am beginning to not want to go out on saturdays now either. it is so hard to explain why i do this, i am not even sure. people are starting to notice. does anyone else experience this and have found any ways to manage this? 
i’m sorry if this gets asked a lot but... does anyone else feel too “normal” to not have a mental illness but not “crazy” enough to actually have one?
i think about this a little more than i should... and then i keep saying “you have nothing wrong with you! your parents were right, you’re just faking it for the attention! and then think about that until you cry? bothers me. 
does anyone else feel like they're just a nuisance to other people?
i feel like any time i interact with most people, i feel like i'm just a drag on them. 
i finally made an appointment with a therapist!
and i feel so good about it, i can finally start my road to healing :)
stop clenching your teeth
someone once posted this and it hit home with me immediately. with the holidays coming and the weather turning, there's lots to stress about. you only get one set of teeth, and nobody needs a headache on top.it'll be ok. you're beyond worthy - you're incredible! we're lucky to have you.
does anxiety make you nauseous?

anyone else get a vague sense of dread and emptiness at night?
during the day i'm fine but at night i feel....wrong
does anyone else find job searches paralysing?
my (30f) anxiety has been around on and off for years. most days it’s really manageable but as soon as it concerns finding a job, it goes off the charts. it’s as if something deep inside me is triggered and i experience panic attacks, shaking and vomiting. i don’t really know what i want to do with my life, career wise. i’ve jumped from job to job, not really liking anything for long periods of time. i stick with something for a while (because at first it’s fine) until i hate it so much i have to leave. and then i spiral, into a whirlpool of terror, shame and fear. recently i found a job i really liked and then management changed and the new boss is awful. my anxious brain says she’s toxic but she’s honestly probably not that bad. but she has changed my job role enough that i’m no longer doing what i loved and am a glorified cleaner...so i know i have to leave. but after speaking to mum last night about how i struggle to browse job ads because it’s so hard, she basically said “this happens all the time. you get bored of a job and then panic about finding a new one, you’re just going round and round in circles”. and that set off a middle of the night panic attack. i dont know what i want to do with my life and i have no idea why the thought brings me such fear. help?
i get why people with mental health problems don't tell others about
you'll just get gas-lighted with every issue you have with others and it would be made to seem like you're the one with the problem. it's a bittersweet ordeal because the accusers are always trying to be so above it all and pretend to be some sort of arm chair therapist, telling you to get help. i have anxiety, trust and believe when i say i don't go up attacking people. there's a lot of instances where i don't even talk with people at all.
i got a steady job!
i did it, y'all! i'm got a steady full time job!it started out with just an application, then an interview, then training, then my my licensing exam yesterday. even though i was so nervous through out each step of the process, i'm so thankful and proud that i was able to get this far.yesterday as i was waiting for the scores to come back on my exam, i felt sick and wanted to vomit. the suspense was killing me and the entire time i was training, i also kept thinking how awful a job i was doing. but you know what? everything turned out okay. good things can happen. your anxiety isn't right until it's actually right and something bad has happened, so screw it! do your best!edit: thank you so much everyone! i'm glad to have your support. those of you who are waiting to hear back from your job hunts, i wish you the best of luck. we can do this!!!
does anybody else disassociate?
i think that's the word i'm looking for. anyway, whenever i feel an anxiety attack coming on i can physically feel myself leave my body to prevent it from happening. if someone tries to talk to me i become really distant and short. i look into the distance a lot and just try not to be in the moment, because if i am the anxiety will overwhelm me.does anybody else experience this or anything like this? or does anybody know how to deal with this when it happens?
anyone else get really worried and restless ~2 hours before having to leave the house?
anytime i have an obligation i get really stressed. i can't take a nap cause then i might oversleep, i don't really have enough time to do anything, cook something, watch something....but at the same time it's still too early to leave, cause then i'd just be sitting around at the placeso i just sort of pace around and feel annoyed
my first tattoo

i draw my panic attacks now...

i wish we all could meet each other, show each other lots of respect and love and tell each other how great people we are!
heh, by the way i'm from tbilisi, georgia. had all y'all lived here, i'd organise everything. one love!
“anything you’ve ever said can and will be used against you” - anxiety

i fucking did it
i sent a simple hey to my crush. currently awaiting answer. i feel like this is going to be a great day, because i know she likes me back, but she is just as shy.
it will pass

so i voted today and was shaking so badly i couldn't put my ballot into the scanner someone had to do it for me.
but you know what i actually don't feel that bad about it. all it was is a physical response and barely anyone noticed. normally i would be obsessing about it all day but i'm not. so i thought that i would share i'm actually proud because i didn't let my anxiety prevent me from voting. 
it's late! don't google whatever your anxious about!
we all know anxiety makes us google things late at night and then you panic and google something else! you're not alone! fight the urge!
i wish my teachers understood that group projects can be debilitating for those with social anxiety.
failed social studies today because i didn't help anything at all in the group project. but truth is i really really wanted to help i just didnt have enough courage to approach my group mates
not being able to tell the difference between anxiety and a “gut feeling”
and therefore constantly doubting yourself.... hahahh so much fun.
i envy my friends and others who don't suffer from mental illness / anxiety.
i am the only person i know of that suffers from extreme, crippling anxiety (thats why reddit makes me feel less alone). i feel a tinge of jealously when i see my friends able to just live life to the fullest without mental illness issues. and of course everyone has problems and i am in the midst of an anxiety crisis, so its making me feel extra weary. i just wish i could live my live without what feels like carrying an impossibly heavy load on my shoulders. i go to therapy twice a week and the medications ive tried made me feel horrible. sometimes this shit feels like a curse... i have beauty, intellect, drive and potential but i feel imprisoned by my anxiety when i go through these stressful times. *end rant* 
is anyone else incapable of using noise canceling headphones in public?
i just get a feeling i’m missing something or i’m in danger and can’t tell cause i can’t hear well. is this common with anxiety or is this something else?edit: my first post on here and its a big difference taking to people with anxiety about something like this and people with “anxiety”edit: first ever reward thank you sm, i don’t deserve it especially on a post like this.
shoutout to everyone who's to nervous to use the ring bell for service bells

hoarding books/ebooks because you want to learn, and then not reading them because you're too anxious about not being able to absorb what's in them
anybody else suffer with this? it's a combination of a spending problem (the acts of purchasing the books) and a reading-anxiety problem (with not being able to follow along with a book's text)
''have you tried meditation?''
anyone a bit tired of hearing this
i just sold my first piece of artwork!
like many things, this may sound small to others but i've always had a lot of passion for creating things but was scared to put myself out there.i've gotten pretty good with video game assets and art and decided to put some stuff online. i just made my first $1, it's pretty much nothing but i'm still really proud i can't lie
a dumb (but useful!) little anxiety trick.
tl;dr i have a method for remembering that i did something, so i won’t be worrying all day about whether or not i did it, and worrying about the consequences of forgetting to have done it.ok so sometimes before work i use my hair straightener. i’m usually in a rush and have to unplug it before i go on my way, of course. but sometimes more often than not i’d be at work freaking out that i *forgot* to unplug it, freaking out that my house was currently burnt to bits, a pile of ash and debris on my lawn.so i end up texting my mother (who i live with) asking her to please check that i unplugged it. the thing is, more often than not, i did. in fact i almost always do, and if i don’t, *it shuts off automatically anyway*. yet i still find myself at work stricken with anxiety, wondering if i unplugged my hair straightener.it’s an outlandish thing to be so worried about, considering i usually unplug it and it shuts off itself anyway, but my google search is still filled with “chances of my house burning down from hair straightener” “how long do automatic shut-off hair straighteners stay on” “hair straightener fire”... it’s not good.then recently i decided i needed something to remind me, concretely, that i did unplug it in the mornings when i do. so this is going to sound kind of silly or stupid, but now in the mornings when i unplug it i say, out loud, “i am unplugging my hair straightener”.i don’t know why it works. maybe because i say it out loud and hear it back to me and that reassures me. maybe it’s because it’s a strange action (saying what you’re doing out loud to nobody) that makes me remember that i did it. i have no idea, but once i started doing this i no longer doubt whether i unplugged my hair straightener, the memory sticks in my mind and i can relax.so i thought i would inform the people on r/anxiety about it to see if they do anything similar, or could maybe benefit from this. perhaps this would fall under more of an ocd thing but i’ve only ever been prescribed with anxiety so i’m not sure that would apply. but yeah, hope you enjoyed reading about my insanity.
social anxiety perceived as rude
i have general anxiety as well as pretty horrible social anxiety. it gets taken as me being rude then i'm more anxious around people the next time i see them once i know they don't like me because of it . vicious cycle . 
how do you all deal with “everyone at work hates me and i’m sure they’re looking for reasons to fire me” anxiety when you know you’ve never done anything to warrant that?
you know the feeling?“that group is polite to me, but i’m sure they don’t like me.”“the boss is friendly, but i’m sure he/she is scrutinizing me for faults”“i’m sure everybody hates me for that tiny mistake i made once and no one’s forgotten about.”you feel this way even though there’s no logic behind it and your rational brain tells you you’re the only one hung up on this. does anyone else deal with this, and how do you cope?
does anyone else feel cringe trying to have a normal conversation?
no matter what i try and think of saying, i always think it's cringe or just wierd to say even if it isn't.does anyone else have this problem? and if so how do you get around this thought in your head stopping you from having a conversation or keeping a good one flowing? i just don't know what to say off the top of my head so i need to think what to say but whatever i come up with just doesn't feel like it's either worth saying or just sounds dumb
i may have just quit my job.
i’m not sure. i did walk out. manager came down today because employee a and b were fighting. instead of speaking to anyone she stopped in front of me and screamed about how everyone is going to cut the shit and she’s not dealing with it.  the. she screamed some more about us listening to her and stormed out. i’ve been having a panic attack since. i just went to talk to her to tell her i needed to leave and she started right back at yelling. so i snapped and told her that this was an unacceptable way to speak to employees, that i was leaving and i might be back on monday if i want to continue being verbally abused. then i texted the manager, who of course wasn’t there, and told her i need to speak to her before i return. because of this is an acceptable way of dealing with employees i won’t be back. so i think i quit my job. and i’m still sobbing and shaking, 4 hours after the attack started.edit: thank you all so much. i did not expect the outpouring of support, and i cannot tell you all how much it means to me!
has anyone ever vomited from having such high anxiety?
23 f. gad/depression/usa recently i feel like my anxiety is consuming my life. i’m on no medications for it. i’ve been unable to sleep at night, i can’t calm myself down anymore. today i was so worked up on my way to work that i started to feel sick and i didn’t even make it all the way to work before i had to pull over and get sick. it was weird because it wasn’t like a lot. just one swift projecting vomit and then it was over. is this a symptom of anxiety?edit: thank you for all the comments everyone i came back to like 44 notifications so it’s a lot to read through but i just want you all to know i appreciate each one of your responses and insights into your own experiences 
anybody else ever spend so much time in your head, that when you get up to do something your brain feels totally fried?
i (20f) know it’s bad for my anxiety but all i’ve done today is lay around in my pajamas posting on here and worrying about my current situation or my future or the possible problems my relationship might encounter even though nothing is wrong between us right now. i think about having a possible nervous breakdown from worrying so much, then having to go to a mental institution, then becoming severely depressed while there because i’m so ashamed of myself for getting to that state, then having a suicide attempt because i can’t take it all. or how i feel trapped physically and mentally. meanwhile i’m just sitting on my toilet writing this. i’ve been running through these thoughts all day. but now my energy is so low that i don’t know what to do. i need to go do something productive because my mind is eating itself. except now i have more anxiety because i feel like i’m in a dream or just floating around since my brain is so exhausted. and now i’m thinking “what if this is dissociation or depersonalization?” that gives me more anxiety. i want to sleep but then i think about how sleep is bad for me in this situation too. **lmao**. i hate bad anxiety days man. hopefully tomorrow is better. love you all ❤️
your feelings are uncomfortable, but they are not dangerous.
you have a choice when it comes to your feelings. your body is releasing stress hormones because it thinks you are in danger because you have trained it to think it is in imminent danger. i know, because i trained my mind and body to do the same thing.accept your feelings for what they are: physical sensations sent by your brain to bluff you because it doesn’t know any better.choose which thoughts you follow. when the negative thoughts come, let them come but just don’t follow them because they too are a bluff. a pattern you have fallen into.if you want something to remind yourself that it’s a bluff, like a prescribed emergency medication or a recording or a mantra or whatever, use it, but accept your feelings and choose your thoughts. you have that power, it’s just buried under anxious nerves.full disclosure, i’ve always been anxious as long as i remember. i’ve been medicated for about 7 years now but have never attended therapy (working on it, american healthcare and all that). recently i have had more panic attacks than ever before, or at least that i’m aware of (looking back i may have chalked some up to being high or drunk as a misguided youth).but this last time i just happened upon the work of clair weekes by way of youtuber wonderbro.i don’t mean to say that you don’t need medication or therapy. that’s not what this is about. this is about the reality that those things can bring you to if you let them.i had a panic attack one week ago. it was bad, i vomited. and like the previous attacks, every day since i have woken up only to have a feeling of dread and tension in my arms wash over me. but i am learning to accept these feelings for what they are: a bluff.on top of that, i’m giving up caffeine and alcohol to help myself heal, i’m going to hold myself to mindfulness meditation every day using the oak app recommended by a friend.i mean well and i hope this comes across the way i mean it.healing isn’t easy or fast but i believe all of us can do it.accept your feelings.choose your thoughts.
fuck anxiety.
fuck anxiety.

that’s not how this works...
i told my mom i have to go back to the psychiatrist to get a refill on my medication. she’s like cool maybe they can lower it! i’m like ummm no. my depression has stabilized but my anxiety has gotten worse. she’s like wtf what do you have to be anxious about you’re fine! i’m just like.....mom...that’s not how this works.......anybody else have to deal with parents/friends who don’t understand?
when i’m out in public by myself i feel like everyone is watching me and it makes me hyper-aware of my movements and extremely uncomfortable?
i’m 23/f and i’ve only realized this in the past few years but it’s a feeling i had normalized for as long as i can remember.  i feel like anytime i’m out in public that people are just watching me and so i’m hyper-aware of how i’m walking, where i’m putting my arms, and in general whatever i’m doing. but the thing is, it’s not really that i think people are viciously judging me, it just feels, for example, like i’m doing normal everyday things except there’s an stadium of people watching, like obviously you’d feel like your every move was being monitored and it’s extremely uncomfortable and tense. even if i’m in the car by myself when i stop at a stoplight i think all the people in cars around me are looking at me, also i can’t walk my dogs in the daylight because i feel like everyone is watching me from their houses or cars that are driving by are watching me too. and when i’m at school walking around campus or in classes, and it’s all i think about in these situations. i can’t relax in any public setting alone and it’s so awful of a feeling that when i can avoid it i will. i wont even go sit in the library or go to the student union at school, i’ll go sit in my car instead (i’m in my senior year and i’ve been in the student union alone maybe 4x).if i have to go in public alone i try to do whatever i have to, as fast as i can. though when i’m with someone that i’m comfortable with i don’t really think about that at all or if i do it’s very very minimal. i would like to be able to go out and feel at ease when i do things like, go to the gym, walk my dogs, go to classes, go to the stores, go to the movie theatre,  etc. but i’ve been like this for so long i’m not even sure how i could get better at this point? does anyone experience this or know how to deal with it? 
does anybody else delete reddit post immediately after getting downvoted?
so yeah, everytime i post something and it gets downvoted i quickly delete the post out of fear of sounding stupid or getting judged. whenever i get downvoted, i automatically overthink about it, like what if i said something wrong. and honestly because of this i am starting to hate posting on reddit. 
anyone else have brain fog all the time?
ever since a week or two ago i've had trouble remembering things and it feels like i've been experiencing pretty bad derealization. its like i'm hyper aware of everything that goes on around me. i feel zombified. this started soon after i began taking buspar and then upped my dose so i dont know if that could be causing it.
dae have a foggy feeling in their head, like you can't concentrate on anything, whenever you are experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety?

remember that even if no one comments on your post here, lots of us read it, felt solidarity, then creeped on.
stay strong out there buds
my method for sleeping with anxiety
it's no joke. this sub lights up like a christmas tree at night. with some forms of anxiety, trying to fall asleep is the absolute worst. i've been battling it for many years and i think i have found one way that works for me.staying busy (mentally) is the best way to keep anxiety at bay so when we stay busy physically, we can manage. at night, the busy goes away, so our brains start churning. these thoughts lead to physical changes in our bodies that make us feel like total shit and make it hard to sleep.  i.e. increased heart rate, tension grinding, stomach pain...etc. we can't control the physical stuff so we have to start with the mental stuff. you have to learn to manage your thoughts. sounds impossible, right? it's possible with practice. here is what i do. you have to avoid anything personal to you. i imagine a giant house. imagine entering this house. the first floor is a long hallway full of doors. behind each door is all the stuff you can think about that has no personal attachment to you. television shows you watch, movies, word games, number games (stay away from music because it tends to cause memory recall to something personal) the trick is to stay on the first floor. the second floor is anything personal to you. friends, family, job, school, tasks, money. all these things can trigger anxiety, regret, stress. if you catch yourself thinking about something on the second floor. back out immediately. the basement is the dark place. all your worst fears. avoid at all cost. as for thoughts that are not personal. you will find tricks that work for you. some things i do...take my favorite movie and put myself in it. i imagine myself in all the situations with all the characters and what i would say with them. same for favorite tv shows. what would i say to each and every character if i had the chance? word games. i try to come up with every word that is two letters only. i come up with words made from another word. stupid things like that. eventually, you fall asleep. i understand this whole thing sounds ridiculous and crazy but the trick is to not touch on anything personal to you. to control your thoughts so you can control the physical reaction to those thoughts. try it and let me know if it works for you. 
guys im getting a dog to help the anxiety
a dog!!!i talked about it with my mom and we agreed it could work if i promised to take care of him and allim super lonely so im really stoked to have a friend
i feel so lonely right now that it’s brought me to tears
i’m laying down in bed and for the moment there’s no one to talk to or hang out with and i’m so incredibly overwhelmed with anxiety that i would hug the shit out of the first person i saw. edit: wait my ribs are actually crushed from so many peeps virtually hugging me at once. so thankful for each piece of encouragement, much love to y’all. wow.
because of anxiety, people always think(even my boss) i'm either sad or angry all the time which further enhances my anxiety!

does anyone here get stuck in loops/intrusive thoughts?
it's the best way i know how to describe it honestly. i get really intense intrusive thoughts which range from wanting to drive my car into a ditch so i don't have to go to work tomorrow, or the second my boyfriend leaves my house it's like oh my god what if he gets into a car accident and dies and this was the last time i saw his face. i can never even recognize that i am doing it in the moment but i obsess and make myself physically sick with anxiety over it until something clicks and i'm fine again. like in one of the examples i mentioned above, the thing that clicks me back to normal would be when my boyfriend calls when he gets to his house. the entire time i am in the intrusive thought though, i feel like i am walking around in circles inside my head until my feet are bleeding and then i keep going. i have talked to my therapist about it and she mentioned that it sounded like obsessive compulsive tendencies (but i want to be clear that she did not diagnose me with ocd) but a solution was not really discussed. currently my diagnosis is general anxiety disorder, dysthymia, and ptsd. i am kind of at a loss because the intrusive thoughts are getting worse and affecting a lot of different areas of my life in really negative ways right now. breathing techniques don't work very well because i get annoyed at myself and it starts a whole new loop of not even being able to do that right. telling myself something like it is out of my control so i shouldn't worry about it doesn't even work because, again, i don't ever realize that i am doing it in the moments. i just don't know if there is some kind of preventative thing i could be doing or i don't know if medication would even help with that stuff because i don't understand how medication helps with anxiety and i come from a family who addicted to any and all narcotics so i have been worried to even try them and my therapists stance on that is that she trusts my judgement but i just don't fucking know and i feel so lost. please help in any way you can, i am losing my mind and i feel crazy.
you’re not weak if you ask for help. you’re not any less of a human being if you show your emotions. you don’t deserve to be in pain everyday of your life. you don’t. it isn’t your fault that your mind is telling you what it is. it’s not.

29 years old and im taking my 3rd driving lesson tomorrow!
finally i got to a point where i needed my license .  it has not been easy, but i am so proud of myself .  just writing this to maybe encourage others .
anyone else have their anxiety on-and-off. i’ll be fine for 2 months then bam my anxiety hits me again. then i’m fine again, then anxiety comes back and so on...
i don’t understand if this is normal. would be really helpful to know if someone else has this too. thanks.
i’ve been on 2 flights today, my first time going on a plane by myself, i got so little sleep that my eyes feel like they’re on fire, but i haven’t had mental breakdown
i consider this an accomplishment
does anyone else get really anxious over something that’s going to be fun?
i’m going to an arctic monkeys concert soon and i want to use this as an example for what i’m talking about. i’m really fucking glad igot tickets to go, don’t get wrong but i’m also weirdly anxious about it. i don’t really understand, maybe it’s because i don’t want anything bad to happen. i’ve found that this continues to happen for a bunch of other things too that i’m initially happy for. can anyone else relate?
does anyone else experience huge anxiety depression and a feeling of doom when you first wake up?
it doesn't seem to matter how good of a day i had the day before or what happened it seems i always wake up with lots of depression and anxiety that doesn't fade away until two or 3pm. it seems as though my day is predetermined, some mornings for whatever reason i wake up with no anxiety or depression and its like i'm a completely different person. its almost guaranteed that that day will be a good day but the next day is usually back to the same old feeling in the morning that take all day to overcome. i feel like if i could replicate the few days i don't wake up with anxiety that my situation would improve.
i was about to start crying but grabbed a pen and paper and wrote this instead. i didn’t cry. i’m going to buy a notebook.
it’s not me.i know it looks like me but it’s not me.i swear.i won’t name it or give it a pronoun because it doesn’t deserve one.just remember that i’m still in here.i swear.
i presented today!!!
i was nervous and had an anxiety attack before class and on my way. i took deep breaths, got up there and did it! i was a little shaky, but i did it and i passed! i feel so accomplished today. i even went out of my comfort zone and raised me hand to answer a question in class when the rest of the students didn't. my answer was for the most part correct ... regardless i am still proud because i didn't have much knowledge on the topic !!! yay!edit: thank you all so much for the positivity and support. you've all put such an enormous smile on my face. i haven't smiled in a long time, since i just lost my fishy friend and got dumped recently, so again thank you!!! i appreciate every single one of you <3edit: thank you for the silver kind stranger!!
does anyone feel like they don't have enough time no matter what

co-workers were down playing anxiety yesterday. pisses me off when i hear everybody has some kind of anxiety.
to clarify, i don't have anxiety. but my husband does. i've seen first hand what it can do to someone. at work yesterday (i'm at a salon) my co-workers were gossiping about some former co-worker of theirs and talking about how much of an attention whore she was and how she's nothing but crazy and drama. apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. she also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. i thought to myself, what's the big deal? but then they started saying things like oh she just wants attention, everybody has some form of anxiety, etc. i piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. the response i got was well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it. now i don't even know this person they were talking about. maybe she does just want attention. but maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention. i see the stories you guys post here. i have seen my own husband's anxiety and how it affects him. this shit sucks, and it's real. 
i recently explained to my girlfriend of 3 years that stuffed animals help me with my anxiety. this was her gift to me today. 

some my anxiety can get so bad that it makes me have to suddenly poop and makes me nauseous.
i have been working on my anxiety but sometimes when i have a really bad moment i have to suddenly poop and as i’m pooping i’m also nauseous so i have to throw up. and well it’s a mess. i’m not sure what to do when this happens, i just end up purging everything in my body and it’s so awful. it doesn’t happen very often but when it does wow it’s terrible.does this happen to anyone else? what do you do? why does this happen?
saw a thread about death and saw this and thought of this sub.

i deleted a post because i got anxiety when nobody responded to it...
i’m gonna keep this short because i don’t want to spend a long time writing another post that nobody will interact with. basically i wrote a post for a productivity subreddit explaining how i’ve been extremely unproductive over the last year and a half, only doing something productive for less than 3 hours out of any given day. i waited for over an hour for someone to offer solutions or to relate, but nobody commented and i didn’t even get so much as an upvote. i started to feel really stupid for posting it at all and i couldn’t stop thinking about how everyone who saw it probably thought i’m extremely lazy and have strange priorities and goals for my future. i probably could’ve left it up throughout the night and i’m sure someone would’ve eventually responded, but i was starting to feel anxious about what people must think of me. does anyone else feel this way when their post is ignored? edit: since this post has gotten a bit of attention, can anyone help with the issue i talked about in my deleted post that was ignored? so like...what helps you be productive in life? should i get a job (even though the thought of it gives me anxiety)? how do you stick to deadlines you set for yourself? i’m having trouble living a fulfilling life at the moment.
to my friends who suffer from anxiety in silence
some days at work are great, and others.. not so much. i got my first job earlier this year, after years of dreading it. here i am now, well liked at work by nearly everyone, making decent money (considering what i do), and financially helping my family. despite everything generally being great, i still have days where i can’t help but take a few minutes to cry in the bathroom at work. i think i hide it pretty well, and i don’t think anyone at work knows what i mess i am sometimes. i don’t ever talk to anyone about my anxiety in depth, and there are likely a lot of people here who suffer in silence too. if anyone is reading this at work right now, maybe in the bathroom trying to pull yourself together (or anywhere really), i believe in you and i’m rooting for you! this community is so kind and supportive. i truly believe we are all so brave and courageous and i just wanted to send out a nice message to anyone who may need to hear it from someone but doesn’t have anyone in their life to talk to about their anxiety. whether you’re overcoming a fear of talking to the cashier at the grocery store, or you’re scared to talk on the phone, or to leave your house, or maybe you’re like me and you’re just constantly shaky and worried for seemingly no reason but try to hold your head up high and carry on, i am so proud of you. celebrate every little accomplishment and step you take. because anxiety is so ugly and can be so debilitating, every little piece of success should be celebrated. i’m always here to chat if anyone needs a friend. i love this community so much. oo
big step for me.. seeing a psychologist today
it took a lot for me to admit i need help with anxiety.  hope this helps!edit: was referred to a psychologist who works with a psychiatrist in case meds are needed for relief.
my rational brain: you aren’t dying your heart is racing from anxiety anxiety: bitch you’re dying

my mental illness makes me feel childish and immature
i have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life. i got my first job 2 years ago. in that time, i have had 4 anxiety attacks/breakdowns at work. it happened just last week. i had really hoped that wasn't going to happen again but it did, and i feel so humiliated. most of my coworkers are my age or younger and they don't act like that. they don't hide in a closet crying and panicking for two hours. i also have a bunch of physical health problems that have caused me to have to leave early and call out numerous times. so i can't help feeling that i'm the problem child at work and everyone must think i'm such a drama queen. there's always *something* going on with me. i really try to hide it. i try to tough it out when i can and find private places to rest for a minute when i need it. i try not to let people see me get upset. i wish i could help people understand that i don't *want* to do this or be like this. they never say anything, but i'm certain they're silently judging me.anyway... yeah. anxiety sucks.
reddit doesn’t understand anxiety
there was an r/askreddit post that got some popularity the other day that said “what instantly put your anxiety from 0 to 100?” and people said things like, when a cop gets behind me, or when i lose my wallet, or when they’re at their mils house. and all of those things give me nerves, but they don’t compare to my anxiety. things that give me anxiety? when i touch my phone charger and it feels warm so i don’t want to charge anything the rest of the day in case it catches fire. when i leave my house and wonder if i left the hair straightener on even though i always every day turn it off. it’s a habit. but i still wonder. when i stand up and my foot is numb and i go check the mirror to make sure my face isn’t sloping and my eyes aren’t dilated in case i’m having a stroke. i’m in my 20s and have no health problems. driving, either riding or driving makes me anxious. these little things that never bothered me before now all of a sudden do. but just randomly. and that, to me, is what anxiety is. sure, a cop driving behind me makes me nervous. but it’s not the same.
does anyone else ever experience extreme depersonalization due to anxiety??
i am currently feeling like i have the biggest hole in my chest and i feel nothing??? i had a day off and i stayed home all day and played video games and had  no contact with the outside world and now that my boyfriend is home, i feel really bad because i’m not talking very much but i truly feel like i just can’t. it’s so odd. i just feel nothing. i’m on 25mg of zoloft btw 
just read this article about anxious depression and boy did it hit the nail on the head

anyone else feel psychological pain is worse than physical pain?
if i had major chronic pain issues, my opinion would be different, but i get mild pain sometimes as most people do, but for me i'm acutely aware of my bodily sensations and it leads to anxiety and often intense panic attacks.  even though i should be aware that the pain i'm feeling is from something i already understand that i have like acid reflux, my mind wants to connect some dots and believe i might be having an emergency situation.  no matter how many times it turns out to be nothing, i can't help but think it's not going to be nothing this time.  i feel like this fear is a thousand times worse than the pain itself.  i would take pain that is a couple times worse than the pain i get if it would mean i never have to feel anxiety.  it's to a point.  i've had an intense ear infection that i would trade for a panic attack.
have a positive day, you’re stronger than you know
just sending positive vibes to everyone here. we all know how frustrating and exhausting anxiety can be, don’t let that discourage you. you’re so much stronger and you have so much more life in you than anxiety will ever tell you. it’ll discourage you from living your life today. live your life anyway! i get bored at work so if anyone is having trouble feel free to comment/dm and i’ll at least send my regards even if i have no answers for you.
i would rather do nothing at all times and choose it over going to work, hanging out with friends, and taking classes. am i alone in this? how do i stop self sabotaging?
cross posted from r/getmotivated because i think they may be anxiety related, although therapy and meds have never helped this issue.i have some sort of mental block around so many things. i just choose... not to do them. even if they're things i really want to do or need to do.for example, today i woke up and needed to be at work at 7. and i just chose not to go and went back to sleep. i just don't care about the consequences of things until it's too late. i've struggled with this for years and i don't know what to do about it. and i always quit before i can get fired, so i've had like 10 jobs in the last two years. i ask people to hold me accountable, i've tried working from home, in an office, in food service, it happens with hangouts with friends and writing classes i take... i just choose not to do things.i have a lot of goals and dreams for myself. i want a lot for myself and i love to do a lot of things. but for some reason my love of doing nothing in the moment always overshadows my dreams. i literally envy people who break bones and stuff because they get to be bedridden for a month and have an excuse for just reading and watching tv and sleeping. i love sick days. i am constantly wishing i could just do nothing even though i feel good once i actually get out and accomplish things.does anyone else experience this? it makes me feel like i'm the biggest failure in the world.&#x200b;
she said yes!
after talking to this amazing girl for over 10 months, i finally got over my anxiety and asked her out, and she said yes!i just wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit for sharing your advice and giving me the courage to do this, you guys are the best!if anyone else is in a similar situation, just go for it and ask them out, even though i was shaking as i asked her this, i'm so glad that i finally did it, it's an amazing feeling.thank you all once again, i just wanted to share my little positive story :) 
in august, i had my first panic attack in years.  in september, i started drawing.

going to watch a movie at the cinema. wish me luck
i kinda stopped going because i was so damn anxious i couldn't focus on the movie, but i'm going to try again today. hope it goes welledit: i fucking did it! i was very stressed and near an attack when i was buying the ticket but as soon as i sat down and the film started i calmed down and enjoyed the entire 3h movie. if i did it, everyone can! you have to push yourself but you'll be happy once you do it
i think we can all relate. (found on ifunny -__-)

post drinking anxiety
anyone else get bad anxiety the next day? over thinking everyone you said/did. putting stuff totally out of context.
does anyone notice an increase of anxiety at night? i’ve noticed that trend in myself recently and wondered if it’s common.

just a little video to help anyone here :)

anxiety is so rude.
that is all. that's my whole speech.
i think you guys will get this..

i walked to the gas station for the first time by myself and bought a drink
it took me a few trys because i kept going back inside but i finally walked down the rode to the gas station. i never went to a shop and paid something by myself because of the anxiety.you guys are really sweet i love y'all :)
relationship anxiety and constant worrying, i’m so sick of it
i have no idea how to deal with this anymore, i’m so sick of irrationally worrying about every small thing; worried if she’s happy, worried if she’s going to leave, worried she’s sick of me and my fucking issues, worried when we don’t talk in the immediate moment, worried when she makes a joke, worried when she doesn’t make a joke. i have an abrupt minimally hostile reaction to almost everything, i can’t take a joke anymore and handle change or big plans awfully. i feel like i need to take hours to think about every small thing that happens in our life but i know i can’t do that because you can’t just spend 8 hours every day thinking your feelings out, that’s fucking exhausting. just constant rumination/unsettled feeling with no foundation behind it but my own insecurity & anxiety. i hate this fucking shit.
i went outside today after 6 months of not leaving my house.
it all started when i got an appointment to my therapist, but with two days before the appointment day my body and mind went crazy. started having panic attacks, couldn't eat or sleep and in the end i cancelled the appointment. that was the thing that made me say: fuck this, i need to do something - called one of my close friends, and we walked and talked for almost three hours. i still had awful sensations but not that intense compared with two years ago when i started having them. *sorry for misspeling, i'm not a native english speaker*edit: grammar l.e.: today i went to the mall, buyed myself some clothes and went to eat in a fast-food with my friends. i don't know what will be tomorrow, maybe i'm not gonna' leave my house for another 6 months, but today i felt like a human being again.
therapy requires money. and to get money you need a job, but you can't get a job because you have terrible anxiety. what do people with anxiety really do? they're in a position, it seems, where there isn't a way out. this seems like a dangerous place to be
i could easily see somebody in this position getting very angry and lashing out. i work coding jobs that don't require any contact with people in the real world. i barely make enough money to get by. if this job goes to shit, which is very likely btw, i could be homeless and screwed.oh yeah and there's the dreams that you get every night that increase anxiety and the reason why i'm posting on here is because i just woke up from one of them.but hey, i guess i just chose to be like this. that's what people would have you believe, anyway.
i know this may seem silly, but i just went to ihop! i have not left my house since july 17th! i just wanted to share this small victory with you guys!
i have panic disorder and agoraphobia. it got increasingly worse this past year, and july 17 i went on medical leave from my job. aside from 5 doctors/psychologists visits, i have not left my house once to go anywhere else. when i went to the doctors, i was driven, and i pulled my hoodie over my eyes. two weeks ago, i started not even being able to go down to check the mail. friday my psychologist told me it was time to go out. she said i was causing myself to get worse by being scared of the outside world. i get anxiety just from having delivery people come to my door. just the thought of going for a drive seemed like an impossibility.today i woke up anxious. even after i took my medication, i was on pins and needles. i was dreading every second that went by, knowing i was closer to our(my fiance and mines) 3pm departure time. we chose that time specifically so the restaurant would be nearly empty. at 3 o'clock i started stalling and coming up with reasons why i couldn't go. at 3:45 he pushed me out the door and all but dragged me to the car.the ride there was scary but i forced myself to just listen to his voice and not hide my eyes. i felt nauseous. when we pulled into the parking lot and he pulled me from the car, he hugged me and told me this will be fun and i am safe and he will protect me. we got inside the thankfully almost empty diner. our waiter was so nice. he put me at ease a lot. i just chose something without really reading the menu because i just wanted to get the hell out of there. my fiance held my hand and just made small talk, making me start to laugh. i was able to relax a bit and even ate my sandwich! i was anxious, but i didn't feel like i was going to pass out or cry. we left and made it home with almost no problems!i am very anxious now that i am home(wtf self) but i am so glad i went! it was not nearly as bad as i thought it would be! i wanted to share this victory with you guys. this subreddit lets me know that i'm not alone. you people mean a lot to me <3
i went to a hockey game alone.
i hate going out alone, i hate feeling like everyone is watching me, i hate feeling like i’m being judged.so it sucked when the person scanning my ticket that i’d bought in a moment of braveness two hours prior said “oh, you’re here alone?”it sucked when i had the seat squeezed between two groups of families.it sucked when i had to get up and someone made sad eyes at me.but i did it. i stayed the full game, i had fun, i don’t regret going.the little victories.
can stress and anxiety cause your body to feel constantly buzzy/nervous in the form of a internal tremor ?
just wondering as i have been suffering with this also relating to my everyday life even when i don't feel stressed out ? 
my anxiety has made me less feminine
i've always felt pretty girly.  at the beginning of college and prior, i was super preppy and loved dressing up, collecting makeup, doing my hair, etc.  as my anxiety worsened through college, i unconsciously stopped spending time on those things.  i'm realizing now that part of my anxiety is a fear of looking vain in any capacity.  to the point where i would be afraid to wear earrings or paint my nails or update my profile picture on facebook because it would seem like i was trying too hard or looking for attention.  upon reflection, thats a ridiculous way to live.  i'm literally afraid to express myself in any way because i'm afraid of??? imposing myself on other people?  being myself and finding out who might not like me?  the actual reasons aren't 100% clear to me yet, but i'm at least glad i've figured this part out.  upon recognizing this, i painted my nails, put on earrings, and updated my profile picture (to a picture with just me in it for the first time!!) all because i wanted to!  weird baby steps.  
people normally find me scary (all black, goth, angry looking) and someone asked me for directions today! most people cross the road when they see me coming. big accomplishment!

our anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, but only empties today of its strengths.

anyone feels like living is suffering?
i get spooked by everything. worry all the damn time. meds, therapy, nothing helps. it's just periods of overthinking and worrying about random things. every single day. 
american politics is really fucking with me, and it's making it hard to be around my family.
i live in north carolina.  i went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to gtfo.in high school, i took ap history and ap government and politics and fell in love with america's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  i was at barack obama's inauguration with my ap g&p class, and it was wonderful.  one of the most amazing things i've ever witnessed.but here's the thing...  i was ultra, ridiculously, lick-ann-coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  i had grown up in a trite republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of jesus.  my grandparents are also very conservative.  fox news was *always* on.things quickly began changing when i moved to raleigh for college.  more racial and religious diversity, time away from fox news, i discovered reddit...  and then some personal things happened, as well.  i started having mood swings regularly, i had my first panic attack, i developed epilepsy, i was frequently in the hospital, i had no money...  i got pregnant and had an abortion.all of this was very eye-opening.  i learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  it was easy to be politically conservative when i was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  but going through all of that changed my view completely.  suddenly, i saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  i understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications i was on at the time).now, though...  look at what is going on in the us.  every time i think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  it makes me so anxious.  my healthcare is going to be fucked with, i wouldn't be surprised if ada got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  i might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least i'm white...my parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  i've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from february-april.  every time i'm there, if the tv is on, it's on fox news.  if my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  it makes me pissed initially, but then i just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  does he think *i'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???he's even got a signed picture of trump and melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  even if i was still conservative, i would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.he asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  he'll loudly commentate on whatever story fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what i think.  if i didn't have the political background that i do, i would not know what to say.  however, i know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what i do.  it's never what i believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  i can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.**tl;dr:  american politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  my dad *loves* trump and watches fox news constantly, even when i'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that i vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.***edit:  you people who are insulting me and pming me for expressing how i feel need to get some hobbies.  if anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  i didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  i'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, i was just trying to talk to some people that i thought would understand.**but, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  because it's the same feeling.***final edit:  looks like the trolls have gotten off work and have nothing to do this friday night.  well, i do, so i'm done with this thread.  i've gotten what i needed from it.  no replies or pms related to this thread are going to be addressed.****i really don't care, do u?**
deleting instagram has helped my anxiety immensely.
a few weeks ago i was on instagram and feeling very stressed out and anxious for some reason and the quote from theodore roosevelt  “comparison is the thief of joy” came into my head. so on a whim i just decided to delete instagram and it was almost instantly i felt a relief. im still not quite sure what it was but it has definitely helped and i only reinstall it on saturdays for football updates. not saying this is a general thing that will help everyone but it’s definitely helped me.
shout out to parents that really try to understand anxiety when their kids get diagnosed with it
thanks for actually believing that we have a real disease, because you guys are out here saving lives with that mentality. rising above the toxic stigma around mental health is so important in helping young people that suffer through it. from a kid with parents that really tried their best when i was growing up, and helped me deal with and process my needs, thank you. 
when anxiety strikes... walk slower.
take a stroll around the house in slow motion. it really helps! just a tip guys and gals.
does anybody else feel like everybody hates them all the time?
for example, i went to a little get together with some strangers with my friend tonight. right as i was leaving, i felt like everybody was staring at me and waiting for me to leave so they could talk shit about how annoying and unbearable i was. maybe i’m right, maybe i’m wrong. but i notice myself doing this thing a lot where i just assume that i annoy everyone and i’m better off just being quiet so nobody has to put up with me. anybody else feel similar?
sometimes when my brain is actually quiet i'll notice, and think how nice it is. and think about how it would be if it was always quiet. then i think i can't believe i'm not thinking about (insert anxious thought). and nevermind back to normal.

if anyone feels like they don't have anyone to talk to or just need to vent to someone. please, please message me and i will respond asap. i know a big struggle of mine was having someone to talk to. so i have committed to being there for anyone who needs someone.

you ever feel ashamed of cancelling plans, so you just ghost?
i feel terrible about this. when i make plans with someone i’m usually excited but when the day and time come to actually show up i retreat into my bubble and go into full panic mode. it’s like i give myself excuses why i can’t/shouldn’t go. and i’m so ashamed to actually cancel i just ghost. i feel ashamed before and after. sometimes i think it’s easier to be alone all the time just so i don’t have to disappoint anyone.
anxiety is having a multitude of people scream at you to move a pile of burning tires and you're sitting there begging them to wait until the tires aren't on fire anymore.
but the tires are never not-on fire, and the people never stop demanding that you move them and moving them is the hardest thing to do and you end up completely burnt and in pain, but when you're done, the people bitch about how the tires aren't in the right place and the pile isn't right and so you need to do it again. so you move the whole burning mess again and then you're nothing but a pile of ashes and your friends think you hate them because you didn't want to show up to the bar as a pile in a dustpan and try to pretend that you're still vaguely shaped like a person.then the next day you wake up and people start in with why are you being so lazy? you're just sitting there like a pile of dust. :((i've been on a panic attack for 4 hours now, and it's not going anywhere and every time i ask people to give me a minute, they go full friday boss mode and start yelling about how it needs to get done immediately and i just want to go into a cave and sleep for an entire week.)edit: maybe not technically a 4 hour attack,  i don't really count 10-15 minute periods of normalcy an end to an attack in the beginning of another. call it a 4 hour chain attack if that is a better wording to describe it
i spend a lot of money on “treat yourself” days and i am so glad.
i’m single and not earning a lot of money. i’m not fortunate to have a partner or spouse where i live in a household with dual incomes. but i spend about 70-80 dollars a month getting manicures and another 72 dollars for monthly massages. i’ve been doing this for almost two years now and sure that may be a “waste” of money, but i’m so much better at managing my stress and anxiety, which i owe partly to these choices i think.  i feel so relaxed with the massages and getting my nails done just makes me feel pretty. i have shit skin so my nails always look nice to make up for it (in my eyes).  i probably should better learn to budget and cut back in some other areas so that i can save more and eventually buy a house (that’s my goal now) but for now i’m so happy i splurge on this stuff. also i’ve learned to not feel guilty about spending so much on these luxuries.  no good guilting myself for feeling good (ah the struggle of an anxious mind)
kid cudi checks himself into rehab
came across news this morning that hip hop celebrity kid cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. he wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned.just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety.here is the letter: its been difficult for me to find the words to what im about to share with you because i feel ashamed. ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting i’ve been living a lie. it took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something i have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans.yesterday i checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges.i am not at peace. i haven’t been since you’ve known me. if i didn’t come here, i wouldve done something to myself. i simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. idk what peace feels like. idk how to relax. my anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as i can remember and i never leave the house because of it. i cant make new friends because of it. i dont trust anyone because of it and im tired of being held back in my life. i deserve to have peace. i deserve to be happy and smiling. why not me? i guess i give so much of myself to others i forgot that i need to show myself some love too. i think i never really knew how. im scared, im sad, i feel like i let a lot of people down and again, im sorry. its time i fix me. im nervous but ima get through this.i wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at republic and my manager dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. the music videos, album release date etc. the album is still on the way. promise. i wanted to square away all the business before i got here so i could focus on my recovery.if all goes well ill be out in time for complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.love and light to everyone who has love for me and i am sorry if i let anyone down. i really am sorry. ill be back, stronger, better. reborn. i feel like shit, i feel so ashamed. im sorry.i love you,scott mescudi
i went to the movies alone tonight
for the first time in my life! i don't know what came over me. i just decided i was going to get up and go see a movie. i was not going to let my anxiety take over and control me. there was a moment i almost turned back but i said no! i'm so happy i went, death cure was amazing! i don't think i'll be afraid to go on my own again :) 
wish me luck! i’m going to the gym and i will be fierce
last many attempts, i hyperventilated once i walked inside. this time i will at least make it to one machine. i will make it because i am strong. i will achieve this because i am powerful. i can control my emotions and they will be my bitch. my husband will be right beside me supporting me in every way. he is proud of me. i can do this. i can do this. i can do this. posting this to help myself. edit: i did it! i sat in the car for a while to breath and have the courage to go inside. i went to a machine and my legs still feel like jello. they felt that way the entire time i was there so i switched to arms. thank y’all for the support. it truly made a difference. i hope y’all get over your fears as well. ugh. i’m still shaking. 
update: went to the first day of work and everything went well!!!
i was so terrified! yay!!!!
anxiety is not being able to enjoy anything because you’re worried about that thing in 3 weeks that will actually be way less awful than you imagined.

“mommy’s doing something weird.”
this just happened and i am still cracking up about it.  i’ve been trying to incorporate meditation into my day in order to help with my anxiety.  i hadn’t mentioned this to my husband, yet.  well, tonight, i went into our bedroom and shut the door so i could meditate for a bit while my ps4 updated.  i guess he came out of his battlefield v world long enough to notice i was missing, so he came into the bedroom and saw me cross-legged, eyes closed on the bed while a soothing voice talked me through the session on my phone.  i looked at him, smiled, and went right back into it without saying a word.  i heard him whisper to our dog, “come on, let’s go, mommy’s doing something weird.”  and he closed the door and went back to his game. i just found it so funny.  luckily the session was basically over at that point, because i’m not sure i would have been able to get back into the relaxed state i was in prior to him barging in.  just thought i’d share something light.  anxiety sucks, but i refuse to allow it to consume my life.  
high-functioning anxiety: having the fear of not being taken seriously because i seem completely normal.
i hardly tell anyone i have anxiety because i’m afraid i won’t be taken seriously. my friends would describe me as outgoing and personable, but i do well in social situations only because i’m terrified of people not liking me— it feels like everything i say and every action i do in front of people is calculated. with being “social” along with doing well in school, i’m afraid no one would ever take me seriously if i told them that my brain is always ruminating, i can’t sleep, i have nightmares every night, dealing with panic attacks, etc. does anyone deal with this? has anyone with more “higher-functioning” anxiety successfully explained this to someone who was doubtful?
getting nothing done today: ✔
fuck.
screw you, anxiety. i won.

today was one of the good days and i don't have anyone to share it with...
i drove in the carpool lane, i got stuck in bumper to bumper traffic for over an hour, i drove in the dark on the freeway and switched lanes, i went around slower people and didn't stay in the slow lane. i didn't spend the entire drive white knuckling or even have to spend the entire drive exit after exit telling myself just get to the next exit and then you can pull over. i didn't compensate for my panic by constantly changing the radio... i just fucking drove. what's even more  i did this all on the stretch of freeway i had my first full fledged panic attack on and i didn't even have to use my emergency medication.it's just one day and i know tomorrow could be shit but today i did a hell of a lot. the most i've ever done since i've started acknowledging and treating my anxiety.  to most people it's just driving like a normal human but for me it was huge. i am so proud of myself but don't have anyone to share it with but i thought this community might understand.&#x200b;i didn't end world hunger but for me, today was a damn good day.&#x200b;edit: gold?? i don't even know!
anyone else panic when the phone rings?

i made my first phone call in years !!!
i’m so embarrassed about the fact that i’m 22 and still rely on my mom to make my appointments for me. i just moved in with my boyfriend, a whole hour away from my mom. so i really feel like it’s time for me to start becoming an adult. i have a non-emergency surgery (wisdom teeth) coming up on tuesday, but i’ve been extremely sick the past couple days, so i really don’t think it’d be safe for me to be under anesthetic. i asked my mom for the number for the surgeons office, not realizing that it’s saturday and i would have to leave a voicemail. (i don’t even know what’s scarier, talking on the phone or leaving voicemails), but, thank god, they let you review/redo your voicemail before you send it. half an hour later, drenched in sweat, i recorded my 10th attempt and decide that that’s as good as it’s gonna get, and i sent it ! i actually almost sounded like an adult on it. but i couldn’t stop myself from over-explaining the situation. i’m proud of myself nonetheless, but i’m definitely gonna spend the next 2 days stressing about them calling me back/whether or not i’ll be able to get the surgery cancelled on such short notice. cheers to adulting 
does anyone else imagine someone is critiquing their music while listening alone?
whenever i listen to music i think is fairly fringe or unpopular, i imagine how people would react if they heard what i was listening to. it doesn't matter that i'm alone in my room, that possible scenario will bug me out so much i'll get sweaty and then that sweat will cause more sweat and anxiety, and i end up wasting time not listening to my song or making a shitty reddit post.
i'm hoping after i seek help for my gad that i can leave myself alone. do you guys know what i mean? any imperfection in my skin results in me making a mess off it with picking and pulling.  does anything help distract you from doing this, those of you with the same tendencies?

i cosplayed for the first time today.
i went on stage in front of about 200 people. i did a cute little dance for about 30 sec. i know it's not much, but i'm really proud of myself.a lot of people liked my cosplay and others asked if i wanted to take a picture with them! about 20 people! edit: thank you all so much for your kind words!! i read every comment and replied to almost all of them! ❤ you guys really made my day.
not sure if repost, but i feel that this sums up my irrational fears pretty well.

i can tell when my anxiety is high when i start making silly bets with myself.
sometimes i'll think i'm having a normal day when, almost without thinking, i'll crumple up the paper towel i've just used and say to myself, if i make this shot in the trash can it'll be okay., or if this red light turns green in the next 3 seconds then -insert random fear- won't happen. i'm wondering if i'm the only one that does this. i did it all the time when i was a kid and it still persists. it's one of the ways i  become aware of just how stressed out i am.edit: knowing that i'm not the only one who experiences this is very comforting!
anxiety sucks

i didn't get the job, but i'm proud of myself for trying
i got through two rounds of interviews and was told that i was a very close second, but that the person they finally went with had more experience. it was crazy hard to apply in the first place, it seemed physically painful to update my resume and write the cover letter. but i'm glad that i got this far. and i got over two hours worth of interview experience out of it as well. worst case scenario happened and i didn't get the job, and it's okay.
how i beat my anxiety disorder and advice on how to do so yourself
so if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying i know how you feel. i’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, i’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, i’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. i’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. i’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, i’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. and i’ve felt like i was going crazy. a lot.but i’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; i’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. i was also on medication (an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year. if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.i don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. if you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books i left in the second section. i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.before you read, i want to mention something once so i don’t have to later on. recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. it’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. but even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.so here it is. my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.if you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:at this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have gad and are constantly anxious. i was diagnosed with gad and pure-o but i’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so i know this advice will work for both.**1.** stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy (act) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. to do this:* don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. this is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes, i kept trying to consciously stop them. this was actually making things worse. the more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * questions, doubts, and fear will come up. when they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. it may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.* if this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. as the dare response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. if you’ve ever read a book on act, this step is likely in there. when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. in case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” it’s not discussed very often, but i found it to be very helpful. **2.** do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. in older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in the dare response, barry mcdonagh calls it being “engaged.” this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** again, much easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. but it’s an integral part of recovery. when i first started out, i found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** give it time. your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.**4.** if recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. when i took my first dose of valium, i didn’t feel a thing. it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but i will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. but since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.**5.** journal. i don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as i’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad, i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through. just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. it’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.**6.** get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. you don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.**7.** this one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. it’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. if you’re lying down, lay on your back. if you’re sitting, sit up straight.once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:if you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. but you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. so here’s what to do at this stage:**1. start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. the more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. in the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. when you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. in fact, i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on audible, which is how i consumed them):* the dare response. phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. his techniques are a combination between act and a little cbt. i would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.* feeling good: the new mood therapy. this book is considered the gold standard of cbt. it’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. i listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters i thought applied to me. it’s long, so i don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.* rewire your anxious brain. this one is 1/4 cbt, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. i like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.* the subtle art of not giving a fuck. this one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and i really like it. it serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. fair warning: mark manson describes ocd as “an incurable disease” in this book. he’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so i’d take that section with a grain of salt. but the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.**2.** get into therapy. this is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:* are they nice? kind of an obvious one but worth going over. do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?* are they experienced? my first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. * are they accessible? or do you have to drive two hours to see them? are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?it may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. i would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. **3.** continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. these are things that i remind myself of even now. the more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. in addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. if you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. if you’re down to two a day, try one.**4.** start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:* cardiovascular exercise. it’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but i’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. when you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. if you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. so getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. if you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. you don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. more on this later.* meditation. the reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. it also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. in fact, it’s almost the opposite. while meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. a really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. there is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so i won’t go into it that much here. make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. i suggest trying out the meditation app calm.* diet. if you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but i’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. one of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. it is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. you can also take a magnesium supplement (i’ll defer to the dare response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. * medication. this one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. i didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. this is a really important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. medication only makes it happen more quickly.**5.** give it time. your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. it may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. so just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.hovering around 4 - 6:if you’re at this stage, congratulations! the first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. so give yourself a pat on the back. once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. you may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. you’ve started reclaiming your normal life. you get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. but you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. in addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. so here’s what you should do at this stage:**1.** keep staying the course. it’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. but remember to pick up right where you left off. also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. and it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.**2.** keep pushing the envelope. identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. i used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since i was a little kid. i’d find flaws in every interaction i had with others and nitpick every little thing. once i started working on this, i noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. this is part of how exposure and response prevention (erp) therapy works. you expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use cbt techniques to curb your conscious worry. an important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. if you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. people around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. but you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.**3.** along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. when you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. the only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. i saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “i’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t i seeing my anxiety improve?” and the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. if you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.**4.** start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. for a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. it’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. one of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. i stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. if you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. i spent my entire college career going to different doctors (i think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). i was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. if you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. you can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (i personally used the cbt method outlined in feeling good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. **5.** give it time. i’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. and remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.i think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as i think understanding it will be really helpful. google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, i’ll give my own definition. cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. in other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. one example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. you might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think i’m a loser.” in this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying i did was for nothing. a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.at this stage, i had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, i always second guessed my own sanity, i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime i was happy, i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: i thought i was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that i really was. if you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them. at this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. i suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. i find that at this point the really important thing really is time. once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time, i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. this stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once i did, i hit the next stage.anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:you’re in the home stretch. this is it. you’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. for me, having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldn't have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder. certainly not anything i’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. and on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. at this stage:**1.** you know what works best for you. keep doing it. you have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. all that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** slowly lose your crutches. if you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. if you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. the more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.**3.** keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. for me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. the more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.there really isn’t much left to say at this stage. i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there. in case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.then finally…no anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:that’s it. all the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. all those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. it’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. you know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.i don’t have any advice for this point. you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. congratulations. you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. remember this feeling._my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. if it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. if it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. if it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. if it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. if it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **summary:****ease into your symptoms. remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. you’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.****don’t fight it. when you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.****keep yourself occupied. the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.****keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. expose yourself to more anxiety. exercise harder. try things you’ve never tried before. make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.****regularly question your thoughts. just because you think something doesn’t make it true. you’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.****give it time. you’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**thank you for reading this. i really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something

does anyone also hate nearly everything they’ve ever said?
the majority of things that have come out of my mouth, i regret saying. when i think about them, i feel gross and stupid. deep down i think i know that nobody else cares or notices or feels the same way as i do, but it doesn’t really help to know that. i feel like i talk too much and ramble much like i’m doing now and include unnecessary details.also, i spend a large amount of my alone time imagining conversations that will never happen and situations that will never occur. i say to myself, “from now on i’m not going to say anything that makes me feel stupid.” but that lasts like 5 minutes. i don’t really like myself and i have to pause and think before i say anything, but then i’m not sure if i’m acting like a human or some kind of robot.i will almost definitely regret posting this.
having anxiety and depression simultaneously is somehow caring too much and too little about things at the same time
i can't stop thinking about this. it doesn't seem logical, but i know many people, including myself, can confirm that it's very real.just a thought i wanted to get off my chest.
anyone else who day dreams of living freely on a tropical island with no technology at all?

that feeling in your chest when your phone rings
i hate it!
i had a good day today :)
i took a walk today when the weather was nice and didn’t look at my phone once nor did i allow anyone to rain on my parade today. i need more days like this. 
does anyone else get anxious when they realize they’re not anxious?

literally anyone: “just calm down!”
my anxiety: “f**k you!”“i aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin’t havin’ that sh*t!”
i drew a picture of all the difficult things i’m juggling right now. for all of you also juggling things, keep on juggling!

i practised being late this morning. no catastrophes resulted.
like a lot of people here, being late ramps my anxiety up to 11. this morning i woke up a little later than i would have wanted. i've been sick this week and my sleep has been a bit off.i hate being late but i also hate feeling rushed, so in order to get to my 9:15 am weaving workshop, i wake up every tuesday morning at 6:00 am. it gives me plenty of time to get up, get showered and dressed, and pack the part of my lunch that wasnt packed the night before--all at a leisurely pace.but today i woke up at 7:00. i was faced with a choice: rush, or be late. now, usually when i face that choice, i pick the secret third option and call in absent. but i've missed a lot of workshops lately due to things like appointments, and i knew the longer i was away, the harder it would be to come back, because my brain goblins were already saying things like you've missed so many sessions, they're going to kick you out of the program. they won't but they also expect you to attend, because space in the program is limited, so my goblins have a bit of grey area to work with.knowing that the workshop is a safe space, and knowing that i'd get a talking to (which i've never gotten so far) before they ever dropped me from the program, i chose to instead of rush, to be late. i treated it like an experiment: let's see if i can arrive late to the workshop without completely freaking out.i moved steadily, but not frantically, through my morning, and i left home about 15 minutes later than i normally would have. i discovered that i don't much care for the subway 15 minutes later than i usually take it, but otherwise, it was fine. i made my way into the workshop 15 minutes late, and completely without incident. one of the other crafters waved, and it was at least 5 minutes after i set up my loom that my instructor even stopped chatting with another crafter to see how i was doing. my lateness was a non-event.tl;dr: i chose to be late to my workshop today, and the sky did not fall, nor did my heart explode in my chest. go me!
the irony of anxiety disorders
- feel anxious about life - recognize that many people are going  through much worse- instantly feel anxious about that too
does anyone else ever feel “numb” or detached?
this week i have felt really weird and just off. i feel like i’m in a daze or dream. like i’m emotionally numb and just a zombie. not really wanting to chat or socialize or show any emotions really. just feeling meh. i was quiet at work and my coworkers seemed to notice. i didn’t feel like being part of the group. i did my work on auto pilot. i have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and take an ssri daily for the past 10-15 years. i have had depressive episodes in the past.anyone else experienced this?
9 hacks to get a handle on your anxiety right now
anxiety hack #1: get up and move your body!it’s pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you’re engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. this hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it’ll prevent the anxiety from escalating. choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the “cotton-eyed joe.” i dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin d. anxiety hack #2: breathe.one of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by dr. andrew weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) here’s how you do it:find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.hold that breath for 7 counts.exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. don’t forget the annoying “whoooooooshhhhh!” it’s key. ;)do this at least four times.anxiety hack #3: repeat affirmations.saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. the following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when i’ve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. “i am okay.”“i’ve been here before. this too shall pass.”“i am more than my anxiety.”“i will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.”“i breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.”“i breathe out fear and breathe in love.”“i will overcome this like i always do. i am getting stronger and stronger.”“i am safe within myself. there is nothing to fear.”“my body is filled with loving and calming energy.”anxiety hack #4: write it out.journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. if you don’t have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. whether it’s a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. trust me, you will feel some tension lift.anxiety hack #5: listen to feel good music.music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. the key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that’s not the type of music in your spotify library. choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by kygo, sam feldt, or bonobo.anxiety hack #6: get in touch with your spiritual side.connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. my favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). anxiety hack #7: show yourself some tender love and self-care.there’s nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. when you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say “that’s enough!” and go treat your poor body like royalty. get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.anxiety hack #8: love your anxiety.yes, you read that right. one of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. if there’s one thing you take away from reading this article, i hope it’s this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. they are just the best solution you have come up with so far.what if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to “fix”, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? what if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? what if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?the thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. which brings me to the last hack…anxiety hack #9: listen to and get acquainted with your body.if you’re experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they’re coming from, it’s time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. if you’re consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. chances are, you won’t go back and if you do, you’ll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. make sure you know what’s going on inside your body. knowledge about your body’s natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. once you’re more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. you’ll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. your intuition becomes clearer and you’ll be able to tell the difference between “good vibes” and “bad vibes”...and act accordingly.
does posting to reddit make anyone else anxious?
i recently posted to r/depression, and after posting i felt like my chest was being pushed in and really wanted to just delete the thing. does this happen to anyone else?
i went to my appointment!
i went to the doctors appointment id been dreading for weeks, and i didnt die! i think i was mainly so anxious because i knew she was going to recommend getting bloodwork done, but i still went and i made it through the appointment.edit: thank you all so much for the incredible support and encouragement!!!
hey people i think im overcoming anxiety day by day.
i actually didn't know it was possible but i'm literaly not nervous now when talking to people or being in crowd, pretty comfortable when people look at me.i started working in retail i think that really helped me.. just wanted to say this
i can’t even work up the courage to post on reddit.
i have had a reddit account for over a year.  when i post things, i usually take them down within 10 minutes. the small amount of comments i have made have all been posted while i was drunk. does anyone else feel this?
finally after 8 years of severe anxiety and daily panic attacks i have finally got to the point where i no longer take daily medication, and am basically ‘cured’.
i (26 m) am by no means saying that i still don’t feel anxious now and then but i have definitely regained control of my life. i am now living the life that i want to live. no longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life i want to.i am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where i am today i no for a fact that i am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where i am.taking time to heal: 1 year ago i made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time i need to push myself out  of my comfort zone and focus on myself. consistently exercising and eating better: i had no self confidence and was always exhausted so i used to eat junk food most nights just because i felt like shit and the food made me feel worse,  now i eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks stopped smoking especially cannabis, i still treat myself of a weekend to what ever i want but for the most part i plan my meals in advance and make sure i eat them throughout the week. and the benefits of exercise are well documented but could not be underestimated.sleep: this was harder than you might think for me and i massively underestimated its value, i have never been a good sleeper usually getting anywhere from 2/5 hours sleep a night was not uncommon, but after a lot of self experimenting what works best for me i have finally got it under control i am now getting between 7/8 hours a night and the difference is chalk and cheese, when you wake up refreshed from a nights sleep there is no better feeling. took a break from ‘soical media’: i deleted all social media accounts (except reddit) and to be honest i have not got them back and i don’t think i will, people portray an image of themselves to the world that they want them to see not their real selves, and it can make you compare yourself to other people which in my opinion is not healthy, focus on yourself. perseverance: not everything you try is going to succeed, over these 8 years i have tried and failed more timed than i could ever count, but i always try again the next day, small victories are the key, i would push myself every day to do something i was uncomfortable doing, some days i would fail but i would try again until i could complete what i had set out to do then more. take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying i can not remember where i heard it but it goes ‘ no man is your friend, no man is your enemy, every man is your teacher’, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what i did i did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack’s and see what they knew about it that i didn’t.i am not writing this to gloat i am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‘normal’ i am living proof that there is, better days are ahead. i hope anyone reading this might find it usually or insightful and if you have any questions leave them below and i will try my best to answer as best as i can. 
i have made a subreddit dedicated to providing people comfort after having a bad dream. i have stress related bad dreams almost daily which is a product of my anxiety. check it out if that's something that you suffer from too.

does anyone else get angry when they're anxious?
i've noticed it a lot of here lately. when i'm feeling anxious, little things seem to get to me more and make me agitated, which can then lead to me becoming fully angry. and then it's just a shit show because people i love think i hate them, when i don't at all. it's just shit they do makes me anxious sometimes. it's a whole frustrating cycle. edit:: oh, shit. i didn't expect this many people to reply at all haha. well, at least we all know we're not alone now. ❤️
i’m finally going to get help for the first time in years. i made myself a appointment to the doctors and i’m going to finally talk and seek some help.

i finally finished all my homework without crying
almost every time i do homwork i end up getting frustrated and start crying. so most of the time i would just avoid homework out of the fear of getting overwhelmed. but i've finally managed to get through everything, and keeping myself together. and i really feel satisfied.
just showed my driving anxiety who's boss by driving 140 mi roundtrip today!
so, i get really nervous when i drive. anxiety disorder, plus almosy getting into a wreck once has shaken me up. i normally only drive within my city limits with the farthest i go being to see my family 18 mi away. well, my step cousin invited me to her friendsgiving 70 mi away and i did it! alone! yes i was scared but i put on some classic rock and badly sung along in my car. it helped my anxiety a lot. plus i had a good time at the dinner :)only thing that shook me up was i parked too close to a guys pickup truck and he was pissed. i said sorry and moved it but he was still huffy. like dude i apologized and moved my car, what else do you want? anyways, i really think this has improved my driving confidence. to any of you reading this with driving anxiety hang in there! take it slow and steady.
please don’t send messages to people promoting whatever company you’re with in response to posting on here
i feel like promoting cbd companies, paid support groups, and apps to buy when someone posts about anxiety is not righti got a bunch of direct messages and chats about stuff like that after posting about my anxiety. i deleted my post because of it and i don’t think i’ll be posting againi just thought i’d share that
it’s overwhelming how members in this group help and support each other, this is just crazy, happy to be in this group

does anyone else have extremely tense shoulders?
i was telling my friend about how i had a sore neck (which i get pretty frequently because i sleep weirdly) and she reached over to feel it and was **shook** at how rock hard my shoulder muscles were. does anyone else have this problem? and are there any ways to relieve it? i do get massages now and then and i always specify that my shoulders are my problem area but it honestly hurts so much when they try to work on them like almost unbearably painful that i leave with my shoulders still tense af. any help would be greatly appreciated!
does anyone else get torn between wearing a really nice outfit and wearing something that won't bring much attention?
i have a lot of good dresses and tops that i know look nice but i'm always worried about it attracting too much attention, or people thinking i'm weird for overdressing or something, and end up just putting on a sweater or something again. does anyone else always go through this whenever they go out?
anyone else feel more confident in certain clothes than others?
like for example i feel great if i’m wearing shorts and a t shirt but say if i’m wearing like loads of layers and my trousers are too tight i feel a lot more anxious. i just like having freedom of movement i guess. what are your confident clothes?
anyone else experience getting butterflies throughout the day with no apparent reason?
it usually feels like i have to grasp for air after my stomach drops a little triggers vary: thinking about going out with friends , thinking about school or work load, something i'm nervous for... even just sitting there without necessarily having to think about anything in particular
does anyone else’s anxiety make them feeling like they have a fever?
whenever my “episodes” start i feel really really hot, like i have a fever. and this includes my head becoming really hot and my back feeling kinda like it’s burning up. i’m a little worried about it and was wondering if it is a common symptom or if it’s something to worry about.
lately i’ve been putting off sleeping because i’m so anxious for the next day
for some reason i get so anxious about every little thing that could go wrong so i postpone sleeping until my eyes can’t stay open, then i have to wake up 6 hours later for school. i have nothing to be anxious about but i guess i subconsciously want today to last longer so tomorrow won’t be as sudden. does anyone have any techniques for going to sleep early even if i think i’m not tired?
do any of you pace around when the anxiety gets bad?
when i get really anxious i pace around my house really fast and talk to myself out loud.  is that normal? 
i love the holidays because everything is closed. you can’t go anywhere, you can’t pay any bills, you don’t have to make any plans, it would be awkward to call anyone. true relaxation and relief of pressure.
cheers to how you enjoy your day, friends!
depression makes want to kill myself, while anxiety makes terrified of dying

fear of growing up and getting a real job
i'm 26 and i'm still working shitty waiter/bartending jobs. i know i should be done with school and working a real adult job, but for some reason, i'm kinda scared to grow up. i don't know why i'm like this. i hate my current job and my life. i wish i could just focus well in school and get my shit together, but for some reason i can't. like i feel like i'm too dumb to get my shit together. i've been in and out of school for 8 years now and i'm still behind in my classes. i just want to be able to figure out what i want to do in life and have that drive to go after it. i'm tired of working with teens and druggy adults.&#x200b;edit: wowowow thanks for the silver and all the replies guys! hopefully we can all get through this hellish life
weekly therapist visits and since july: $1,774. money spent on self help books, medicine, and other things for self care: about $500 finding what “sparks joy” and getting to know myself: priceless

i made a phone call
i am!!! so happy!!! i usually like...really hate making phone calls to make appointments or order things because i freak out and people are scary and im just all uugu mom can you do it, but i had to cancel my sat and after like 2 hours i got my self to pick up the phone and call them and! i *did* it. i was calm but shakey and i didnt cry and ohmygod i cant believe i made a fucking phone call without crying and its actually done !!!! its dumb that i, a 17 year old can barely make a phone call, but i am so proud of myself for actually doing it!!!!
a friend said to me, hey, dude, i think that's just your anxiety talking.
he's the first person to say something like this to me. while i know that my brain won't revert back to that sentence once i'm having a panic attack, it made me feel normal for a split second. like, yeah, you're right, that is just my anxiety talking, how i've been interpreting these situations is all false. hopefully, i can make this a daily mantra as a reminder that my brain is trying to ruin every scenario and then maybe one day i won't take the made-up scenarios of fear as truth. maybe.  thanks, marc. you the man.
am i the only one who starts to pace around a room or start trying to clean something when someone is yelling. or is it just me?

anyone else feel like they are waiting?
not waiting for anything particular, just a bored feeling i guess.  like i spend all day at work waiting for the end of the day, i do art and feel bored, waiting until i've done enough to call it a day.  i wait until my workout is over.  i wait until i'm finally done my meal.  i feel like i'm constantly bored, and anxiously awaiting the next thing to start, then waiting for it to end so the next thing can start again.and like, i'm not waiting calmly.  i feel antsy, and hold my breathe.  i feel like i cant wait anymore.  i just want to get up and run away, and also lay in bed and sleep all day.i sometimes feel like i'm just going through the motions, waiting to die.  anticipating it.what am i feeling?  what can help me feel content with my life and invested in what i'm doing?anyone with any experience like this?edit:i am now on lexapro and concerta and feel much better.
anyone else freak out over the smallest pain or symptom in your body?
i always make the mistake of googling which leads to days of worrying and just making the situation (and my anxiety) worse. just wondering if there were any others out there...currently i have a sore neck and shoulder--probably due to the week of hiking i just did-- but instead of being rational, i'm worried about all sorts of other diseases and illnesses
me irl

i signed up with university disability services because of my anxiety, and now i feel weirdly unworthy of the accommodations they offerin comparison do those with more limiting disabilities.
basically, it allows me to take my exams in a separate area and have some extra time. it makes me feel like i don’t deserve to be here, which blows because i worked hard to get here. i feel like i’m also screwing the other students because anxiety exists in everyone, just in varying degrees. to be fair i was evaluated, which is what enabled me to have these accommodations, but i just feel weird about it. has anyone else felt like this before?
i did it!!! i went out to dinner and didn’t get any anxiety! first time i’ve had a genuine smile in 2 years
i’m so happy right now, i got through the dinner, no panic attacks. this is such a big step for me, and i was so nervous to go, i thought i’d have a panic attack and throw up. the anxiety disappeared when i got there, i was so distracted i forgot i had anxiety, please guys challenge the anxiety, dont give in, i did it for so long and it didn’t help. leave your comfort zone for a bit, get out there, have fun! you’ll feel so accomplished
i drove today - big win!!
i just wanted to share with someone my big victory of the day (month and even year). it's been 5 years since i drove a car, because i was terrified of doing it. (btw, i have generalized anxiety disorder so it was feeding my fear) i have done and passed my driver's license 5 years ago but after that, didn't drive since then. today, i was tired of not being able to be independent because i can't make myself drive. i told my so that i wanted to drive in a really quiet neighborhood near our home. he drove there and after i took the driver's place. i was so scared. i thought i was going to crash or make an accident. i did it anyway. my so was patient and gave me tips. i parked. he then asked me if i was up to the task of drive back home. to do so i had to go on a main road and a boulevard with a bunch of cars, poeple and construction. i hesitated but said fuck it and did it. i did it guys. i was scared and nervous all the way home. but i did it. i'm proud of myself and i'm even a little excited (and scared) to do it again. best luck for everyone out there.***edit***wow! i wanted to thank you all for the amazing support i've been receiving on this post. you're all really sweet to have taken the time to write replies filled with hope, joy and encouragement. if anyone is curious, i drove again today because i didn't want to take the chance of letting anxiety get the best of me again if i would've waited to go back. i was less nervous and did even more different maneuvers (not the freeway though. not  yet). for the people wondering what i did do make myself drive again. i know it will sound really simple but after 5 years of putting off, i had this impulse of juste doing it. not because i wanted it but because i was tired of not being able to go where i wanted to go or applying to jobs i wanted because i couldn't drive. i had this impulse and knew that if i let myself think to much i would have hesitated. i would have convinced myself of not going. i didn't think. i just said to my so, ok! we are going! haha. he was a little confused but proud. to ease my anxiety, i wanted to start small with some tasks i was less anxious about (driving in a calm neighborhood). that made me feel a little less anxious and even create a positive feeling that i could associate with driving. because i started small, i was able to perceive a little bit of competence. also, i was anxious of going back driving again. but again, on an impulse that i listened, i went driving again today. a little bit like exposure therapy (as a lot of you in the comments said : practice reduce anxiety!)i really hope for all of you who struggle (as i am still) to be compassionate towards yourself. even if you're not there yet, be patient with yourself and when you're ready you'll push yourself a little bit. baby steps people <3

anyone else get driving anxiety?
is this common or is it just me? anytime i've got to drive somewhere i haven't gone before or where i don't know the roads well i get so nervous that i'm going to go in the wrong lane or do a wrong move and then get lost, get a speeding fine, or even cause an accident. i get especially panicky when i'm on a roundabout or where ther's a section of road with multiple lanes and i've got to take the right turn off or get in the right lane. i'm starting a new job soon and i'm dreading the first journey there. i feel so stupid for feeling like this, that i can't talk to anyone about it in case they think i'm an idiot.
i just hope everyone has the best day they can today!
my anxiety has been sky rocketing lately. i’m on night shifts and i think it’s messing with my mentality a bit (lack of sun, lack of human interaction, etc). so i know how it feels to have a realllllly bad day of anxiety! and i hope if youre dealing with anything like that, you cope well and make it through because (as we all know) it does get better it isnt a permanent feeling.love you all. xx 
anyone else overthink before posting to social media and therefore, never post at all?
i feel like i have nothing cool to post about, even if i want to share an accomplishment or a random thought. anyone else do this?
when anxiety makes me stay up late but depression just wants to sleep so then i'm anxious about not sleeping and then take 4 hour depression naps during the day to make up for it

ate in a restaurant alone for the first time. win!
this may be small for some but for me it's been a big thing.i've never wanted to eat alone. i always worried about it and thinking id be laughed at or looked at funny.but today i was out and wanted a nandos. so i went. i got seated and i've ate my meal. alone. it's a really great feeling. i'm beating this anxiety more and more each day. and i can't wait till it doesn't stop me doing anything and i can be more confident. just wanted to share to show others that it's possible to beat this shit. no one looked at me funny. no one said anything. it's been great. 
anyone else get anxious when receiving good news, because clearly this ain’t real and the shits about to hit the fan?
almost any time i get good news my brain immediately tries to find a way to ruin it. either by discrediting it, imagining ways it could go wrong, or assuming it’s not actually real. the other day i got an email saying that i won an award and i immediately assumed they sent the email to the wrong person. then when i found out it was actually intended for me i got that weird anxiety where i start shaking and i feel like i need to pee cry and throw up at the same time. i still have only told like 3 people because i’m certain if i tell anyone they’ll ruin it somehow. i think i’m more comfortable with failure tbh.
i am on lexapro and it feels like i started a new life.
i'm only a month in, but lexapro changed my life forever. i am barely anxious now, except for those situations that is normal to feel anxious. before meds, i was always worried i would fail a test but get an a, i would be the jealous boyfriend that saw every guy as a threat and i would obsessively think about what someone said for 3 days straight. my therapist even said some of the things i said we're ridiculous!i feel forever changed. my relationship has never felt more stable, and we are about to make a year. managing study time has never been easier. before it was either anxiety not letting me study, or my add. now, i just worry about add :pi am so happy. sometimes i feel like crying because of how much more stable i am. i feel *normal.* i still need to work on the shame about taking medication, but quite frankly, after being in therapy for at least 4 years straight, attempts to improve myself, nothing has worked, but lexapro has. thank you for coming to my ted talk
suicidal ideation is like an annoying brother you have to bring along on errands
can we kill ourselves?no.please?no.come on, pleeeeease??we've got laundry in that would be rudewhat about now?we promised we'd take out the neighbor's dogs.and now?we're at work, that doesn't even make sense.come on!okay listen buddy, maybe if you're real good after work when we run errands, we can kill ourselves.even though you know you won't. and then you just try to tucker out little buddy so much that by the end of the day he's already asleep. if not, you tell him a story. it's just fantasy, but he doesn't know that. but unlike a little brother, you wake up every morning hoping he won't.
i just ordered food on the phone for the first time :d
i've always been terrified of talking on the phone, and especially ordering food.lately i've found it's easier to make phone calls in the car, so i've been doing that for a few months now for seeing up job interviews, doctor's appointments, etc. but today i ordered chinese food, in the kitchen, with someone else in the room. that's like all the worst conditions, and i did it :d
i am sure some of you can relate to this...

dae read messages they're about to send over and over again
i just sent an important message (about three paragraphs long) and i reread it around ~10 times before sending. i'd get to the end, and everything would sound alright, but i'd still need to go back and make sure. i don't know why i do this, but i have similar tendencies when it comes to checking if i locked a door or turned something off. does anyone else relate to this?
at my worst i feared the night, when the sun started going down my anxiety would go through the roof, i would beg the sun to stay up but it never did. a massive shout out to all those fighting your own battles. sending you love and hope.
my journey through anxiety took me on a massive emotional roller coaster.  i find myself in a better place now but ill never forget or ignore those still fighting to regain their lives.  sending you all the love and hope in the world.  you are not alone.  stay strong, believe in hope and humanity.  peace and  love to you all.  i'm here for you.
a small victory!
i saw a girl in public, she had purple hair. i told her i liked her hair, she thanked me, and we went on. i never talk to people i don't know. so just complimenting on her hair, made me feel happy!
does anyone else get a huge amount of anxiety when someone knocks on their front door randomly?
i don't know what it is but whether it's a package being delivered or someone i know, if i'm not expecting them i freak out and can't calm down for the rest of the day. am i alone in this?
followed the sidebar to my local clinic......nevermind

anyone else replay over and over in their head stupid things they've done? how do you get out of that funk?

a comic i made about how i've been feeling recently :(

success :d
i just went outside by myself for the first time in 6 weeks.my heart is racing but i did it.fuck you anxiety.edit: thank you guys. it means a lot more than you know. you've all really given my confidence a boost today. 
i'm kind of mean when i have anxiety
on those high anxiety days (like today) i just get so negative and easily irritated by everything. i don't even know how to stop.
today at therapy
my therapist said that i didn't need him anymore. he said that i've improved enough that we can go from bi-monthly sessions to an as needed basis. i'm so damn relieved! my anxiety was at an all time high just a few months ago. meds and therapy got me to where i am today. there is hope!
a trick i used during a panic attack that actually helped!
i once read that during a panic attack you should look around you and say out loud what you can see, feel, etc. my husband remembered this and just as i was spiraling into a full blown attack he said “tell me what you see” and i started saying it out loud “tree, red sign,” etc. within about 30 seconds to a minute i could feel my breathing becoming less erratic, my heart rate went down, and i was coming back to reality. it didn’t get rid of it completely but brought it down to a manageable level. very effective if you ever want to lessen the attack without taking klonopin or xanax. 
so i’m having brain surgery
my tongue has been completely numb and tingling and burning for 6 months. i’ve always had bad anxiety so i just brushed it off as an anxiety symptom. after seeing many doctors i finally figured out today that it isn’t an anxiety symptom and it’s actually an abnormality in my brain causing nerve damage to my tongue requiring the repositioning of a vessel in my brain. so now instead of graduating high school with all of my friends i will have to shave my head and have actual brain surgery, pretty terrifying.looks like all that worrying was actually warranted, always get your symptoms checked!  sending love to all my worriers just remember it can always be worse. 
what if people looked at physical ailments the way they look at anxiety and depression?

i'm agoraphobic and have a lot of anxiety riding in cars atm. today i got out of my city and rode to the next town over (15 mn drive) and i was okay! :-d

sertraline saved my life
i spent six months telling my doctor i wouldn't take my prescribed 50mg sertraline because i wanted to overcome my anxiety without pharmaceuticals. in the meantime i had become physically dependent on alcohol (couldn't leave the house unless drunk, agoraphobia sucks) and it wasn't until a medical detox i decided to try my prescribed sertraline. its been 8 weeks since i started sertraline and although in the first month i had completely lost my libido and had daily headaches i now have no side effects and can live a normal life again. in my worst days i had multiple panic attacks a day and decided i had nothing to live for so was going to drink myself to death. most of you won't read this far but i spent a lot of time googling peoples experience of ssri's which scared me from taking sertraline. im just trying to post a positive experience against all the negatives, i know everybody is different but i think ssri's have a bad reputation when for some people they are life changing. 
i just can’t handle the fact that one moment it’s saturday morning and next thing you know it’s sunday night, and you can’t do anything about it. i would do anything to be able to stop time.

i have days when i can clearly see how dumb my anxiety is, and then there's days when i'm sucker punched by the very thoughts i laughed at earlier.

update: two weeks with no panic attacks!!!
hello everyone!! i figured i’d update my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety/comments/cka6nf/a_week_with_no_panic_attacks/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)to say that i just reached two weeks with no panic attacks! after my original post, i did suffer from one about 3 days later and felt really depressed...but i picked myself up, and told myself that tomorrow is a new day to try again...and here i am 2 weeks later! this is the longest i’ve gone with no panic attacks in 6 months - so, if i can do it, you can too! my anxiety makes it very hard for me to eat...but i’ve eaten every day for two weeks and i feel so much healthier and stronger!!  i’m starting my (senior!!) year of college in a week and usually school is the biggest stressor for me...here’s hoping i can finish my degree panic attack free!
psa: don't yell at retail workers
please, for the love of god, don't yell at retail/fast food workers. you don't know what we've been through lately with work/personal lives. you're anger over silly issues that can easily be fixed is unnecessary, childish, and uncalled for. your entitlement and attitude may very well cause harm to those on the other end. tl;dr be nice to people you don't know who are trying to help. 
does anyone else hold their breath without realizing it when you're really anxious?

anxiety won today, and i stayed in bed till 7pm.
my so was gorgeous though - brought me toasted sandwiches and tea, and called my mum to come visit me. i'm wrapped up on the sofa watching tv now, and feel very loved, if a little battered my mind at the moment. edit: wow i had no idea so many people would comment or upvote haha. thank you all so much for your supportive and lovely messages - we've got an awesome community here that i feel very lucky to have available. xxxxxxxx
anyone ever feel like their personality is fading away?
it's like instead of spending the crucial years of your life figuring out who you are and how to relate to people you spent all that time anxious and having panic attacks. now you lack the skills to socialize and have an identity crisis. this is how i feel. even after treatment and pills i still feel lost. i feel like a shell of a person. a blank slate. someone who pretends to like what other people like for the moment in order to fit in. creating some sort of pseudo personality from bits and pieces of others' personalities just to get by.edit/update: whoa this blew up. it's really good to know i'm not alone.
freaking hot
does anyone else find their anxiety increases when they are really hot? i work in a very hot environment and when i'm at work i can barely keep it together.
i finally changed my facebook profile picture-despite anxiety about doing so!
hi all,so this probably sounds stupid, but i've had so much anxiety regarding changing my facebook profile picture, that i haven't changed it in 3 years.  i guess i've always been anxious about not getting likes and what people will think (i know it's ridiculous). but,  i finally just said screw the anxiety today and changed it to a nice one! it's a small step but i feel like i did something good for myself today. have a great day everyone!
anxiety girl

does anyone else just sometimes collapse and become a shell of a person for maybe weeks at a time?

fuck health anxiety
fuck it! im so fucking done with it. as soon as i feel anything in my body, especially with my heart area or finding a lump or bruise i just fucking lose it and get scared of dying. what if this chest pain is a heart attack, what if this lump is undiagnosed cancer. what if i let these things fester and get termanilly ill. or worse what if i die today, it feels like i have symptons of heart attack or failure right?just fuck it, fuck these thoughts and how believable they are. even with therapy it just feels so fucking impossible to overcome. i just want to live a normal fucking life and not this anxious mess im living in right now.
i got an internship!
can’t believe this is really happening. i’m nervous but excited. i’m really glad i conquered my anxiety and went through with both interviews. if you’re thinking of putting yourself out there for a job/internship/anything else, just go for it! you can do it! i honestly didn’t think anything would come of me applying here, but here i am a week and a half later with a paid internship!
more american teenagers than ever suffering from severe anxiety

welp i finally did it. took myself to the hospital for suicidal/violent thoughts. currently waiting to be seen
my anxiety has been building and building lately (as you can see from my post history). i've been getting depressed and have been thinking of suicide for weeks. last night the thoughts developed into hurting others, might be because of zoloft (been on it for 4 weeks). i always told myself if it got bad enough i'd go to the hospital so i decided that's it. currently sitting in the waiting room and they just took my vitals. i'm half relieved half scared shitless. it's pretty quite here so i'll be seen soon and i hope they aren't too hard on me. wish me luck everyone 
my cat knows when i’m having a panic attack and does her best to ground me and help me calm down during, even though she’s normally not affectionate in that way.
honey is a fat calico cat, she’s a little over five years old and i got her from the shelter at a few weeks old (she was trying to shove her head through the door of the cage). she’s my little baby; follows me everywhere, sleeps in my room when i’m there, and finds anywhere close but too close to sit to me. she’s not a touchy kind of cat, she has her moods but most of the time she just wants to be near me and not be touched or held. something you should know about her is that she loves kneading, but if you pet her while she’s doing it she’ll stop and probably move away.i woke up in the middle of the night  and started having a panic attack. almost immediately as i begin doing breathing exercises (that somehow weren’t working this time), she jumps onto the bed and sits right next to me, a few inches from touching me. she starts kneading my blanket and meowing at me, then she walks back and forth and around me, making sure she’s rubbing against me the entire time. the whole time she’s purring and occasionally meowing at me. i start petting her and talking to her, i start calming down because she’s now keeping me grounded in reality by rubbing on me like that and letting me pet her. she goes back to my side and continues to knead on my blanket while i pet her.she doesn’t move away when i keep petting her, even though she’s kneading. she’s purring louder than i usually hear her purr, but not meowing. until i start getting panicked again, even though i’m petting her. she meows like she’s bringing me back to reality. we do this for a while longer, then i lay back down in bed and continue doing breathing exercises, hoping to get back to sleep.she comes up and lays right next to my pillow (not a typical spot for her as she doesn’t appreciate being brushed against even on accident if she didn’t want pet), curls up, and gets in a position to sleep there with me. i gently put my arm so it’s touching her back (she’s really soft and it’s comforting), she glances at me before putting her head back down to sleep.it might be silly and sort of tiny, but it really amazes me how quickly she came to my rescue. granted, she’s gotten me through several attacks and it wouldn’t be hard for her to recognize the difference. this attack was more recent, but as i laid there touching her back i just thought about how sweet it is she at least seems to know when i’m having an attack and how to handle it as best she can.i’m so glad i have her as most of my panic attacks are in the middle of the night (1-3am usually), so i can’t talk to people i know would help me calm down because they’re asleep. my little helper is always here for me.i hope you all enjoyed this story, i just wanted to share how much my cat helps me calm down. :)edit: here she is! https://i.imgur.com/gtgqnmj.jpg
what do you guys do to help with next day anxiety?
for some odd reason, i can't truly relax after work because the fact that i have to work tomorrow makes me anxious. this has always happened whether its school or work or anything. any tips to make the anxiety shut up? :/edit: thank you so much guys, these are really helpful. feel free to keep tips flowing in for future readers to help them ♥️
i went to therapy!
after last year (a semester of depression and then then just crazy shit until the end of the year) i started this year out right. i went to a therapist. she was so nice and caring and non judge mental and helpful, we both lost track of time and talked for a long time. i’m super tired now but it’s a good feeling. 
my therapist had me try brainspotting on friday. holy shit.
i've had anxiety ever since i can remember. the past couple years it's gotten to a point where it was getting so bad that i was developing depression, ruining relationships with friends and family, not leaving my apartment, etc. it was causing a lot of strain on my relationship as well. so after years of saying i'd go see someone.. i finally started seeing someone about a month ago.last week she wanted to do a brainspotting session with me to see what kinds of mid-brain emotions and feelings we could uncover and release. and see how my anxiety manifests, and where, as we learn to identify my thoughts and find potential triggers.it was intense. i remember when she first explained it to me, i was skeptical. i didn't understand how that could possibly do me any good or even get a reaction. but it did.we did that for my entire session. i thought about memories i had long forgotten about. felt my arms get painfully hot, then go numb. my temple throbbed where i get migraines. i cried - a lot. i found it hard to swallow and breathe.and then with i'd say about 10 minutes left, i felt relief. not just from those things, but actual mental relief. i felt it leave through my fingertips. i smiled. i still was having thoughts of these people and events, but then went from being negative and hopeless to appreciative and grateful. my anxiety over the weekend was basically non-existant. i actaully made an effort to see friends. i felt energy. i felt like a literal weight was lifted off of my shoulders.i'm not sure anyone else has done this yet, or what their experience has been with it. but i'm interested to hear if you have. and i know it's a fairly new practice, but it's one i'm excited to explore further to see what else can be uncovered and hopefully let go of. 
one day, i just want to sit down, and know everything's going to be okay.

how i feel about every social interaction.

does anyone else feel very nervous about answering text messages?
i always say to myself i will answer later, after i think of something good to say, but i end up not texting back for days.its probably why i lost all of my friends. i was too nervous to speak to them and ended up not speaking to them at all
am i the only person who will do something socially embarrassing and have it play in their heads over and over again?
i’ve had the same scene playing in my heard over and over again since monday and i can’t get it out of my head. it’s gotten so bad to the point where i’ll stay awake until 2 am analyzing what i said.
does anybody else avoid speaking to friends because you worry that they might not reply because they secretly hate you?
i'm so frustrated with myself. i know i'm being irrational but i can't help the way i feel.in a few days my university classes are going to start again and i was unsure about a few things regarding the timetable. anyway, the obvious solution would lie in asking people who take the same classes, right?i had to force myself to text into a group chat with people that i'm friendly and never had a problem with. they're all nice and helpful. but since there were no classes, i didn't see them for a while. so when i attempted to text, i kept asking myself, 'what if they hate you, what if they only pretended to like you and they're annoyed by your questions, what if they don't reply and you're being too needy' etc.logically, i know that these worries make no sense because these people have never done anything to indicate that they might feel this way about me. so, like usually, i bullied (motivated?) myself  into texting anyway. when they didn't text back immidiately (which, hello, is totally understandable because they're not available 24/7) i kept working myself up.i'm so done with myself because, in my head, i know these worries are senseless and that i'm being ridiculous, but i still can't help myself.this problem extends into other parts of my life. i'd have to be in an extremely dire situation to ask for help from anyone, even from my best friends. i'm always worrying that i'm being a bother and that i'll be dumped for being too needy. do some of you experience similiar issues and have you found something that helps you cope?
i want this.

does anyone repeat tv shows or movies to sooth anxiety?
lately i've been watching star trek discovery... it's only got 2 seasons but ive rewatches both at least a dozen times all the way through... it's like my routine... while i'm at woke or when i wake up or at night i can't help but rewatch the same episodes i've already seen before....there's something soothing about watching something familiar over and over again.does anyone else do this? 
i spend so much energy coping with anxiety and suppressing anxious thoughts that i have no energy left to be in the moment or learn anything
i grew up performing music so i am able to handle stage fright pretty well. but it feels like i am adapting stage strategies to regular life situations, like i'm focused on performing the act of being a normal person, that i don't enjoy the event fully. whether it's a music concert or a date. later on i have to reflect back to evaluate if it was a good time or not. most of the time i just feel relief if i didn't mess up too bad, much like music performances. also i am doing a pretty rigorous educational program and i feel that my frequent anxious/negative thoughts and my subsequent coping mechansms are leaving little brain power left for me to learn. i'm retaining some information but it feels like i'm losing a lot at the same time.
does anyone else experience depression in the winter and anxiety in the summer?
since i was young, i've been prone to depression in the winter (possibly s.a.d) and anxiety in the summer. this might not necessarily be because of the weather, but maybe because the weather sort of triggers memories of difficult times before? when i was a teenager, i would become really reclusive during the summer holidays and my anxiety would spiral. lack of structure and daily routine doesn't suit me. now i'm a teacher and i've noticed my anxiety sky rocket in the lead up to summer break. i'm curious if other people experience something similar during a particular time of year?
yeah...basically 

panic attacks? don't drink caffeine or alcohol... and drink lots of water and add salt to your diet.
that includes cups of tea, coca-cola, lucozade and of course, energy drinks, soda, fizzy drinks. (camomile tea can be a good replacement though! has very little caffeine. also try green tea or getting hold of theanine apparently makes you feel alert but less jittery-thanks whoever told me that in the comments!) can buy it on amazon.alcohol stays in your system for ages and messes with your head, as well as gives you increased palpitations etc. can also develop into a bad coping mechanism where you drink more to stop the anxious feelings, but the next morning you wake up its ten times worse!water and salt- good for fighting off low blood pressure which a some people with anxiety may get, might be why sometimes you get dizziness, jelly legs, light-headedness etc. (**some people have high blood pressure from anxiety so staying off the salt and actually increasing caffeine can help- however i think the majority can benefit from less caffeine and alcohol and more water!) thanks for people mentioning that.** a few simple things to help reduce your anxiety massively. **p.s i'm not a doctor or nutrionist, just going from my own experience and from people's comments below! editing this whenever new advice appears.** probably a very obvious post for some, but not everyone knows and they make a huge difference!
hey everyone
just want you to know i hope you all have a good day and a peaceful one. the struggles will pass. we are ok. there are good things in this world.  i got your back out there today even if you can't see me. we're all on the same team and we're gonna win.
my daughter is incredible.
i hate crying in front of her. and i feel as though a lot of the time recently, i’ve been losing my temper with her or she asks “why are you crying mummy?” and wipes my tears away! she immediately knows why too, which is even sadder.i was just having a panic attack, or what felt like one. i couldn’t breathe. i couldn’t control my thoughts.i was just shaking and desperately trying to calm down. anxiety just got way too much. i’m having an extremely bad day, everything is going wrong. but she runs. grabs her favourite teddies, her blanket and surrounds me with her toys and lays the blanket on my legs. and just holds my arm to tight. she bought me down to earth again. she’s 5!i feel so guilty that she has to do those things for me. but i am so god damn proud of her heart.
tfw you want to seek professional help but calling to schedule an appointment gives you anxiety.

asked a woman out after four years...
{final update posted at bottom of post}welp. 2014 was the last time i had a date. i work at a very busy restaurant and usually abstain from, “shitting where i eat.” this time was different. they hired a new hostess and i was taken aback by her beauty and grace within the first thirty seconds i saw her on her first shift. i, the contemplative and patient type, waited two weeks to see if she would stick around and whatnot. i found out that one of my favorite female coworkers is her best friend! i had an in. i gathered up the courage with aid from an ‘askreddit’ post by a female i read years ago. eli5: instead of asking a woman “out”... ask her to get something specific to eat with you or do something specific with you instead. i.e. - “let me take you out to get pho tomorrow.” > “let’s go out on friday night.”i used the former example and it worked! she said yes immediately and said that i was speaking her language and that she couldn’t wait! she gave me her number shortly after. i’m severely out of the swing of things in terms of dating and found inspiration in this act tonight. i plan on taking her out tonight if she’s free. i really haven’t felt genuine happiness in years and wanted to vent / share with someone!  much like a lot of you, i’ve dealt with anxiety and depression throughout the years. so it’s nice to have a break and a light of hope shine through!part kismet - found out we live in the same apartment complex. weird. tl;dr - 2014 was the last time i had a date. have a new coworker who is graceful and gorgeous. i thought her out of my league. i asked her out with encouragement from a post i read on reddit years ago. used the advice and it worked! we have a date and i got her number. she said she can’t wait to go out. :)——————-update: she was working tonight. it will be a couple of days until we’re both free. thank you all for the support! it makes me happier with my decision and strengthens my love for you guys. i will keep y’all updated!——————-update p2: she and i are moving shifts around to meet up sometime this coming week. given the holidays, it will be a little tricky to nail down an exact date. i will let y’all know! btw i’ve been keeping it cool and not blowing her phone up or anything. we talked for about 20 minutes alone tonight just learning about each other. stay tuned!—————-update p3: it’s a date! next wednesday!___________date night! here we go! :)////////////results! 11/10we went on an amazing date with pho, bowling, and craft beer. we then met up with my best friend and some of his friends for board games! we got to know each other a lot. we have many similar interests! we talked about just honestly seeing each other and seeing if it turns into something. i was a “perfect gentlemen” and she said yes to a second date! put yourself out there. the results may surprise you! thank you all for the love and support. i’m happy :)
i finally called the dentist today.
calling people terrifies me and i finally called and set up an appointment for monday. i am so relieved. i've been trying to build up the courage quite literally all year. 
has anyone quit their job because of the stress and anxiety it caused?
so i've decided to resign from my job as it's causing me endless stress and anxiety. i've had anxiety for years and have been fighting with my job just as long. so this tue i will put in my two week notice. i'd rather leave earlier but in order to get paid for your leftover vacation time you have to give two weeks. i don't have another job lined up but have been working with a recruiter and have been applying to jobs.    my partner is definately not happy about it but i said i just can't take it anymore. my partner also is getting frustrated with my anxiety issues. has anyone else done this?  
does any one feel like that anxiety has crippled you to the point where you feel like you are stuck ?
i feel like life has passed me by. i haven't received my degree and i've settled with jobs. i am making much less than i need to survive because of my anxiety. i'm in my late 30's just stuck. anyone else dealing with this?
exposing my deepest fear to you all on the internet
hello reddit. i’m a 31 year old male, and since i was 14 i’ve been dealing with crushing anxiety and depression. most of my life i have carried this burden by myself, because i’m terrified to deal with the issue that i believe is causing it.i’ve at some points abused alcohol and weed to ease my pain, though this of course has only worsened my problems over time.as i am writing this, my hands begin tosweat, my heart rate increases, and i can feel the terror that has haunted me for so long coming to the surface, and it makes me want to retreat back under the rock i usually hide under. my problem is an intimate one, and a problem i dont know where it is proper to talk about. it’s my penis...i suppose you could call me a grower. in its normal state, my penis is very small. when it becomes erect, its medium size i think, so its not really that bad overall. in fact, i suppose it very practical, as its not in the way when i dont need it :) at least thats what i tell myself to get a giggle out of myself, and make myself feel better.my problem began when my first, and only girlfriend, put her hands down my pants, and said to my face something along the lines of «omg its so small». this completely destroyed me, and it was the last time i have ever been intimate with anyone. so yes, i’m now a 31 year old virgin who has never seen a woman naked outside of the internet. the reason i an writing this, is simply to force myself to put this information out there, so i have to deal with it, as i have never talked to anyone about this.keeping this to myself has destroyed every part of my life. it sent me into a spiral of pain, suffering, anger, and drug abuse. my friends obviously have noticed that i avoid parties, and any situation where i risk any form of intimacy.some of them think i’m gay, and now i cant even stand being around my own friends, as i cant even be honest with them about what is causing my behavior.if you’ve somehow read this entire post, i thank you. i needed to do this, to overcome my own fear of the humiliation that comes with it.already, i feel a little better than i did than when i started writing.thank you reddit. i wish you the best of luck in dealing with whatever issue is bothering youmuch love
finally. after 10 years of severe depression & anxiety i made an appointment. first therapy session is tomorrow. heeeelp.
i'm at a point in my life where i feel like i'm stuck in a deep black hole and without help i can't get out. the longer i wait, the more difficult it will be. yesterday i decided i can't go on like this. i had a sleepless night because i knew today is the day i will finally call for professional help. it felt like a giant rock has been lifted. and tomorrow is already the first session! i'm excited and afraid at the same time! i have so many issues going on that need to get cured, that i don't even know where to start. and at the same time i'm anxious if i don't know what to say? during the telephone call she asked me shortly why i decided to seek help. i nearly cried and stuttered it's because of many reasons, mostly because of depression and anxiety. i think she felt my desperation, that's why the appointment is tomorrow.guys, i need some advices. thank you.edit: just wow. i'm overwhelmed by your support. thank you! i'll try to answer one by one, but it will take a while!
sometimes want to shout at my brain shut the f*** up!
if it's not the intrusive thoughts, it's the constant chatter that won't stop. if it's not that, it's the on-going replaying of every social interaction over and over again, analysing them in great detail. if it's not that, it's the constant worry about what everyone's thinking about me. if it's not that, it's a selection of highlights from mess ups i have made many years ago. if it's not that, it's the intrusive thoughts...seriously, just shut up please!
i m on fire today. went to costco, picked my prescription, took lyft back talked to driver
talked to neighbors... holy wow
this usually helps me, so i decided to share.

i created a little anxiety kit for myself a couple weeks ago
i got the idea during my very first in-patient-stay at a psychiatric ward this summer, thinking that as a woman you always have your emergency period kit on you (at least i do) so i thought why not pack one for anxiety/panic attacks too?so far it includes:* headphones (i have some sos headspace meditations on my phone which help from time to time)* acute anxiety meds (which i have never used from this kit, but you'll never know...)* grapefruit essential oil and a couple swabs to put them on (don't worry, i'm not into oils *at all*. some nurse at the hospital suggested that to calm me down once and it sort of stuck. it doesn't really do much, but i associate the smell with something positive). does anyone else have an anxiety kit? any suggestions on what else to put in? love to hear your input.
does anyone else ever feel like cancelling/ignoring things you're actually excited for?
for example, i'm seeing my favorite band tonight and i've been looking forward to it all week. now, though, if i had a choice i would just not go at all. i'm thinking it's because of the butterflies and excitement/nervousness, and that i'm just tired of anticipating things (which usually causes anxiety)? this is like the 6th time i'm seeing them, so it's not even first-time nerves and i've never *not* wanted to go see them...but it's also been years since they've toured and my mental health wasn't as bad back then.it could also be because i've been at this music fest for the past two days and i'm exhausted from the crowds, idk.
does anyone else's anxiety die down for awhile?
i'll have period of weeks or maybe a month where my anxiety isn't as bad and i think hey maybe i'm finally overcoming this bullshit disorder but then out of nowhere i get constant palpitations, fear of death 24/7, random racing heartbeats, feelings of disconnection from reality, and a whole other slew of scary/uncomfortable body sensations that remind me it's still very much there. i'm not sure how normal this is, it's like it comes in terrifying waves and i hate it.
the irony of this subreddit
i always type out replies to a bunch of these posts wanting to help and then i start overthinking that they don't come across how i meant or i just feel stupid and delete them. you'd think in a community for people with anxiety that i wouldn't have anxiety about posting things
do you ever wonder how your life might be different if you dealt with you anxiety earlier?
i always wonder because i didn’t realize just how bad my anxiety was until college. my anxiety typically makes me super irritable and throughout high school i just attributed my irritability to hormones/angsty teen crap. once i realized i had an anxiety disorder i realized just how many anxiety attacks i had had over the years. i always feel dumb for not knowing or figuring it out, but i genuinely had no clue that what i was experiencing wasn’t normal.i think i pushed away a lot of people who could’ve been really good friends in high school simply because i would be ridiculous irritated and frustrated without warning and just snap at them. i don’t know how much i’d go back and change because i’m happy with where i’m at now. i just wonder how different my experience would be if i realized i had a problem at 15 or 16 rather than 20.
im typing this to make it look like i’m actually doing something (like writing a message?) so that i do not seem suspicious or like i’m standing around doing nothing like an anxious twit whilst waiting for my dad.
as the title says.edit: it’s over, thanks for the advice! 
the anxious person's guide to life (illustrated)

i was having a massive never-ending panic attack and called the suicide prevention hotline
today i was triggered and had a massive, and i mean catastrophic panic attack. i couldn’t calm down and for the first time in a very long time, my mind went to some really dark places about not wanting to be here anymore. desperate for someway to handle the panic, i called the national suicide prevention hotline just to talk to someone. i talked to a lovely gentleman and explained how i just needed to talk to someone to process and help me ride out these feelings. he listened and was very kind. i felt really odd just rambling and crying to a stranger, but it did ultimately help. my boyfriend came home a few minutes later and so i went to spend time with him. it still took a while to settle down, but i finally was able to. i just want to really advocate using this hotline if you need it. it can really help just to talk it out to a neutral third party who genuinely cares about you. you don’t need to feel ashamed or embarrassed of using this service. it is there for you. use all resources available to you. love to my other warriors ♥️here’s the number if anyone needs it: 1-800-273-8255
my hero, brian wilson just cancelled a concert i was going to due to mental illness and that’s ok.

a different kind of lonely
saw this elsewhere and it really resonated with me. does anyone else feel 'touch deprived?' & i'm not talking about touching in a sexual way but simple platonic gestures like hugs, having someone play with your hair, resting your head on someone's shoulders and so on..no one prepared me for how lonely being an adult can be. 
why do i feel tensed up and worried when everything is fucking fine? i constantly feel this shit shit shit i gotta hurry feeling even when there is nothing to do.
i don't procrastinate anymore i didn't miss a single deadline for half a decade and i passed every exam i took. i'm not late to my appointments anymore. i fixed all the mistakes i made in the past, but it still feels the same, the feeling of dread and guilt doesn't go away.i don't really get much satisfaction out of anything, i just want to get it done so i can do other things. movies take too long, why can't they speak faster? why is the music intro so long? when does it start? how many hours does this game take to finish, etc.just why?
to all people who have no answer on their posts
i saw a publication similar to mine a few days ago, but i still wanted to speak on one point. to all those who have no answer on their post, know that your emotions are worth like everyone else, but that it can be difficult to answer everyone (i speak for myself, it is perhaps not the case of all). if you are ever in distress, do not hesitate to write to people here or to re-post if you do not have other resources. all you have to say about how you feel is important, do not forget that.  i hope my point is clear, i find it sad to see many posts of people anxious with no response. i do not blame anyone tho. i will probably dont get answers, but im happy if even one person see that. take care of yourself.
kristen bell explains there is no shame in feeling anxiety & depression

finally took the time to create a piece to represent my anxiety! hope you guys enjoy it.

in a book i got...

dae have constant nausea because you are freaking out and freak out more because you feel sick which makes you feel more sick which makes you freak out even more?
i get this every time i try to eat, and every time i want to hang out with a friend. and just about anytime i go or do anything anywhere. i am always dizzy and nauseous, i want it to end.what am i supposed to do when breathing doesn't help those tight throat feelings that make me sick
when you stop wanting something because the caused stress and anxiety don’t seem worth it anymore
title basically. will delete this if no one can relate. basically i’ve really wanted something for ages, but every day it’s causing me more and more anxiety and i’m starting to doubt if it’s all worth it. can anyone relate? maybe someone’s been through this already? if so, what did you do? give up or push through? also i won’t go into detail but it’s career relatededit: i didn't think so many people would relate to this, thank you for sharing your experiences and for all the kind words, it's genuinely helped me put some stuff into perspective, but also made me aware of my lack of self care at times. if i didn't reply to your comment, do know i read all of them <3
anxiety is
anxiety is feeling so bad about yourself because you got left on read or open. you obviously need attention, so you keep sending things until they respond to relieve you. anxiety is staying up till 3am every single night because you can’t get that one thing out of your head that you did wrong today. it’s feeling like you need to do more to please others, but it will never be enough because you still feel like you did something wrong to them. you will never feel at peace. you will never feel like you did enough. you will never know that no one cares as much as you do.edit: not saying this is everyone’s anxiety, this is just one moment in time for me.
dae trigger anxiety simply because your brain was like hey remember you have anxiety?
i was chilling on my couch, sort of relaxed (which has been really hard this past week). then suddenly my brain was like wow! almost forgot that we usually have this sinking feeling in our chest! aahhh shit here we go again!anyone else feel this way? this is sort of just a rant. i definitely want to fix this shit.edit: wow! so much feedback overnight. thanks guys <3 being able to relate really helps me keep fighting. hope this helped some of you as well. we got this! :)
anyone else get scared to open their whatsapp/messages?
i don’t know what it is, but i always have my notifications off and it takes a lot of umph for me to check my messages... 
i will fight my anxiety, won't shy away from it ever fucking again! i gave him a name: bitch!
it's fucking over.i won't be person that shies away from anyone and everywhere.i won't be that person who walks down the street with his head looking down.i won't be that person who shies away from his own anxiety.i will fight - i will fight - i will fight, because my heart is greater than my brains.i will fucking cure myself, i will fucking cure my anxiety, i will fucking cure everything.i won't let anxiety stop me anymore! it can do everything but i won't fucking shy away once fucking fucking again! &#x200b;a war on my own anxiety. &#x200b;will continue.... 
the constant anxiety of past actions is fucking unbearable.
i’ve been so cringy and awkward to so many people it’s hard to keep count. everywhere i go now i feel like i’m the weird one because of all the awkward stuff people have seen me do before. every. single. fucking. day there’s always something i’ve done to cringe about. most people have one moment in their life that makes them cringe, but i have them about once a week, and they paralyse me with just sheer embarrassment and sadness. i know i’m not overreacting, because if i was someone else and witnessed the awkward shit i was doing, i’d think i was a fucking weirdo too. man i just hate myself so much. i’m unbelievably far from the person i want to be it’s almost unbearable. everyday i see confident people, it’s unbearable knowing that i’m not one of them.the realisation that you’re not the person you want to be is the hardest thing that can happen to someone. i’m completely stuck. i need help. 
never let someone tell you anxiety isn’t an illness. one year ago (while having constant anxiety attacks) vs. now (having no anxiety attacks)

tired of ‘dont worry so much. its all in your mind. stop overthinking’. anyone feel me?

climate change anxiety anyone?
the articles keep coming out about the world ending in 30 years and i keep getting so stressed. i’m 24, good job, husband i adore but no kids. i almost don’t want to have kids if the world might end before they can live a good, full life. then i worry about all of our quality of life by then. i feel so crazy and anxious about this. is anyone else anxious about climate change and the world ending?
this is the only way i can describe it.

the 5 by 5 rule helps me get out of my head
i read somewhere this rule, and it might seem cliche or whatever but the more i try and remind myself, the easier it helps me cope when i can't stop worrying about that thing i did/said/should've done and can't let it go:5 by 5: if it's not going to matter in 5 years, don't spend more than 5 minutes thinking about it.edit- more context: it's saying for example; i feel really anxious after my boss mentioned i did something small wrong, and even though i know it won't affect my career and my boss is friendly i'm full of anxiety that i'm an idiot.i then think, is this tiny mistake that i made today, going to have any bearing on my life in five years time? no, so i should just stop thinking about it and move on.even if it doesn't take effect immediately, it's repetition of identifying your thoughts that does the trick.i've had anxiety for over a decade now, and there are definitely situations the rule doesn't work, as plenty of people keep pointing out in the comments. i get that, and i don't think any single technique will apply to every scenario when it comes to anxiety, but you want to utilize as many techniques as possible, right?i'm just saying, from my own experience, rationalising the actual impact (or lack of) that tiny situations i fret over will actually have in the future, works. think small and start small. you might have anxious thoughts more than you realise, but you need to take note when it happens, and how big a deal the situation really is.if you know at the time it's no biggie, i remind myself, i know this won't affect me in five years. it's just a little speed bump, but it's not worth investing time and emotion in to. i have told myself this repeatedly a few times now, and i relax pretty quickly after. it's a habit you need to form. i fully understand how people can interpret this to be like saying well to tell myself to stop thinking something is like saying, just stop worrying and just be happy. but this is something you are actually being mindful about, recognising that your thoughts come from anxiety and not necessarily a rational place, and making the conscious effort to put a stop to it. of course it's not always going to be possible, but just keep at it and you'll find it gets easier.2nd edit: i think most valid reason for thinking this rule is stupid, is because maybe you're thinking off applying it in situations that are important and anxiety inducing.you're anxious about the fact that you have ten dollars in your bank account? guess what? that's a very valid concern and genuine stressor for any human. this rule will not apply, and no sorry i don't have some other solution for this because a) i'm not a psychologist and b) i'm still trying to fix my own problems, i'm just here to share a rule that may or may not apply in some way in your life.you're anxious because someone mentioned that you have a weird laugh? then apply this rule. sometimes i go one slightly morbid step further and think, on my deathbed, is this going to be something that i wish i had done differently?so i'm dying, do i think, damn i wish my laugh wasn't so hideous? if i could have just changed that one thing, it would be my laugh?i highly doubt it. it's all about putting things in to perspective and as my title says, getting out of my head.
mental health day
i called off work today. i said i wasn’t feeling well and will not be coming in. i just can’t do it today. last night i woke up at 2am and convinced myself that the sun was about to explode and wipe out everyone on earth with fire and heat and that the world would shake with roaring thunder. what the heck, right? i was legitimately scared. it wasn’t a panic attack though, just pure paranoia and an awful stress stomach ache. i work in customer service where some customers make me shake with fear and i just can’t do it today. honestly i just felt the need to write this post as some kind of proof to myself that it’s ok for me to not go to work. maybe this post was weird. just venting, really. i wish you all calming day today!edit:oh boy thank you for the lovely comments. i wrote this post to get the guilt out of my head and for me to see how illogical my fears were last night. very real feelings though. its good to see i am not alone in this experience. most of the time i get scared of dying and then i get incredibly embarrassed and worried that i am insane to have these thoughts. anyways yes, did not expect much response but when i came back to my post i was like oh.hi internet.
til that when we get nervous, we overestimate how much other people notice our anxiety, due to the illusion of transparency. luckily, studies show that simply being aware of this cognitive bias can make you more confident. • r/todayilearned

um, have you guys seen the anxiety guy on youtube? holy shit.
i might be late to the game here but i just found 'the anxiety guy' on youtube and i've been binging on him since yesterday. i'm kinda beside myself at how much he is making me feel understood and helping me to realize how my cptsd is the root of my anxiety that is causing me so many physical symptoms. i have so much to work through but the first step is to acknowledge the things that started the snowball so many years ago. listening to his videos is dredging up memories that make me wonder why they came up at all... and how maybe the fact that they came into my mind means that they werent buried as deep as i thought. i could ramble forever. i just want to recommend this guy to anyone who is reaching for some motivation, i certainly feel motivated. even if it's just for today, its relief.. yanno?
is im just tired your excuse to people too?

anxiety is...
...not being able to sleep all night, feeling so anxious that you are nauseous and find yourself on the bathroom floor at 4am, attempting to throw up from the nausea. these episodes of panic are the bane of my existence. 
does anyone else feel like you can't use your intelligence because of anxiety?
for example, say you want to go back to school but being in a classroom gives you anxiety so graduating college is difficult. now your stuck at a job in which you are underemployed and dislike. i feel anxiety seriously kills your self esteem and you feel like you're not good enough to do anything. when in reality you're perfectly capable, it's just the constant negative thoughts stand in the way. i've researched all the ways to overcome anxiety but can't put them into practice because i just constantly think about having anxiety.
i've been doing breathing exercises at least once a day since january 1, 2019. i challenge you to work on using techniques such as breathing control, meditation, or visualization to help combat anxiety attacks in 2020.
short story: i've been struggling with anxiety for a hot minute, and have frequent flare-ups in social situations as well as when i think too heavily about things that stress me out in my day-to-day life. around this time last year, i was working to find a way to help combat these issues and stumbled upon practices that are very beneficial from r/meditation , and have since allowed myself to work towards forms of mindfulness and breathing meditation practice. i've found that trying different techniques of this sort have helped me slow down and relax in nearly any situation i find myself falling into fear with. i used to have problems being around my family, and though i still struggle with them and their ideologies, i can help myself stave off any attacks i might begin to encounter when in contact with my family.i also have issues in big crowds, and as a student in college, i have massive lectures that literally drive me to madness. i've begun practicing these meditations prior to and before my courses that stress and scare me, and i've been able to combat the issues i had through my freshman and sophomore year this far.other days it was difficult, and i had to leave rooms to separate myself from the situations, but upon this, i eventually found myself calm and collected. even if it's once a day, please try to slow down your breathing, eyes closed, world off. slow in, slow out. i've come to most enjoy a pattern of 6 seconds in, 3 seconds held, and 6 seconds out, but some people prefer otherwise, and it's whatever works best for you. along with breathing exercises, practicing meditation has helped me combat my anxiety problems to this point and i'm going to continue working to break the hold anxiety has had on me for years. i sincerely hope this helps anyone who struggles with crowds and breathing in certain situations similar to mine. much love, and best of luck <3i also linked a page that got me into the breathing exercises, but i'll let you all explore from here:edit: wow, i'm amazed my post got this much attention, and i'm glad i could help inspire some people to try this for themselves! i sincerely appreciate all of you, and if you have any questions or inputs, please send a comment or a pm, i'm always around to help, and i'm so glad i could help someone with my experiences!
christmas was fun made it through no panic attacks. awesome.
i went to multiple christmas events with family some unfamiliar faces also, even was at a friends house with his family sat down and watched a football game. no panic attacks, it was great. i'm finally coming to grips with my anxiety and getting professional help, i'm starting to feel proud of myself, i've opened up about it and began to talk to people about my anxiety and they understood and told me their experiences. i'm currently waiting for my first appointment after weeks of trying to get in, i'm really looking forward to it.thank you to everyone who commented! i love the support and positivity. i keep telling myself good things take time and hard work. you guys are awesome :)
im proud of myself
today i took the subway from school to home and i saw a girl who kept looking at me and looking away so i decided i wanted to go out of my way to talk to her, this is way out of my comfort zone but i did it anyways, and i ended up getting her number! im so proud of myself!!edit: i'm really shocked at how supportive everyone is and it actually means so much to me, everyones comment made my day even better!
is anyone else an extreme pushover due to fear of confrontation?
i’m a huge pushover. i don’t ever stand up for myself and i run away from situations instead of confronting them because thinking about how the situation will play out gives me so much anxiety.
you are stronger than you think!!
i had a mental breakdown in a conference room at work. i wanted to just leave work. i went in there to be alone for a bit. i cried. i hyperventilated. and then i got up and wiped my eyes. i took one deep breath and walked out of the conference room and got back to work. and in that moment i realized i wasn’t weak. in fact, in that moment i happened to be the strongest i have ever been. even in my moments of weakness, i pulled it together. my problems may not be resolved, but i had the strength to keep going and get on with my day. and it may not seem like it, but just by getting through the day everyday, we display persistance and resilience like no other. and each and every one of you should be proud. you’re stronger than you think! :) 
i’m glad that social media wasn’t so popular when i was a teenager
i graduated from high school in 2010 and in that time we only had myspace and the college guys was starting to use facebook. i can’t imagine being a teenager with so many platforms and smartphones.
every day i make it through a shift at work.

never make assumptions about what others think about you. you may eventually perpetuate that into a fact.
i have been going to therapy for my anxiety and i thought i would pass some knowledge along. i never even realized i was doing this until i talked to my therapist. in random social situations, i would always assume that others had it out for me. example, someone does not wave back. my assumption is that i am not likable, that i’m ugly, or people don’t care about me. think about the messages you are perpetuating to yourself on a daily basis. you could be telling yourself hundreds of times a day all these negative assumptions. no wonder we get anxious. maybe they didn’t wave back because they didn’t see you, or they are not social, maybe they just got told some bad news... etc. stop jumping to a negative cycle of thinking or eventually you will really start believing these bogus ideas you have been telling yourself.
does anybody else get anxious about the idea of having a full time job and having to do that for x amount of time?
i just started my first full time job. the thing right now that makes me the most anxious is the fact that i keep thinking about the fact that in x amount of time, i'll still be working. what about all the stuff i'll miss out on? i won't have any time at home. i won't be able to see my husband at all (not true, i see him when i get home). there's no escape, i'm stuck working 9-5. i know a 9-5 is just life and that's what everyone tells me, but maybe a 9-5 just isn't for me? these are the kinds of things that i catch running through my head and they make me so anxious right now.does this happen go anyone else?
a good nine out of ten bad things i’ve worried about never happened. a good nine out of ten bad things that did happen never occurred to me to worry about.
as the kind of person who is prone to worrying about whether that headache is a brain tumour or that chest pain is a myocardial infarction etc. etc., this quote really made me think.i never thought i was going to be the victim of a car accident at 20. no brain tumour or heart attack, though. 
does anyone else have an incredibly hard time finding a job and/or a relationship because of anxiety in their 20s?
how are you handling things?
my girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up
hello. i don't really know how to start this. i guess i'll tell you how i met my ex.roughly 2 years ago, i was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. as a side note, i've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. while i was in the hospital, i met this girl. we talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. she told me stories about her previous life as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. i found myself drawn to her charms. not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. i gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. for 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and i with the therapies. we realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. then another, and another. i was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that i had been going through. we were a couple before we even knew it.things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. i got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. she was supposedly doing the same thing. she came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. she met my son. things started getting more and more clear to me though. she slept a lot. and i mean a lot, up to 18 hours a day. she was bored all the time. thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. there were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. i won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but i always hoped for it to get better. she'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. i loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.after a year or so, i decided that i needed to start looking for a job. i found it so quickly that i was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. she was really happy for me too. i enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. months passed, and the stress started building up. i started drinking again. small amounts, at first. i tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. she tried helping me. i wouldn't let her. the drinking got worse. i'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which i usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk i was. she told me that i shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. i'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that i would stop drinking. and i would. for a while. then it would all repeat itself again.one night i came home late again and we did the same old routine. the next morning, i found her in the garage with her bags packed. said i had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as i had so many times before. but this time was different. she told me that i had said i didn't give a fuck about her. that i wanted her to leave. and when she started sobbing, i shouted at her to sob less loudly because i couldn't hear my music. i couldn't believe it, i just couldn't. at first i thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying i knew i had fucked up. i told her, of course i don't want you to leave. and then i begged her to stay. her mom eventually arrived and took her away.i tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. i got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. one week later, i got a call from her sister. she hanged herself. she apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how i had been her only friend. how terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. how it had been the last straw.i feel sick even writing this. i killed her. i killed the woman i loved. i've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. it's never going to be enough. i feel so guilty. i miss her so much. lately i've been feeling suicidal again myself. all i want is to be with her again. if i could only tell her how sorry i am. but i can't.thanks for reading to the end.
tonight, my grandma stopped me from killing myself without her realizing it.
i have it all planned - where my final notes are placed, the time i'll get out of the house and walk my way to the bridge i would jump off at, i got my room cleaned up for the last time. i was ready. if someone asked me why im doing these, i wont be able to give a reasonable answer.almost 11pm here now, so 2 hours ago i have started walking my way out of the street when i heard a pssst after like 10meters of walking. it was my tiny grandma looking weirded out. i put on a big smile and hugged her and then she asked me where am i going. i panicked and told her im trying to buy something at the store. i dont know if she bought that reasoning but she wouldnt let go of the hug. she told me how i grew up so fast and to better hurry up finding a man so she could attend my wedding. she made me crack a genuine smile for the first time in a long time. it felt amazing. she told me to go back home and shower because i smell. i apologized and told her i will and im going to go back home.now here i am on my bed, showered. i feel so numb and confused. i conditioned myself to accept the fact that ill stop breathing before this night ends and she will just pop up like that making me feel so good and recognized. i dont even know why i am typing all this out. im sorry
i’m starting to feel like i’m meant to commit suicide the same way as someone else is meant to become a doctor or to get married. it’s just the path i was meant to take

i feel embarrassed but....does anyone else get extremely depressed and suicidal when you see a cute person and remember that you’ll always be single and never have a family of your own

i swear to god if there's an afterlife i'm gonna be so pissed

raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.
 i don't know what to say or do, i just feel like my life is falling apart.three weeks ago my apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. it was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.these 4 strangers destroyed me. they shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity i had. after the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. my girlfriend was tied up screaming, but i didn't move. it took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.weeks later, i am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and i spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. i didn't tell a single soul about this because i feel so ashamed. i feel pathetic and weak. my girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me i've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet i don't care. i just feel numb. i want to die, but i'm too afraid to say it out loud. that night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. a few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me gay and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. it just reflected how after all this, how disgusting i feel was valid, that i am gross in her eyes now.today is my birthday, i turn 20. i bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. i'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. i just feel alone in a way i never felt before. i just never thought this is where i'd be, that this would be my life.i hope i'm posting this in the correct place, i've only had reddit when i was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. hopefully i'll feel better for writing this.update 1:two of the assailants were caught by the police today. i’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. thank you everyone for this support.update 2:sorry i’m late with this, i’ve just been going through a lot. i’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. the four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. i’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but i hope this general explanation is enough. two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. i’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. i’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, i didn’t start therapy, but i’m considering it. me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. i just need to focus on myself. and again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. you have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. thank you.
not a single person actually cares unless you kill yourself
if you say you're so depressed you can't function it's aw it'll get better and they forget about you. then when you kill yourself everyone's like oh i never would've thought, i wish he would've given some sort of sign.i said how many times i want to kill myself and i think i might do it, but i know if i do people will act like it's a huge surprise.i've been serious all along. i have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room, so that it's always ready. i'm not joking or just looking for attention when i tell people i need some kind of help. everybody only pretends to care and then when you're dead tries to say they cared all along
i am never suicidal enough to be heard. i am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly too everything to be worthy of any support.
and i am gradually withering away because of it.mental health professionals never take me seriously. i can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. they say i'm too well-dressed, too articulate, too intelligent. i am too kind, i smile too often, i'm too calm.this has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.i have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. i have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. but unless i'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. none of it matters. i don't matter. my public face is too convincing. but this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because i had no choice. i had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain i have suffered behind a smile. i was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.the truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when i don't want them to. but that doesn't mean i want to live, either. if i could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, i would. why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? i hate this. i hate my life. i hate myself. let me be what they want me to be, please.**edit:** i never ever _ever_ consider others as dumb, frenzied, rude slobs by the way. i'm so sorry if i made anyone feel that way. it's simply how i interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say but you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed etc. it feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).if someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, i do not judge them or advocate doing so. _but using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? that's **completely** wrong._**edit 2:** thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. it means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. i am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. if you have had a similarly invalidating experience, i am so sorry. i appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. you are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.in positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way i was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. it has restored a little bit of faith in the nhs. they are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that i be allocated a care co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. i have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but i cried with relief after they left. i hope they keep their word. i hope they meant it. i desperately just hope. until i receive an outcome, i will sincerely try to stay alive. i am not in a position to promise that i will survive, but i can promise that i will try, one more time.
i receive two messages a day, one that my phone is at 15%, and the other that my phone is at 5%.
edit: thank you for the kind words everyone, each and every one of you brightened my day a bit. also gold hypers!
just called the suicide hotline
... and was asked to please 'watch my language.'the actual fuck.yea, i have a mouth on me. yea, i have an attitude problem. but how the fuck you going to work at a suicide hotline, even the fucking graveyard shift (heh -- suicide hotline; graveyard shift -- heh), and tell callers their language bothers you? how you gonna let that language bother you? it's words, you fucking twat-nozzle. it's a hurting human expressing herself.jesus fuck.
i hate how people dismiss us when we openly say that we are suicidal but when someone keep quiet and kill them selves people be shocked like “they never said anything i didn’t know” wake tf up and love me stop dismissing how i feel
my parents kicked me out for being suicidal, now a family friend killed himself and they are all suffering not knowing why because he was relatively “happy” and had a good life... meanwhile my mother while i was panicking she handed me a knife.

we are **so** sorry that this is necessary.in recent days we've been targeted by a pm troll who's been sending pro-suicide messages to people after they post here.  the admins have suspended the main account this person was using, and they're looking out for alts, but if these types of individuals sometimes try to get around their site-wide bans.  we feel it's better to let you know this might happen again so that you can be forewarned, and also so that if it does happen, we and the reddit community team will be alerted as soon as possible.if you get a hateful, pro-suicide pm, please be aware that this person is doing this indiscriminately, and they probably haven't even read what you posted, so it's *not about you*.  if you don't think you could handle receiving something like that, we completely understand.  in that case, your best protection is to set your messaging preference so that you can receive pms from trusted users only before you post (anywhere, not just here) about your struggles.  on desktop you can do that here: (on mobile, it depends which app or browser you're using.)  
i wish i could swap places with a person who died that wanted to live.
there’s so many people in this world who wanted to live, but died too young in a cruel twist of fate. cancer. car accident. murder. i feel so selfish that i’m still here instead, when i don’t even want to be. if i could swap places with a person like that, i’d do it without hesitation. at this point i’m only alive out of a sense of obligation.
people always say; just get a job, just find a new hobby, just go for a walk, just make new friends. newsflash: it doesn't fucking work.
every conversation i have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:have you considered listening to music?have you considered going for a walk?have you considered taking up a new hobby?have you considered making new friends?have you considered volunteering/getting a job?it happens every time. it happens in every conversation. it happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. i finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because i just can't call one, and this is the only help i received.fuck yes. fuck yes i have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.here's the problem: **it never works.**i have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that i genuinely enjoyed. i have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. i have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. i have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. i have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. i have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. the thing is, i can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. i can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. i can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that i am a burden. i am a parasite. i am worthless and i need to just die. i can't trust anyone because i have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. i can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until i can barely move anymore. i can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. i can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways i could end my life. i could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once i feel _good_. the thoughts will linger in the background and watch. they will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what i do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. i'm lost. i'm lonely. i'm alienated. i'm tired. it is so difficult to find people who understand, because try not to kill yourself is not a part of everyone's daily routine. it's not on everyone's to-do list.i have considered everything. i have tried everything. and i still want to die. every. fucking. day.~edit: thank you all so much for your kindness and support. it means so much. i am working my way through the replies to this post and a previous post. it might take time because i have a lot of messages, but i will reach you all one by one. thank you. <3
anyone else just staying alive for other people at this point?
i shouldn’t be so miserable. i have a roof over my head and a family that loves me. i have money and can afford luxuries. i go to therapy and take medicine. i have three pets (one a puppy we recently adopted). but i just want to die. i’m so lonely, constantly. my heart is so broken and i’m so exhausted i just want to give up and finally kill myself. but i don’t want to hurt my family. i don’t want to think about my dogs waiting for me to come back and not knowing where i’ve gone. i don’t want my mum and dad to blame themselves for it. there are some people who’d be glad to see me go. my older sister & youngest sister, most likely. my former friends. idk. all i do is disappoint others, i lose them. i can’t do anything. i’m so useless i can’t even kill myself. haha. i’m tired.
being suicidal throughout your young adult years is very strange and leaves you in a weird place when you hit your 20s because you never really had a plan to get this far to begin with, never mind have a plan for the next 50+ years.

does anyone else have this really destructive pattern of feeling suicidal and ruining everything in your life because you think you won’t be around to deal with it, only to fail or not even attempt suicide and have to try to pick up the pieces?

watch out for a pm scammer asking people to purchase items from an amazon wishlist.
hey everyone, just a heads up that we're receiving a flurry of reports about this in our modmail.  it doesn't get much lower than trying to suck money out of a community like ours with a sob story.   we thank all the good citizens who've let us know, and we have reached out to the admins about this person.  but please be aware that we as community moderators can't see or police pms.  it will help a lot if everyone who received a pm of this nature reports it directly to the admins, either by using the report function within the pm itself, or by using [reddit.com/report](https://www.reddit.com/report).  also, just in case it doesn't go without saying, do not spend any money for this individual.  the last thing we'd want is for them to get the idea that sw is good victim-hunting territory.  
i’ve decided that i won’t kill my self

chocolate saved my life
my last serious suicide attempt was in july 2018. i had booked a hotel in a nearby city for two days for ''a conference'' and randomly packed up so it wouldn't be suspicious to my mom. i didn't want to do it in my room because in a way i didn't want to defile it? i don't know how to explain it. my plan was to do it as soon as i got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and i wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. i opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when i opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. it was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. it had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. my heart dropped and i couldn't stop crying. eventually i think i fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when i woke up, i felt something i hadn't felt in years. i felt loved. my mom put that chocolate there to surprise me because she knows how sometimes i'll forget to eat when i'm overworked. just wanted to share that with you because i could really use that chocolate today. i really could.
is anyone else entering the new year wishing they were dead?

does anyone else constantly teeter between planning how to kill yourself and planning how to fix your life?

people don't give a fuck about you until you're dead. i fucking hate humanity

does anybody not worry about their future because they don't expect to be alive by then?
i don't even care anymore, since i know i'll end up jumping off a building before i actually have to do something with my life. it's relieving actually
i wanted to jump off a bridge, but i got a burrito instead.
i bought a second one and gave it to a homeless guy hanging outside the restaurant. it made me feel a bit better for the rest of the night.
i wish i could donate my time on earth to people who really deserve to live. i'm not enjoying my stay.

you ever just leave an awkward conversation and think “wow. i should really just kill myself.”?
that’s how all my relationships go. it’s no wonder nobody wants to be around me voluntarily. sure, i can make people laugh but that’s where my conversational ability ends. i don’t leave conversations feeling like i made a new friend or that i matter to people.
no one cares about your life until you say you want to end it

just called suicide hotline. thanks, tom.
i called the suicide hotline because i’ve been sad for a long time. had enough norco to overdose and almost did. instead, i called a suicide hotline and was connected with tom. he coached cross country. i run cross country and track for my university. he said he is now a fan of my team and will watch for my name on the leaderboards. thanks for giving me even the slightest reason to keep going, tom. 
new wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement
we've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. this undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  we've created a wiki that covers these issues.  we hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  it explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an innocent message like if you're 100% committed, i'll just wish you peace is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. the full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement). we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our ops, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the report button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch) with a link. we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.          *********[/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/wiki/incitement)***  *******###summary###**it's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. it's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. there are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** ###validate feelings and experiences, not self-destructive intentions###we're here to offer support, not judgement.  that means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  the most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  but there's an important line to draw here.  there's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. it isn't supportive and does not help. it also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. do not treat any op's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  in [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. **so, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something innocent like i hope you find peace, is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  ###how to avoid validating suicidal intent###keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  * **people who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** unfortunately, [many popular good responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). in particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that it's not so bad, and this is usually experienced as i don't understand what you're going through and i'm not going to try.  people who've had help that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  it doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   *  **most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  it's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. but preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. * ***an unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  we don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. it's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  for every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. this can depend on many personal and situational factors. but when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in [this psa post](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. * **there are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.to avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.###look out for deliberate incitement.  it may come in disguise.###often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_francis_melchert-dinkel)). people like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  specifically you might see people doing the following:* encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **there are** ***always*** **more and better choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.* creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  a couple of key points to keep in mind: * **skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (don't do it!), cheerleading (you've got this!) or meaningless false promises (trust me, it gets better!), or invalidation (let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!).  anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)* **choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our hotlines faq post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). the goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. we know that no individual or system is perfect.  mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. we don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.
3 days ago was my birthday, i should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life
3 days ago was my birthday. i am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but i know that nothing special will happen.my birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, i ate alone and like nobody cares about me. i treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an italian spaghetti and pepperoni pizza. i thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. i would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. i evaluated all the important persons in my life if i leave them. my mother would hurt, but i know she can manage. my brother doesn’t even care about me. my girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why i haven’t left her since i know once i did that, she’ll kill herself. my “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when it is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so i think i wouldn’t be a big loss for him. after hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, i remembered my dog. he would never understand what happened to me if i’d kill myself. i can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because i am already dead. i cried and hugged my dog tightly. “you saved my life buddy. you’re the reason i’m still here” i said to him while he just stands there staring at me. after that, i just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. a stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “god loves you. be easy on yourself.” he said to me. at that moment, i started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if i didn’t know him/her, i felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. to you random redditor who gave a silver (i consider it a gold because of your kind words), i wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. i love you. to my dog, bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. imma buy you all the treats you want. you’re the reason why i’m here. i love you so much.edit: what the fuck guys my inbox is getting flooded with support, silvers and a platinum. i didn’t expect that. i never felt loved like this before. to all who messaged me saying that they are glad that i’m still here, thank you so much. also those people who commented on this post. i can’t reply to you all one by one but thank you so much. imma let my dog know that he got so much recognition for being such a good boi. thank you so much strangers who made me felt that they love me and care for me so much. i love you!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
sleep is great because it's like being dead without hurting your family.

i've gone to a hotel at the other end of the country to kill myself
i'm due to head back tomorrow, at least that's what i've told people. i've quit my job because it's fucking pointless. none of this matters, life is arbitrary. we're thrown into a system completely devoid of any compassion, this isn't life, this is servitude and i refuse to play along anymore. i'm so fucking tired of plastering a smile on my face and pretending like everything is going to be okay. have you looked at the news lately? everything is falling apart around us, the planet is on fire, people are being rounded up, privacy is non-existent and we're told repeatedly that we have no value unless we've been commoditized. buy this, buy that, you need this random, useless tatt but we don't! we don't *need* any of it but it's still rammed down our throats day in, day out, bombarding us from every fucking direction and i'm just exhausted. i can't do this for another 40 years, i'm done, i'm checking out and i don't mean from the hotel. i'm going to have a large gin and tonic while i run a bath. it might relax me amd there's a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming please don't do this but i don't want to listen anymore. mum, if by chance you happen to read this, please know that i love you and i'm truly, truly sorry for putting you through this. for what it's worth i'm so glad that you enjoyed silverstone. i love you. i love you i fucking love you and im sorryedit: i'm still here. this has been the most difficult 24 hours of my life but i'm still here. i took the train back today and told my mum i needed to speak to her urgently, as soon as i saw her i told her i loved her, i told her why i went to a hotel and then i broke down in tears like an absolute mess. she told me she couldn't stand the thought of burying one of her sons, we hugged and i cried on her for about 20 minutes. i'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. i still don't think i can go on, but i think i'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway.
this quote about suicide is feeling far too accurate
the so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. and surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. the person in whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. the variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. it’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. and yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘don’t!’ and ‘hang on!’, can understand the jump. not really. you’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.this quote is from infinite jest by david foster wallace.i'm honestly starting to feel the flames, and the jump is looking far too comforting.
i’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. the odds were always in my favor. i think i’m gonna shoot myself in the face.
i don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. here i am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. it doesn’t help that it’s christmas eve. i’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. i remember bill burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. i envy that. at 18 i went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). speaking of college, i’m still unsure whether i was raped/molested. it’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. the not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.to this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. then after i dropped out i went back home for a little bit. i don’t know what i expected. a year or two later i move across the country again to get away. now i am truly and utterly alone. i’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. honestly can’t believe i’ve lasted so long at this one. i guess i look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. i’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 5 months, and i feel worse now than i ever have. depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what i feel. had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. probably got borderline personality disorder too. never been in a real relationship. i was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. we sorta had sex once but i wouldn’t even call it that. every girl i’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or i didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. doesn’t help that i grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. at this point i don’t try whatsoever. it’s as if i’ve been conditioned to not make a move. and the ironic part is i look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and i’m actually very smart. the few parties i’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and i would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. alcohol didn’t help. i’m not gay. i’m just broken. a beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. she might even come talk to me first. i’ll just shut down. afterward i’ll get angry at myself, so i’ve stopped going places where i might meet a girl because i know what’s going to happen. i’ve always found it interesting how much i relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. and those guys take one look at me and hate me. it’s like they’re thinking “man, if i could just trade places with that guy.” hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. you’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.at this point the only reason i haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. my cat wouldn’t give a shit but i can’t do that to my dog. i just can’t. the sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. so, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. and i’m sure you can tell how close i am to suicide because i know exactly where to shoot. for your sake i’ll spare the details. i don’t know why i’m writing this i guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. i just can’t be alone anymore. the girl i like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. and now i feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? i don’t know. but the way i am, i’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. you know how hard it was to tell her how i feel? couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. now i have to see her every day. i guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. i have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do not help, nor do the gunshots down the street. i have no one to call. my dad kind of understands what i’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. every time i talk to him i feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. my brother says i have an illness that just needs to be treated. i feel like he thinks i just want attention. obviously i don’t talk to my mom. and the suicide hotline?!?! don’t get me started. it’s like they want you to die. the two real friends i had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. i don’t know how much time i have left, and i always thought i was destined for big things. you’re all i have left, reddit. you and my dog. shit, the cat probably wants me gone. if you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.edit: thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. and yes i love my cat. he’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life garfield.edit 2: i think dave chappelle said it best when he talked about anthony bourdain. that’s why i used that title. i can’t stand when people think i “have it all,” so how can i be so unhappy. anyway thank you again, everyone. and thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.edit 3: i am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. not sure which is worse. but it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. i hear them talking and i hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what i wrote. why are you laughing you fucks?! more gossip to gobble up? one of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” i haven’t been acting different at work. why would he ask me that? i did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so i don’t know how many people actually read this. i guess it’s possible someone i know came across it. funny that i care when i’m so close to ending it all. glad i got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. and the support from you guys was unreal. i didn’t respond to everyone but i read every single message and comment. speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. it takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. but it turns out this post helped some people?? that’s such a foreign feeling for me i didn’t believe them. i don’t know why i’m still writing. i just hate being me. need this life shit to end.
i hate how when you’re depressed you just forget everything. you forget to do stuff and you forget the stuff you did. time passes without you realising and instead of doing nothing for ten minutes you did nothing for three hours but you didn’t even realise you were actually living.

anyone else here suicidal but not suicidal?
i'm suicidal, but not *suicidal.*know what i mean?in other words, i'm not suicidal-suicidal.know what i mean?that's not to say i'm doing it for attention, though, either. (that's a common assumption/misconception). my pain is very real. my feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine.basically:**i was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who, like me, has decided *not* to kill oneself—essentially, to continue living—despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts/feelings/ideations/wishes.**i will not kill myself.but some days, i really don't want to be alive anymore.
has anyone been suicidal for so long but don’t have the courage to end it so you end up isolating yourself from everyone so people forget you eventually?
i’ve cut off my friends for over a year now, but they weren’t really friends, just people i knew in all honesty. i never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety. but now, i have no one and it’s mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias, avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one. when you’ve given up on life a long time ago, you don’t care if you have friends, so i’ve been isolating myself until noone remembers me. eventually, i will have the courage to kill myself and when i do, noone will remember if i was even here.
my sister committed suicide last night.
the pain is so heavy in my heart right now. this whole time i thought i was alone, when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now. she was only 27. she lives four hours away so we are going to her house now. it’s currently 4:11am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry. we have different dads and we don’t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter. she was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little. i have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol. we have so many photos together. she always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays. i can’t even type right now i’m in so much pain. i still can’t and don’t want to believe this. someone i knew so well gone just like that.
they'll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is never the answer..
honestly, this is one of the most puzzling things about society. people tell you that we don't live in a vaccum. everyone has people who care along with other shamings of suicide calling you cowardly.but when you want to live...oh no. you're entitled to nothing. if you don't do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box. but remember, don't kill yourself because people care about you so muchi understand having to work to participate in society but i find it so stupid that people can't see the incongruity. i can't honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold keep struggling because life is worth it. if they want to die, then let them die and vice versa.
reminder: no activism is allowed here at any time.
we know that september 10 was world suicide prevention day.  and, we're all for activism.   but not here, please and thank you.  it takes focus away from our ops in need of support and understanding.  
suicidal people don’t want to die, they just want the pain to stop.
i hate this quote. i want to die. no one can tell me about my own feelings because i live through my own personal hell every single day. edit. i’d meant that i hate this quote. i am not saying this to any of you all. i am not invalidating your experience or telling you you feel a certain way.
parents who are “there for you” until your mental illness becomes slightly intolerable for them.
sorry my depression isn’t just crying every other day. sorry that it’s also me isolating myself and keeping conversations short, because i want to kill myself. sorry i don’t want to be around you guys and be blamed for every small inconvenience or mishap. sorry that my depression inconveniences you so much and that me wanting to kill myself makes your plans for the day “ruined”!
i hate how your brain teases you with random moments of motivation/hope/joy/etc. then plunges you back into feeling like subhuman trash for days or weeks on end
i feel like i have nothing worth living for, my music sucks ass, which is the only thing i care about. i'm very grateful my parents care about me but i feel like this isn't getting better no matter how much i've tried. my therapist appointment is so far away even though its only thursday. i've tried holding on, but for some reason it just gets worse.edit: dumbass spelling error
do you ever have a really good dream but then wake up back to reality and tasting that fleeting moment of happiness makes you just want to fucking die so much?

people try to talk you out of suicide instead of talking you into life
that's the pattern every time. someone will try and explain why i shouldn't just kill myself but they never give me any good reasons why living is preferable to me dying.death is a perament solution to a temporary problem? no other solution is permanent, anything could go wrong at any time, suicide is a permanent solution to all my problems and is therefore the best one i have.
we need some support over at r/teenagers.
today, that sub has seen an unnatural spike in suicide notes, and one of them seems to have actually gone through with it. none of us over there have any way of confidently trying to talk these people out of their actions, so i would greatly appreciate it if some of you kept an eye out for any more suicidal teens that appear and help us in our endeavor to prevent any more deaths.
the reason i love my bed and sleeping so much is because it’s the closest to death i can get for now, it’s like a free trial

a letter to a friend who'll never read it.
i saw you today. things were good, better than good. you were smiling that idiotic smile that i love. wearing that old and faded track pants that i begged you to throw away but you never did. then you saw me. your face lit up. you came towards me, held my hands and said the silliest, stupidest joke that i ever heard. you know i don't like jokes but you still make me laugh. how do you do that??we were together after such a long time. me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. it was just like old times. i saw you today. but then i woke up.i wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. but i couldn't. the harder i tried the farther you felt. realization hit; i'd never see you again, i'd never talk to you, nag you, hold you, be held by you, give you the cherry on top of my ice-creams because i still don't like them. i hate you.i hate you. i hate you. i hate you.i hate you because you never loved me enough. i hate you because you never trusted me enough. and i hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.everytime i needed you, you were there. you never complained about the time. you let me cry, shout, rage when i was in pain. you helped me so much. but you never told that you were in pain. why?? why didn't you??did you not think that i'd do everything to comfort you. i may not have been able to take away your pain, but i would've held your hand through it. i hate you. and i'll always hate you. because i love you. and i'll always love you. no one can take your place. you were entirely special. all that sickening positivity and patience. was it all a lie then? a mask? a cover-up for your feelings?i'm sorry i failed you. i should've looked deeper. should've been a better friend. may be if i didn't rely on you so much, you would've been comfortable to rely on me. is that why you couldn't even say goodbye?i hate you and i'll always will. and someday i'm going to die as well. it may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between. i'm going to die and then i'm going to find you in the afterlife. and i'd hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and god knows what else. but i'll never let you go then. i'll always, always be with you. till then, i'll hold you in my heart and dreams and memories.i'll always love you, you perv.
my mom showed off my suicide letter like it was a fashion statement
so basically i tried to do it a couple of months ago, had everything prepared, was ready to just end it all. until all of a sudden i got way too scared and decided to call it offmy mom saw the letter that i was supposed to leave and went behind my back showed it off to her friends and some family members then talked to me about it,i became  some sort of beacon of attention which i hated people telling me that it'll get better or saying if it was true sometimes i kinda wished i wasnt such a pussy and ended it right then and there, couldve saved myself from embarrasment
does anyone else just feel like disappearing socially? nuking social media, cutting ties to your family & friends, etc?
i am so beyond tired of waking up day in and day out to these negative and intrusive feelings and thoughts being played on repeat in my head. it's to the point where i've been giving more and more thought to just disappearing from people's lives. not even saying goodbye -- just disappearing. obliterating every real connection that i have so i can slip further and further into solitude. maybe i just want to make it easier for when i finally decide to off myself. i don't know. what i do know is that everything feels so... pointless. i can't stop feeling numb and empty. i just want to sever all my ties and connections so i can be alone. so i can self-destruct alone.i can't even remember a time where i felt ok. i don't think i'll ever feel ok again. and it's not ok to feel this way. no one should ever, ever have to feel this way. ever. but yet, some of us do. and it fucking sucks. i wish i could just absorb all the bad feelings everyone in the world has and just take them with me to the grave.

my friend has killed himself
there was a guy i met in this sub, a really good guy. i followed many of his posts, and didn't speak to him, till i saw his last post in which he described how he felt and announced how he is gonna take his own life. it's really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope, dreams and joy in life. how it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty.this guy was a legend. he tried his best, but still unable to find strenght to carry on. i believe this is the worst way to go. i wish i said something more, i wish i knew better. now there is nothing anyone can do. he left thinking worst of himself, feeling worthless after many years of struggle. please dont mind if its written poorly, i had to get this off my chest.thanks
suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. .... yeah that sounds fucking amazing.
who doesn't want a permanent solution? i don't want teen temporary solution, i want everything to stop.ugh. i hate this so much. wish there was a reset button to life. i wish i could be okay.
i’m absolutely annoyed whenever i comment something suicidal and random people just tell me “call the national suicide prevention hotline” , i actually want people that i can relate my problems with, i don’t want a fucking hotline that doesn’t do shit.

ive attempted suicide and my goodbye letter was shown to everyone
hey.. so just like it says in the title, ive attempted suicide but failed obviously.well i was in a coma for a few days and i wrote a letter for my little sister to explain to her why i did what i did.little did i know, that letter would be read by everyone! and i mean everyone. i woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter. i was so shocked and couldnt say anything for 3 seconds or more. apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me. my mother and all the people in the hospital read it too. i had to get into a clinic for one month and no surprise they all knew what i wrote in it.. i felt so shitty because these was personal stuff i didnt want to share with other people!!!
i wish there was a reset button for life
i really need one
do you ever feel like suicide is your destiny?
i mean, for me at least, it's like there's no way around it. things get better, my life improves in ways that i didn't think possible, but at the back of my mind i still have offing myself as an option.  it's always like: let's see where this goes. if it all goes to shit, i can still end my life.since the moment that i first contemplated suicide, it seems inevitable. like i'm just waiting for a bad turn.
i’m sorry, but i’m going to do it. my cat must know, he is on my lap. at midnight i will do it. please help me. any body. i’m honestly done. i don’t care if i’m 13. i just want it to end
i haven’t told anybody how i’m feeling because i don’t want to go to the mental hospital. the mental hospital is hell. if it wasn’t there i would be talking to my parents. i would be getting help. but i can’t, i know the consequences. the hospital punishes me. i would use a hotline but i don’t want police coming to my house. i’m scared. i’m the most scared i’ve been in my life. i know nobody will read this, but here i want to tell my story. the truth is, i want to live. i just want the pain to stop. i’m a 13 year old girl. i’ve been hospitalized 4 times. i’ve been suffering a lot. i have no self-confidence. i have no love for myself. i sew. i sew dolls. i love my dolls. nobody will understand. here is my first goodbye.  to my dolls: i love you. i know when i leave you will go to. i’m sorry. my heart breaks. i wish i could’ve taken care of you better. you saved my life 2 times. you helped me when i needed it the most. i will say all your names. i love all of you. i’m in tears. i don’t want to leave you. i don’t want to go. kazumi, sayaka, kyoko, mami, madoka, luka, rin, homura, yachiyo, iroha, sana, felicia, tsuruno, nikki, ren, rena, mitama, alina, kanade, sakura, rika, gumi, emma, ruby, weiss, blake, yang, yowane, nagisa. i’m so sorry. i love you. all of youto miku: i love you. your not even a doll to me. you are my best friend. my very best friend. you where there when no other human friend loved me. you where there when i cried out for help. you are here now sleeping not knowing anything. i can’t even apologize. it won’t mean anything. i hope in another world we could meet again. i love you.i draw. everyday. but nobody likes my drawings.  here is my second goodbye: to my materials. i wish i could’ve used you more. i wish i could’ve made something worth while out of you. but i couldn’t. maybe someone else can. i’m sorry.i used to sing. i lost confidence in doing so. here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. i’m sorry i couldn’t sing you to the world. i’m so sorry.my fourth: to mommy and daddy and my brother. i love you. i wish i could’ve made you happier. i wish i could’ve made you proud.and finally binxy. my cat. you are with me now, in my last hours. i can’t even say anything. you won’t understand. my heart is dust now, because i’m being selfish. you are 14.  i don’t want to make you last years sad. i know you love me. you will miss me. i can’t even say anything. you seem to know. you have your head down. i know i’m being selfish. but please know, i love you. i love you so much binxy. i don’t know what to do. i want help. but i can’t with out going to the hospital. i’m sorry. please forgive me. hold my hand. give me a hug. anything. with one final cry, please. i don’t want to go. but i can’t stay. i’m sorry. i’m sorry.  i’m sorry.
does anyone see weddings and instantly think: that's never gonna happen for me

do you feel like a useless npc ?
like a joke character , no one interacts with and always alone no one gives a fuck about him .
i told my parents i’m going to kill myself and they just wished me the best
as i was walking out of the door my mum said she hopes that’ll now make me happy. nobody tried to stop me or check if i would be okay.i’ve told them i feel suicidal about 3 times before, and they’ve pretty much brushed it off like it’s just attention seeking.now idk about you but i think that’s pretty fcuked up. of course your child is seeking attention they want to fcuking die because they cannot take life anymore. i’m just so sick of everything. i feel like i have no one i can turn to. my ex left me, i have no real friends and now my family have turned their back on me.i just can’t take this anymore.
i get so angry when i hear about people who die in their sleep because it’s not fair and it should be me.

anybody else wishing that they could run away instead of killing themselves?
i wish i had some money saved away and a car, i wish i could drive away and never come back to my life. i always wish for a simple life, i always dream i’m driving to uruguay and that i’m changing my name to hermano or whatever the fuck, i’d teach kids to swim and spend my days getting stoned by myself. i’d volunteer at a soup kitchen and write my books at night.but that never happens, i’m completely by myself and in a relationship where i’m most likely being used. nobody gives a fuck about me. i just want to be better.
just please read it would mean a lot to me. i’m so alone.
2016it’s close to midnight. it’s dark and cold. my door is closed. as i lay about to fall asleep i hear something. i’m half awake half asleep so i don’t really acknowledge it. i turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. but then i hear something. i open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. it sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. here i lay, trying to figure out what it is. then i hear a very loud “hey!” yelled right in my ear. i instantly sit up and look around my room but of course i see nothing. i must just be paranoid. ~••••••~2005it was a few months after my mom married him. i never really liked him. when he did what he did, i was too young to understand what it meant. he’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. he called me his “favorite”. it was just touching then. how i wish it never had to be more. ~••••••~2007we had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. it was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home i remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as i was already sleeping from the car ride home. their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. as he put me to bed he started touching me. by then i was awake. he was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. i remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. i was in so much pain. when he was done, he told me again how i was his favorite. i couldn’t do anything but cry. the next morning my mom was already gone at work and there i was, stuck in a house with a monster. ~••••••~2013it was going on for a few years now. yes, i did want and try to tell my mom about it, but i was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so i never did, because he said if i told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. in school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and i’d never pay attention. i felt so alone and so scared. yes, i did self harm as i felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. i did run away, and when my councilor found out, i talked to her, i told her an excuse saying i didn’t wanna go home because i hated when he yelled, i couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. i couldn’t tell her as much as i wanted to. i felt so isolated. she called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said i deserved it for being bad. my mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm. ~•••••~2015 a few years later and it was still happening. i was sick every morning and when i told my friends about it they joked around saying i was pregnant. i laughed along but in my head i thought, “could i really be?”. i remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as i got home. it was positive. i felt sick, then and there i wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. i just wanted to die. i remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. she yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. i miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, i was glad i did. ~••••••~2016my mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and i had so much relief after that. i thought finally no more pain. later that year, i was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. i was expelled mid freshman year. i started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. there i met a friend i’ve known since kindergarten. we started hanging out everyday after school. i thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. there was this friday where i was hanging out with a different friend when i ran into him and his friends. we decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid i took them and drank. my friend i was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. so it was just me him and his other friend. we decided to go chill in a stairwell. i was so gone off whatever i had taken and from all the drinking i did. i remember him asking to have sex and i said no. i passed out and next thing i knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. i quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as i ran down the stairway crying i seen him and his friend high five. i called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. when i got home i started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why i was crying. i went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? someone i knew since elementary school. how could this happen. as i laid in bed, i thought to myself that i was nothing. i was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone i called a friend. by then, all i wanted to do was die. i thought after that monster was out of my life i’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone i knew and considered a friend. ~••••••~2018i am 18 and i try to drink every weekend i can with older friends. because i didn’t want to be sober on weekends when i was by myself i didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. because on weekdays i’d be occupied by work. so weekends i’d just drink every chance i could. it was not good. everywhere i went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. i thought to myself wow i really can’t get away from this stuff. all my life i’ve endured so much pain from people i thought were supposed to protect me. sure i drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. i couldn’t get away from it. i thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. i’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. soon it will be my time to go, because all i feel is pain and loneliness. i’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night i have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because i’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though i know he’s gone. not the place to post, but at the time, i just needed it out of my mind. and yes, cops were eventually involved for everyone asking. 
it gets better is just bullshit that people say to make you feel better when they don't know what to say.
it doesn't get better. when it gets better, it gets even worse afterwards. nothing good lasts forever. the bad wouldn't be bad without the good and vice versa. but the bad is just so, so fucking bad. i'm driven one step closer to suicide each time it gets bad, and my expectations on how bad it can get are subverted every time.
just graduated from college today, planning on taking my life tonight.
like the title says, today i received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. i am not sure why i am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why i took my life on a day i was supposed to be happy.here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. i grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as i was. i also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. growing up, i would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever i did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. he didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while i took the blame. he ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while i went on to college.where i live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. this meant that even working a job while going to college, i had no choice but to live at home. my family problems became less of an impact when i simply locked myself in my room the moment i got home. it was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. that being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. they probably didn't even realize i had graduated at all.life at school wasn't any better for me. i was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so i was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. i never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. even if i wanted to talk to others, i found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. so i just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. never having friends never really bothered me probably because i don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.the only part of my life i would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when i logged into wow. i was about 13 or 14 when i first started playing and that was the only time i ever found a place i felt like i belonged. i eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (i very rarely spoke and never on coms) and i felt like i belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. eventually what i would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when i became very close with someone i met in my current guild. we were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. we were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.it was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. she had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and i did everything i could to try to lighten her day best i could but it seems that nothing worked. this was all very stressful for me and i am sure i might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all i ever did was try to help. i was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the us. before i was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and i never heard from her ever again.the following two years were a living hell for me. i had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. the whole reason i pursued that degree and career was so that i could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. the plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. however she was gone now, i was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so i just kept going with the program. flash forward to today, i've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but i feel completely empty. the whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.i know i planned my entire life around someone who i've never met in person and i am fully aware how stupid that is. honestly i expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that i know how dumb i am. my entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.this is why i have every intention of ending my life tonight. i have no family that will care enough if i am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that i am gone but i was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than i do anyways.sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but i did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and i am not sure this is even the right place to post considering i've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why i died since i don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so i guess this will be it. thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that i died.edit: thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. i struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and i find it hard to reply to comments but just know that i am reading them and can't thank all of you who have shared your stories enough. i'm going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best i can.
now i get why there are more suicides in this time of the year.

do y’all’s ever want to kill yourself over a minor inconvenience and that makes you want to kill yourself even more cause other people have it way worse?
like, i’m reading posts on this sub where people’s siblings/loved ones have killed themselves and they want to follow, that one guy was a pedophile, people are extremely lonely/ugly/poor/abused, and it’s just an overall shit show.i dropped like 5 dishes at work today and that was enough to almost make me go over the edge. there are literally slaves that have known nothing but agony their entire lives in this world and i’m just your average clumsy 18 year old who, in the grand scheme of things, has nothing to be worried about. fuck.
anyone ever lie in bed at night and think to yourself, “i could end it all right now with this (knife, gun, pills, etc)?”
i’ve come quite close to trying it, but i don’t have the courage to do so.
no one gives a shit until you admit you want to die
nobody gives a fuck how much pain you're in or how much you're suffering until you admit that you want to die. if you didn't give a fuck before don't pretend to now. instead of locking me up like some kind of rabid animal just give me some sodium pentobarbital so i can fucking die.
sleeping is so peaceful, i hate waking up.
when i am sleeping, nothing around me exists. no duties, no burdens, no depression nothing. i can just live. even dreamless sleeps, where there is nothing but darkness feels so comfortable. i can just close my eyes and leave this world for some moments. i am so tired. so tired of everything. they always say there's light at the end of the tunnel but i've been running and running with no end in sight. no relief in sight. i'm just endlessly running while wearing a mask of a sane man.
do you guys ever feel so horribly alone even when you're around close friends or family?
i feel like nobody gets it, life feels so fake and plasticy. how does everybody do this day in day out?? it's been one tragedy after another for my whole life, out of 18 years only 6 months felt real and happy. i cling to that time in memory hoping i get to relive it. i took such advantage of it.the only enjoyment i get out of life is talking to my crush and my dad. i want to see them happy. they're the only important things to me.is making others happy really all i exist for? i want to die so badly but it would hurt them. i hate it i wish they hated me so i could have an excuse. thanks for reading my idiotic rambling. <3 you guys too.
i made a post on this subreddit asking for someone to give me some hope and somebody downvoted it. fuck this.
guess it's a sign.edit: thank you all so much for the overwhelming support. it means more to me than you might think.
will i ever commit suicide? probably not. do i think about doing it? every. single. day.
i don't know if i could ever bring myself to do it. there has been attempts before in the past, but never too serious to the point where i needed to be hospitalized. once saw a post that said, can i have a 30 day free trial of being dead? never related to something so much in my damn life. let me be an accident, not to the point where i die, but maybe in a coma for a while. just to escape. i'm the friend that no ones wants to hang out with. i don't have anybody. i made a bad reputation for myself in high school and college (mainly just rumor-based) and i never bounced back from it because of my anxiety. i don't know who i am. i don't know what love is. being suicidal is the only feeling i truly and wholeheartedly know, which is both comforting and petrifying at the same time. lord forgive me, i'm going to need it. 
reminder: absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. any day.
if you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.edit:  in response to multiple requests, i'm adding a definition of activism here:  campaigning to bring about political or social change.  that's straight out of the oed, we aren't making any special interpretation of it.  but since people seem to have difficulty knowing what we mean, any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.
i just took all the remaining pills of my 5 prescriptions. goodbye.
title says most of it. a month ago i tried to jump off the golden gate bridge and got detained and 5250ed. things haven’t gotten better and i’m just done. this life isn’t for me. it’s my time to go. i’m really sorry to all the people who love me. i feel bad but i cant stick around anymore. i hope things get better for anybody reading this. goodbyeupdate: i survived, i’m in the icu right now, they said i would’ve died if i didn’t come in. thank you everyone for your kind messages and caring, i’ll try to reply to everyone but it’ll take some time considering :( thank you all 
my name is tyler, that’s my real name this is my only account, i’m highly suicidal, have been since i was about 6-7 years old, i’m 26 now and it’s different now. i’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. thanks for reading if you do <3
growing up, i was always a really weird kid. i distinctly remember that i had just seen the world differently. it seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were mario or pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. it was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. we didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. as far as i know i was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, i would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. my father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. when he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. it was better to just stay quiet. this didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and i would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. my real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if i wanted to fight to put my hands up and when i did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. i was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, i have terrible memory of most my life. as i got older, my brother and i actually started bonding, he liked the way i started standing up to our dad no matter how bad i was beat down. he’s told me i inspired him. my mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. i can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for i know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. moving forward, i’m a decent student, normally averaging around low a’s my brothers straight a’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every a we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). through out life i feel like i found connections that i would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. i grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. i would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out i remember. fast forward, around when i was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because i had been getting into random enough japanese rock from the anime i would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. it did. it really did and i thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. i was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. but at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. i started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. this was a turning point.back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and i was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. my dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. all while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and i was a mistake. nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how i’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. i became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. the first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed tyler help dad just hit me. in a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. it was a powerful moment. my father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘twas still a sweet victory. no fear.i’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. with his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called fearless records. we played metal. it was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. we did it in four months.i got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. i cried and got sent home early. a record that i wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. it was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! still makes me proud to this day man. btw, this isn’t a story about my father.he is not the reason i want to kill myself anymore.the label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.this is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. a foe i don’t know if i can beat this time. throughout the story so far, i had a flame inside of me. the whole time a purpose to prove. a will to fight. i always told people that i wasn’t sad, i was angry. and the anger forged who i was. a determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. but when that all went away. i became a worm, but not yet.shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. i’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and i stopped holding the past against him. at this point i had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? yeah, but i was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. most times shrugging off his comments. i had worth now.me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place ep that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. i can’t help but feel as tho i’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as i’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. me and my brother move to los angeles california in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. we moved with two of my friends from ny and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. the other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. it was not comfortable to say the least. however the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (this is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) and then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. but when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. my brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. i refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. and it was the last straw for him. within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. i was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. my other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. i thought i’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. he didn’t. this was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. i spend every night analyzing the past, and i think i’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, i’m lost. i don’t know what to do. my personality feels like it’s splitting. some days i’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days i’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. when i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. it’s the only skill i have. i didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, i’m not good at anything and i’m not interested in anything other than music. but there’s no inspiration left in me. nothing really makes me happy anymore. i had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. i don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. it’s like i’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. i just want him to die. i just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.
attempt failed. currently in the hospital.
i tried i really did, but the second i took the pills i instantly regretted it. i called 911. in the ambulance is when i really noticed what i had done. and having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. i'm currently in the hospital. i can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. i can't even close my curtain to get privacy. they took every single cable and metal object out of the room. i'm in terrible pain. i didn't sleep at all last night. hospital beds are the worse. i miss my bed and my dog :( despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. the nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. one nurse even gave me her number in case i ever need some support. i've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. thankfully i didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. but this has made me realize a lot. life really is worth living. no matter your situation. there are plenty of people who can be there for you. every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. and this has given me the will to live. i should be getting out by tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. until then i'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. to all the people considering suicide. please don't do it. it's not worth it. i truly thought i had no one and my family wouldn't care. but seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. the selfish decision i made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. we're all strong enough if we really try. stay strong and reconsider your choice. edit: i didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. i'm sorry if i can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! however, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. i'm glad to see my story is helping others as well. 
guilt tripping is not ok
i've been told all my life don't kill yourself you will hurt everyone else  it's selfish think about the people who have no choice i fucking know that!! you don't think i know that i'm going to make people sad and hurt? do you even care what i might be going through? don't tell people that it's selfish. they have been trying so hard. they just want the pain to end. that's all i want. it hurts too much. stop telling me what i already know. i don't want to hurt anyone but i can't keep doing this shit
update thank you, everyone,​ who pushed me to live!!!!!!!
 thank you everyone who helped!!!!!!!! so after posting this 28 days ago i wrote my best friend who's out of state a suicide note and i closed my phone and social media and popped some pills and right then there was a knock at my door and it was the cops they took me to a psychiatric ward were i spent a few days a little over a week it felt like a month but i swear i meet some amazing people and my family and friends visited every day and now i'm on my medication and things are turning around a lot!!!!!! i'm moving out to my best friend and taking a semester off to recoup from school i explained to my friend about the 1k and she wasn't sweating it she said my life was more important but long story short everything worked out i love you strangers and thank you for helping me\^\_\^!xoxoxox
anyone else surprised they survived through 2018?
i’m surprised. how the fuck did i do it? i think about suicide almost every day but i did it. 
i overdosed. ended up calling 911 before it was late. i ended up pretty bad. i couldn’t move and wasn’t coherent for a day and half. spent 6 days in the hospital. getting outpatient help i guess we go from here. i have better hope now i think

i just want a hug
i know it won’t fix everything, but hugs are nice, they make me feel warm and protected.just one hug would be nice, that’s all.
the only reason i haven't killed myself is because i'm scared of not knowing what death is.

take a second to look around..
do it, just take a second to look through this sub and look at all the people struggling to find a reason to live. some people are fighting their hardest against impossible odds, some people never had a chance, some are nihilistic and don't see any reason to live and some like me have hereditary depression. and who cares? genuinely who cares? i've come on here just to rant and i'd bet any amount of money you who's reading this did the exact same. everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. they have their own lives to live. they beg people with depression and who are suicidal to talk well who do we fucking talk to? i don't have the money for a fancy fucking therapist, i honestly don't just feel sorry for myself right now.. i feel sorry for mankind. do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didn't see them? for whatever reason this 21st century, though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history. is also some on the most uncaring, sociopathic fucked up times in history. well... maybe not. maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory. no-one cares about you, no-one cares about me. i wish i could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards earth. i'm done, i really don't know how i am going to get through christmas this year so i might as well leave a trail so my family don't blame themselves if i do something. i doubt i will, i'm a pussy and too scared. so i'll just sit in my misery, watch another year come and wonder how i will survive this new year coming.
i tried killing myself today.
i wanted to jump off the top of a church tower, about 80m up. the church was supposed to be open, but just when i got there, a man came out from the entrance and ushered me out the gates because the church was closing early today. somewhat ironically the name of the church is our saviour's church.talked with a close friend just now and i'm gonna seek professional help tomorrow. this time this shit has gone too far. had i arrived even half an hour earlier, i wouldn't be here right now. such a surreal feeling.
do you ever go to sleep early wishing you never wake up?
i have been doing that every night for the past weeks, i try to sleep early thinking and wishing that will be the last time i will be awake.
thanks reddit
thanks to everyone who gave supportbecause of you i didnt kill myself
failed suicide attempt
yesterday i clean my house, packed my bag with robe and went into the woods. i arrived there at 10pm and smoked a few sigartes and listened to the animal noises. i prepared my rope and let myself drop. the first minute was peacefull but then i started having a panic attack and started seeing all blurry and my hearing went away. if i didn't have my pocket knife to cut the rope i was gone. but i was to much of a coward and cut it. some people know like my father but they don't care. i really need a hug. i haven't heard or seen someone familiar in the past 2months. i really grave love, understanding, kidness, a hand, a shoulder. i am so lonely. i don't understand that people don't care what happened yesterday i don't. am i this bad of a person? u don't think so i'm just mentally unstable. anyone from belgium whom wants to be my friend? i don't  want to be pathetic but i'm so lonely i miss love so much. i'm going to stop now i don't want to cry ;) thanks in advance for the people reading this.
nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide
i often fantasize about dying. i don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is i don't want to do that to my parents. besides feeling like i just want to be dead, i also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. i can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and i'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what i do, nothing fills it. i tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. i told him about my self harm and how i just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the right way if i wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said i have a lot to be happy for. it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, i don't think i want to die. i just wish everything would stop and i could start over as someone else. and honestly, when i think about killing myself, i fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, i know.i think the main reason i want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that i'm not just faking it or choosing to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering i want to do it literally to get their attention. but i just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, i need to show it to people somehow.
the only existence sadder than being suicidal is being suicidal but with the option of suicide taken away from you because if you were to kill yourself, you would kill someone else too
i dont think my mom would be able to survive me dying
telling someone not to kill themselves seems as useful as telling a serial killer not to kill you. :d
also, stop telling people think about your family. think about what it's doing to me to continue being here. think about how it is to feel trapped almost everywhere you go. yeah, to suffer through that constantly? no.
being born ugly sets you up to fail
they say looks don’t matter, but unfortunately that isn’t true. for some of us, the amount of grooming, styling and exercising we do just can’t fix bad genes. while adults may not judge someone on face value if they are unattractive, being made fun of as a kid leads to a chain of effectsget made fun for appearance as a kid/teen...don’t have anyone to hang with...shattered confidence...staying home on weekends and not talking much during school...not developing social skills...being socially inept as an adultmost of my quirks are in my bone structure so it would take some serious plastic surgery to address them. i’m so angry at myself for skipping on an opportunity to fix a very big flaw with my appearance 5 years ago because some yes-men convinced me i was okay. i’m not.
i hate that i can’t kill myself
i just want to disappear. i don’t want to die, i want to stop existing. dying involves violently ending your life. and leaping into the void of death, not knowing what exactly will happen. i just want to stop existing and to be forgotten.i’m stuck and i hate it so much.
my dad recorded a video of me walking down the street
he showed it to me on his pc, showing my hands in my pockets, my head down, obviously looking quite dead-faced. telling me he showed this to me to show what u look like to the rest of the world, an overweight loser who will never get anothet girlfriend stuck in his own thoughts. i feel so weird and dirty that. i was recorded the one time i wasn't putting on a front, pretending i had my shit together head held up high. maybe it's his fucked up way of trying to motivate me to sort my shit out but it just makes me wish i could stop existing. i fucking hate myself more. my family obviously hates me, maybe if i go they will feel sad for a bit but then as time goes on they'll forget about me. i know a spot off the local trail, maybe tonight, i'm not yet sure  i want this pain in my head to go away. i'm sick of feeling stuck
does anyone else ever think to themselves “any day now i’m going to kill myself”
i just feel like i’m constantly on some sort of pin and needle. just no way in hell i can survive anymore. each day is the same boredom and misery. prison. let me out. i just don’t see where it’s worth it. i’m not super talented so the creative ability necessary to better myself isn’t there. self destructive plagues always end up fucking me up
for once, i just want to stop being the punchline of everyone's jokes.

i feel like an npc in a world filled with players. i’m just created to commit suicide and i can’t change the settings to stop that.

can we not gatekeep suicidal depression?
hello. i had an interesting conversation with another redditor the other day from my post. i was gonna attempt and this person tried to talk me down, only to get agitated at me and say,” you’re only attention seeking and wasting good people’s time.” like isn’t the point of this subreddit to be a bit attention seeking? i wanted someone to talk me out of it. but don’t tell me that i’m not suicidally depressed, you don’t fucking know me and what i’m going through. you shouldn’t have that attitude if you’re trying to help people on here. thank you all, i hope you have a good day.
its 1 am and i dont want to sleep because i'm not ready to wake up and deal with another fucking day.
anyone else procrastinate going to sleep so you can lay in bed and have more of the sweet silent calm darkness?
anyone else’s suicidal thoughts get triggered by the smallest things?
i don’t even want to write out the small things that happen because they sound so stupid when i look back on them, but 9 times out of 10 they just result in me crying and wanting to die maybe im just weak and pathetic
i am the kid that tries to join your friend group but fails. i am the kid that can’t take a hint. i am the kid that no one likes. i am the weird kid. i want to die.
so i have always been that weird kid who kinda tries to join a friend group and they hint they don’t like you but your motivated to join anyways. i’m super weird. everyone thinks i’m annoying. and it goes much deeper than that. yes. there are some parts of my life such as family that i’m lucky for. but i just wish i was with different people. i want to die. why was i put on this world if my only purpose was to be called names, bullied, have no friends, and be the most annoying person on planet earth. why did they do this. please help me. i’m so tired of me giving in and asking to be invited to things and trying to be friends but they won’t give back. i have tried with everyone. i’m tired and crying. and i don’t wanna die before 16 but i think i should. i don’t know what to do and i’m crying as i write this. why. why
mental illness is bullshit
life is shit. the world is going to hell. we're slaves to our wages. there's no fucking point to anything and it's got nothing to do with mental health. the world is just shit and i want nothing to do with it. i'm not fucking sick. i'm sick of people telling me i'm sick in a piece of shit world that's sick. if anything, i see the world better than most. there's really no point to be here. why prolong this endless suffering? if anyone says i'm selfish, they're the fucking selfish ones for wanting me to be here only to help them while i fucking suffer every moment. fuck everything.
well guys, i’m alive
i stayed up the whole night last night going back and forth with my bottle of pills. i guess i won.
i jumped off a (small) bridge
surprise! i lived. the water was quite a bit deeper than i thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. i went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. i still got a concussion just from the water (fyi, concussions suck. do not recommend). and after i somehow managed to not drown anyway, i swam to shore. holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. believe it or not, i didn’t think it was that big a deal. it didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. more like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. before the jump i had figured a ~90% chance i’d live if the water was deep (i was gambling a lot on that “if”). when i got home i told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. nope. not a chance. we went *straight* to the er. then i was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. the psych ward. i was pretty terrified. i didn’t think i was worthy of such care. my issues were mild, weren’t they? it was just (extreme) self harm. i spent five days in the hospital. and frankly they were some of the most incredible days i’ve ever experienced in my life. i dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. at several points, i *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. but they didn’t do that to me. they talked to me, and they helped me. they gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. somehow, they got me to admit that i *wanted* to live, even though i desperately believed i didn’t deserve to. i’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that i *do* deserve to live. anyway... that’s kinda my little story. tl;dr: jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! i’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when i get a chance.edit 2: this got a bit more attention than i thought, but i’m glad. if this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, i’ll be overjoyed.
waking up is “ oh please not again” then waiting till it’s dark again. repeat.

wrote this while sitting on a bridge looking down
each night like this. i just want to slip into the water. and come up in a new place. and breath a different air. in a world far from here.
i think my depression is passing
i'm not sad all the time anymore, my suicidal thoughts have gone, no more urges to cut, my psychosis is kind to me, homocidal ideation is gone. i feel great, happy i'm making it through one of the hardest times of my life.
why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isn't that great for some people?
some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. to the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.i've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. on the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, i don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. i'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.but guess what the worst thing of all is? you have a *survival instinct.* living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. you don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.so, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. you just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.the thing is, too, i bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.so, fuck it.
do you ever feel so lonely your chest physically hurts?

please, at least read the last few sentences
this is a lot to read. so if you don't want to read it all, then please just read the last few sentences. you can even ignore the link.&#x200b;i don't know why i keep writing these. there must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. it's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. we expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. that's just how things are normally. it's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? if you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. we only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.&#x200b;i find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. i don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.it's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. but not the emotionally damaged.&#x200b;so why do i keep writing these? desperation, probably. i know full well that, even under the banner of suicide watch, most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. i'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? how many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? will this be my final message to the world?like i said; i don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. we die as a last resort to end our suffering. at the same time, i don't think any of us live just to live. we *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. yet we're told not to die because it's better to live. even if that means living in misery.&#x200b;it's at this point that i realize i'm only writing for myself. i'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but i'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't i?i dunno.&#x200b;i opened this with the intent on explaining why i feel suicidal. *my* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). but i've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.&#x200b;if someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out.if someone is reading this; i'm scared. i'm scared that i won't be able to hold this off anymore. so i'll just imagine that i'm not alone. that maybe this message connects us.i'll just pretend that someone is reading this. so, just in case i can't hold on, i won't be alone in the end.thank you.
i almost died yesterday
i almost did it yesterday. i skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and i planned to end my life. i tied the noose and i jumped from a tree. miraculously my neck didn’t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down. in that second that i was hanging from the tree all i could think about was how much of a mistake it was. i spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and i realized that life has its ups and downs but that’s what life is, you gotta live through the pain because it’s all experiences, not good or bad experiences, just experiences. thank you, mike, if you are reading this. 
i tried to hang myself, the belt broke.
i stood on that chair for what felt like forever. some part of me was waiting for someone to come stop me, tell me how stupid i was and that my life was worth living. nobody stopped me. nobody cared. so i stepped off the chair, and felt the belt squeeze around my neck. i blacked out within a couple seconds. and what they say about “how everyone’s final thoughts are that they wish they didn’t do it” it’s bullshit. my last thoughts were of relief. anyway, i woke up on the floor feeling woozy, and i didn’t even remember i had just tried to kill myself. this is the closest i’ve come to ending my own life. i just can’t exist anymore.
i just called the hotline and got hung up on. talk about feeling alone
he answered and said his name. i said hello kevin, how are you. he asked how i was i said “okay, i’m very sad” and i got the dial tone. thank you very much, kevin.
my parents asked me to kill myself
i have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out. so i reached out to my parents after a meltdown. its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues. i don't share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them. anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about. my own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y don't i do it if i really am depressed. great solution actually. now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally. maybe i won't be a liar anymore...maybe i can finally find peace
i just want to die in my sleep.

i tried to kill myself.
not today, not yesterday, 9 years ago. no one knows. no one noticed. i took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around. adderal, percocet, sleeping pills, and allergy meds were among them. i don’t know what else. there were more than four bottles. it was just whatever i could find. i swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. let a few dissolve on my tongue because i liked the sickening feeling they induced. i thought that would be enough. after a few minutes of nothing happening, i swallowed more. got dizzy. struggled to make it to the couch. passed out. i was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. they walked by me and didn’t notice. i still remember it all vividly and think of it often. i had no regrets. i wanted to die. waking up, realizing i was still alive, that was the worst feeling i’ve ever felt. it put me in a daze. i’ve felt on pause ever since. i often regret not dying. i feel like i should be dead. i feel like a large part of me did die that day. the only reason i didn’t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying. i knew i couldn’t go through that again and didn’t have other resources i felt were adequate. i dropped out of school shortly after. i stopped leaving my house. i see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it. i don’t have that. life hasn’t gotten better. i just wanted to tell someone.
killing myself on jan 1st 2020
my parents found out i have depression, now my mom is treating me differently while my dad takes on a more gentler and understanding approach. my mom is guilt tripping me and telling me to kill myself, she wouldn't care she said. so i was deeply hurt, i recently purchased a rope 2 hours ago online. i'm planning to write goodbye letters next to my ex-boyfriend who i always loved, my friend who i drifted apart with but our memories together haunts me, my best friends who stuck around me and helped me get better, which vainly failed. and of course, my dad, i love my dad very much. i already wrote a will 2 months ago. i told my classmates about my plan, and they all tried their best to make me feel better. i love them so much, but if i have to endure the pain everyday at home being discriminated and bullied by my mom... i just can't...&#x200b;honestly, fuck 2019.&#x200b;edit: 16/12/2019thank you for the people who showed concern, it made me rethink if i want to go through it or not. i just feel this way because everyday feels like hell and why even bother going on if everyone around you, including your old friends are happy.
why does living with depression just feel like a series of necessary distractions?
every single damn day i have to find at least one thing to distract me from the fact that i want to die. i don't want to hurt.  i don't want to suffer. i don't want to take anyone with me in the process.i don't want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury. i don't want to hurt the ones who care about me, either.  like my parents. i love them. but i am just so damn tired of living.  it would be so nice if i could just fall asleep and not wake up.  how nice it must be to not have depression. to not want to die.  i can't imagine how nice it must be going a day without fighting my own self...
i wish i could give someone else my life
some people are fighting to live , they are fighting death every day , it amaze me , wish i can appreciate being able to live but instead i wish to die as soon as possible
sick of hearing ‘it gets better’
i don’t care!! i’m not only suicidal for my ‘temporary’ problems, i find life in general as simply meaningless and pointless. even if things got better i wouldn’t want to live on this shitty planet, we all die in the end anyway. and my chronic pain isn’t gonna get better ever. i don’t want to change the world and i don’t care if people have it worse, so stop trying to guilt me.
i'm lucky enough to have a few people in my life who care so much for me that sometimes it actually hurts. i don't want them to wake up one day to find me dead. even if right now i can't live for myself, i will try for them.

i hate that you can’t even mention suicidal thoughts because everyone will freak out
even if you have them and know you won’t act on them. i get in phases where every time something upsets me i have very graphic images of all the ways i could kill my self. my ocd urges it on, and my irrational side tries to tell me it’s the best option. i have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option, though, even if i have doubts that i’ll ever be “happy.”but i can’t say this to anyone because they’ll freak out. they’ll think they should call a hospital, or tell someone in my family, or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes. and all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside.edit: this is my first time posting here and i am overwhelmed that my post has resonated with so many other people here. i hope to hear from more people. please pm me or /u/ me in a comment if you’re interested in talking about something in particular (like someone mentioned ocd and intrusive thoughts).
i don’t want to get “help”
no i don’t want to get better. in fact i want to get worse. i want to get so bad that i have no choice but to kill myself. why would i want to get better if i want to die? getting “better” will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where i still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and i’m sorry but that’s the opposite of what i want. i don’t want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that i should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades. death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life. medication and therapy might minimize it but it’ll never truly go away. the longer i’m alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do.
my daughter (14f) tried to kill herself last night
to put it simply, i am so lost. this is the second time she has done something suicidal and i have tried my hardest to be there for her every step of the way. there are so many factors that go into this that i could type (on mobile) until my thumbs hurt. i am hurt. i don’t know how to trust her. it sucks so bad i just want to be there for her and twice now i have been informed by second parties that this has happened. i found her in the garage last night after taking a handful of pills. she was scared said she thought she was a freak. i told her i loved her no matter what. i consoled sisters and called grandmas so i could meet her and her mom at the hospital.  i told her i loved her, and now everything today is like normal. i am hurt. i am so hurt and i don’t want to put that on her. but i am tiered of emotional pep talks, and it hurt to know everything i’ve ever said to her didn’t help. i’m sorry for this thread.i’m honestly overall just sorry.
i cant stop crying
my cat died. he was the last thing i had and he's gone now and i don't have anything holding me back from the edge. i just wanted something to say goodbye to.
does anyone else think about suicide every few seconds?
it's constantly on my mind. it doesn't matter what i'm doing. if i'm at work, or home or outside. the thoughts are always there. i'm talking about literally every 10-20 seconds i think about killing myself.
do you ever realize how easily you can exit someone's life?
it's so strange, in under a year i've come to realize how easy it is to slip out of someone's life no matter how much you cared for each other before. it's comforting to think that these people will be (are?) okay without me, so nothing will be selfish about my suicide.edit: thank you stranger for silver, & to everyone else who understands this. every you matter and you don't realize how much they care actually is very kindhearted of you to say but untrue in my circumstance unfortunately.
i fucking hate my birthday
you don't give a shit about me the rest of the year why do you pretend to care about me now ?? every year it's the same and every year it's just a reminder that i haven't killed myself yet
i'm 15 years old, i will kill myself next week. i need help. i need to feel that somebody understands me.
hi, for the people worrying, i have made a post with an update, i am so thankful for your support i love you all:please trust me, i am trying to describe my feelings in this post for almost 3 hours now. i need to post this. i will edit this tomorrow and do a whole story i just need somebody to know this. i don't want to die.
i killed my girlfriend, and now i want to kill myself..
 before you read my true story, i want you to know that i'm not very good at english, as it's my second language so bare with me if i have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly i really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.anyway,this one random late night in march 2017, i decided to download the tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but i'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but i was on it to find true love. fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or i was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day i got super liked by this girl named laura. we both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. it had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and i felt a real connection between us two. we both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. it was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and i was a ugly mf. she came from a small town family, where as me, i was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).after the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. like when i say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. i dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. and some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, i only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. one thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like i had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. anyway that just made me like laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and i was always curious to know more about her.we ended up dating for 6 months, and i knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who i was, i didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like i did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch i was. everything was going well, till (jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. laura was going through some tough times, but i was always with her, trying to make her strong. she would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. but no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that i would always be with laura, and i wanted to marry her.we got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of march, i proposed to her, i honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but i felt like i needed to tell her that i'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that i thought she would break my bones, but i knew that this meant a lot to her.april 11th 2018.this part is going to be hard for me, as i am typing my fingers are twitching, i'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... anyway, on this very day, i picked up laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. after this moment, i don't remember a thing. it felt like i died, i could hear my surroundings but i couldn't see anything, idk how long or anything i woke up and the first thing i asked was what happened to laura? and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. i kept asking, and no one replied. then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. it all happened in a flash of a second.. the love of my life was gone, and i could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. i only had minor injuries, but i was mentally dead.fast forward to a month, i still was in shock, infact i still am.. i went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. a week later, i found out that laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, i didn't go to laura's too because i couldn't accept it but my mum told me that i had to go to comfort her mum. but laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and i honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day i felt that i could have done better, i could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe i could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. i know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro but i could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. i honestly have no hope for life, i just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, i just hope i die real soon.... it's not that i want sympathy but i just can't deal with it, it hurts.
i'm still here
2019 was filled with 3 suicide attempts and 4 hospitalizations. i'm pretty sure i spent almost all of my year wishing i was dead. despite this, i'm getting better. i'm finally on meds. i've reconnected with old friends, and became much more social. there are some days where i feel like giving up, but i know i'm stronger than my thoughts. i'm managing, i hope you are too. please stay safe.
it sucks so bad when you have a bunch of great days in a row, and you feel like you’re making a ton of progression on your mental health and outlook and life in general. then 1 bad thing happens and you’re back to feeling worthless

sometimes i wish i didn't have people who would be affected by my hypothetical suicide.

the gun jammed
the title says it all. a little over a week ago, i put a shotgun barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger. it didn't go off. the fucked up part is that i'm just sitting frustrated about why it didn't go off. i saw my therapist last saturday and told him about it. he asked if i was willing to bring the gun to him for safe keeping. i complied. later that day i checked myself into an urgent psychiatric center and they almost kept me. they prescribed zyprexa instead and after telling my story, the psychologist started crying. that didn't help. the zyprexa has made me feel numb. i'm not sad, and i'm not happy. i don't want to be alive anymore, or rather, i simply wished i didn't exist. just needed to get that out. to anyone that reads this, thank you.
attempted suicide a few hours ago and i'm shook and so scared.
i've been at my all time rock-bottom for the past few days and i've been crying every night. it all accumulate this morning when i tried handing myself after my parents left for work. it's left me absolutely shook. even writing this i'm shaking and my breathing is unnatural. i'm so scared, i'm really fucking scared. this is my first attempt so i've never felt anything like this before, the tears, the shaking, all of it. i can't stop crying, i can't believe this is real. who knows if i'm gonna even be here next week, the way things are going i'm unsure, and this frightens the hell out of me.i've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as i stopped i instantly when back into my depressive state. i don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. so i haven't been back and i don't plan too. if you've read this far, thank you so much for hearing me out, i just had to say this, i feel sick after what's happened.much love to everyone out there. together, we'll get through this, all of us.edit: thanks to everyone who took the time to read this and especially to those kind hearted and uplifting comments. i am pretty worried about everything that's been going on with myself but reading the comments has helped to calm me down immensely. honestly i can't thank you enough.
but you are so attractive you have no reason to have social anxiety and depression.
i know it's not the correct sub but why the hell do so many fuckheads say that shit?* yes i have a mirror* yes i care about my hygiene and looks because i learned it that way and it's hard to dislearn something like eating with a fork and knife* yes i hit the gym every other day but it's one of the hardest steps i take since 3 yearsbut why the fuck does that have something to do with my mental health?i'm a male and it's already hard af to hide your feelings in public because of social pressure (at least in germany) but shit like that is driving me mad if people think that being attractive makes you imune against depression and so on.&#x200b;has anyone ever encountered shit like that?
goodbye
\*\*update: i didn't do it. i made myself go to sleep. i didn't get all my letters/goodbyes done the way i needed to. right now i feel empty, in a daze. i know i will lose this battle one day, but i'm kinda glad it wasn't last night. also, thanks to all the people who commented that they care, means so much.\*\*hopefully, this is my last post. i'm not posting this for attention or pity, it's merely to show i was here, i was a person.right now nothing and everything hurts at the same time. i can't breathe, i can't stop crying. why am i this weak, it's a disgrace to humankind.i can't take this anymore. i'm sorry to all the people i love, even if the love was not returned.thanks for the memories life. goodbye.sj 1998-2019
i wish there was a reset button for life.
i wish
nobody genuinely wants to help you in the real world
if you start getting depressed or lash out, first thing they'll think of you is you are dangerous. they'll look for a solution in mental institutions, medicine, restraining - anything to keep you from doing harm. they'll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts. to them, you should suffer in silence and never exist.the stories in the movies, books, etc. are all wrong. humans are selfish, first and foremost. jesus does not exist in real life. and no, he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments. nobody will, that's why it's just a myth.to them, you're just an animal. a human turned into a zombie, that needs to be taken out. your emotions aren't valid responses to your environment. to them, you are broken.
i asked last saturday if anyone there ? you answered. thank you. i was half way through my suicide attempt.
i was on this site last week and need someone that i didn't know.  i'm not doing well lately. i have a toxic abusive relationship, i cannot find a shrink to save my life (literally. ha), i'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), i'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.i had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  i took a medication to make it so i wasn't scared to do it. in the closet i was in, i had my phone, i'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. i wanted to go forward.  i can't now, but think if it were again ... i would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. i wouldn't wake up again. i am still ok with that idea.i stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that i was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  it didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. i put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. i called my husband (stbx) and was taken by ambulance.  i was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. everything is locked up, i have no access to anything. i don't have my car. i'm safe.but thank you. i wanted to tell someone what happened. i need to feel less confused about it and why or if i'm a risk, or if i'm being dramatic. i can't tell. but i can't talk about it at home. i'm sad and embarrassed to be here.  edited to remove specific methods of suicide attempt.
im alive. but i'm not living.
i'm present. i'm physically here.and that's where it ends.
am i the only one whose not excited for upcoming decade??
i really feels so sad. i tried to do some hobbies and play games. i feel so tired hanging out with people. reasons why i don’t want to celebrate christmas and new year anymore. for me, it feels like bullsh*t faking your happiness.
i tried to hang myself and i’m not handling it well
yesterday i tried to hang myself from a bridge with a belt and when i jumped i instantly regretted it. i fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail, but the belt was chocking me. i tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me. eventually my arms gave out and i started to dangle and suffocate. i saw people in my life that had died and i saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes. right as i was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. it was my last strength. i pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that i was parallel with the bridge. this gave me room to breath again. i swung my arm up and around the rail so that i could attempt to take the belt off and i knew i only had one shot at this. i was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and i dropped into the water. the next day (or today) i have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other ptsd symptoms and i’m not sure how i can deal with it. anyone have anything that could help?
i told my mom for the first time that i tried to commit suicide
she yelled at me, then i told her that i'm sure i have depression, she doesn't believe and i can't stop crying.
depression ruined my personality and my mind
edit: if you see this please switch to the “new” filter on the sw homepage and refresh, and comment on those latest posts. you might just be the help they need! thank you everyone for reaching out and making me feel less alone. i’m overwhelmed by all the positive responses. i guess not all people are malicious after all. keep spreading the love ❤️depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. but the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. now i lost my mind. now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. i had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and tv.then i grew up and i lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. i wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. i was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. i was that guy. i was born to be that guy.but depression fucked me. and for the past 5 years i had set the goal to become that person again. the real me. but i have not only failed but i have rotten even further. depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.i lost 2 women i truly loved due to my depression. due to them thinking that i was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out i had nothing to talk about, i wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. it's my worst nightmare come true. people ditching and telling me i'm uninteresting. this was not supposed to be my life. i deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. i persevered. i don't accept this anymore. i tried to change but it doesn't work. i can't read anymore. my brain is fucked and i've literally lost so many iq points that i don't understand what people tell me. my brain is too slow. and while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so i can't connect them and comprehend the story. i live in the moment. i can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. i lost my creativity. my ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. she is my female version. i am her. and she is exactly the person i wanted to be. maybe that's why i love her so much. and as mad and hurt as i am for the way she treated me, i really can't blame her for not wanting me. i wouldn't want this me either. but it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. i know how my life would have turned out without the depression. its so fucking painful. a family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. it was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.&#x200b;i have become a stupid dumb ass uncultured loser and i deserve to die. i deserve my peace. this is not me. you can have my life. i don't want it anymore. i am in hell and i want this to end.
i almost killed myself
but i didn’t. yay? i guess?i almost drove off the cliff. i was so close to doing it. but i sat in my car and i screamed, “just go home. just go home. just go home. just go home.”until i made it home. and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed.when i went inside, i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath.the next day, my best friend took me out to eat. i told her i almost did it. and she said “i could tell a few days before that you were off. and i didn’t say anything. i’m sorry, i should have. i didn’t want you to feel like i was smothering you.” but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it. i have a great support system, but i’m just living with this mental illness. it hurts. my life is so good, but i’m just sick.
everyone wants you to do something, but noone wants to help you in person.
that's how it is. it's all a lie, all pretending, all fake.&#x200b;if you'll ever go to a psychiatrist...if you'll ever go to a therapist...if you'll ever go to a psychologist...or even if you ever come across some random on the internet, or in real life...&#x200b;they are all smart asses, all knowing, but not even one of them will ever give you a hand. it's like coaching. giving worthless advice.&#x200b;poor? get a job.sad? find happiness.lonely? meet people.&#x200b;wow, really? wow, thank you so much, i didn't know it's that simple! wow! thank you my savior. i'll be rich now, happy, and have plenty of friends. i was so stupid, thank you for showing me the way.&#x200b;that's the point, that's the key. 32 fucking years, and you dare to say me, do something?!&#x200b;a drowning man will clutch at a straw, but you first need to give them one.a lot of people could be saved if they had anyone by their side, cut the bullshit, and chit chat. if you're not here with me, then just fuck off. i don't need no imaginary fake friends. i wouldn't mind friends with benefits though, at least there would be benefits, obviously.
have you ever been stuck in a cycle of “i want to live and give a big fuck you to people who kicked me when i was down,” to “i want to kill myself to prove a point” to “nobody gives a shit about me enough for either of those things to happen?”
i am leaning far more towards the last two. 
i've become so accustomed to the fact that i'm going to kill myself that other people's struggles with suicide don't register to me much
because i think about it so much i just see them as another person like me. it also makes me feel like everyone is like me, so if i went to kill myself and people were around nobody would care.
i wish someone would shoot me to death.
this morning my dad went on a rant about how people who don't add anything to society should die. all i could think about is how that's just me. i'm useless. i'm unwanted. i might not be a convicted criminal, but i'm definitely never going to be useful to society. i don't agree with him in any other case, but in my case... yeah. i should be killed. i can't get enough courage to do it myself, but i still very much want it to happen. i can't see a day when i'll not be like this. useless and suicidal. these are just two things that i'm meant to be. i don't want to be them, but here i am. kill me please.
everyone wants me get help so i don't kill myself but nobody wants to talk to me and help me by just talking to me

i'm deciding not to take my life.
i feel like shit, i'm broke, i'm failing and i'm depressed, but fuck it, i'm not killing myself, i'm gonna workout every single day until i become a bodybuilder, and i'm gonna just fight this battle.
depression has killed my brain
literally.i can't learn or understand new things. i dont even understand basic and simple shit. it's so fucking frustrating, especially when people call me out for the retarded shit that i do and i can't even understand that. i can't do anything anymore. my life is completely devoid of meaning.i'm thinking about dying, but i just dont know yet.
best friend killed himself, i want to join him
my best friend killed himself at the end of september, and i still can't handle it. i'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.he was the most amazing person i had ever known, and he told me once last june about his plans to commit suicide. i tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. i know that, as i was at the time, i couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. he was the only one who would or could help.i called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. how am i ever going to find a guy like him again? i loved him, but i never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.i've cried every night since he died, wishing i could join him in death. i can't feel anything for anyone else. he made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way i never thought was possible. now he's gone...forever. i'm such a failure. i failed him. i never made him feel like he made me feel. he used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that i was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. now, i pretend my pillow is his hand as i cry myself to sleep.i failed him. i was insecure and had intimacy issues, and i never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. he was everything. he had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. when i told him my father had sexually abused me, i expected him to run for the door. instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that i was still beautiful to him. i'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.i can't exist without him. i reach my arms out into the air sometimes when i'm trying to fall asleep, hoping i can feel his arms around me again. why didn't i tell him that i loved him? why did i assume i would see him again? i feel so guilty. i just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. he gave the best hugs in the world.i just want to die and be with him again. i want to tell him that i love him.shane...i love you. i'm so sorry you died alone, and that i wasn't there. i'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because i do. if only i had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. i'm sorry. i love you with all of my heart. i know you wanted me to live, but i can't without you. you were the only one for me, but i was too stupid to let you in. i'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time i've called you that.- cassie
who else feels like they're only still living to spare the feelings of their family members?
there's nothing in my life worth living for anymore. everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone. i'm disabled, in poor health, i suffer abuse on a daily basis and i feel totally alone in this world. it would be a relief to be able to just stop existing. the only thing preventing me is the fact that i have 1 or 2 family members who i feel would be deeply affected if i were to check out on them. so i suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings. anyone else in a similar situation?
suicide is like a security blanket
the thought of suicide always gives me relief whenever i feel like everything is going wrong. i could easily get rid of myself and i would no longer have to participate in this shit existence. i can’t imagine actually growing old. i don’t understand how others can magically plan out their lives while actually having real goals for themselves and not once think about harming or killing themselves. it’s so foreign to me.
i should have killed myself in high school
i was a fool to think that things would change and that i would actually feel better when i reach college. i was so fucking wrong it’s not even funny.life only gets worse from here. i don’t want to be alive to see how it gets worse.if i had known i would still feel this way by the time i got to college i would have hung myself freshman year of high school
alone
we hug goodbye at the airport. you make your way to your boyfriend, waiting for you upstairs and i get into my cab. you're going home where you'll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend. i'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so i don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. i'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. i won't think about tomorrow, how i'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. i won't wonder if i'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. while your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, i'll turn on the tv because the silence kills me. it's not that i resent that you have people. i just wish i wasn't so alone. i wish i didn't go back to an empty house all the time, i wish there was someone to say welcome home. i wish that it isn't just google for me to talk to at home. when i'm sick, i become so vulnerable. broken body, broken spirit. the loneliness eats up at me even more and i wish i could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. watch as the pain flows out of my veins.i want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. feel myself sway in the wind till i find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as i become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. the wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. i want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. to feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. the demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions. if i have to be alone tonight, i wish it could be for the last time.edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger!! and thank you everyone for your kind words. i'm glad my piece connected with you all and sorry you feel such loneliness too.
if i test positive, i’m going to kill myself.
i’m getting tested on saturday. it’s been a rough life, i cant finish highschool, my anxiety for testing for hiv is sky rocket, and i feel like a failure. nothing in my life is going my way and i’m only 18. i havent been taking my meds (stupid i know) so i constantly worry about everything, and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof. i was sexually assaulted in june, he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone i trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me.i’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and i’m scared to have sex again because i’m afraid that my rapist gave me hiv. i will never live with myself and i can’t tell my friends or the boy i’m talking to. i have nobody, no support and i’m afraid to go get tested on saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.  if the test results come out positive, it’s the end for me bc nobody will love me and i’m just a dirty worthless piece of shit. i wish i never existed. and i’m in so much agony and pain and stress, my (then clear) face is breaking out and making me feel even worse.i don’t know what to do and i’m scared and i feel hopeless. i feel like death is my only way out.update 9/6/19: so today i found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant. and he already has a kid. so he has two kids now. my anxiety is a little calm now because i’m sure if he had hiv they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother, she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is. but it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. i could’ve been that pregnant girl. i hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable std. but that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now i don’t love it anymore. i’m still disgusted by my body now and i feel dirty ashamed.i wish this would all end. i think i might kill myself soon. i can’t focus on life rn when all of this is happening.
any body else feel, stressed/anxious /guilty/hopeful /hopeless /scared/sad /suicidal /all in around a 24 hour period give or take?

happy people telling you to just be positive
fuck them. they have it all sorted out. they don't know what loneliness is, what depression is, what anxiety is.
i started going to bed early
its so much easier to avoid people when i'm asleep. the last three nights i've gone to bed at 7:30. i just want to sleep forever.
isolation really messes you up. i don’t even feel human anymore, i can’t articulate myself at all anymore, not even whilst talking to myself. just emptiness and pain.

i tried to commit suicide today
the gun jammed... i dont know why,its like it didnt want me to die
i'll be ignored again...
nobody is going bother reading this but thank you if you do. i'm tired of being invisible. i just want to be cared. i'm tired of looking at an empty notifications screen. i don't remember the last time i went out with someone. everyone around me is enjoying their lives except me. i don't want to wake up ever again if this is what it will be like for rest of my life.
it's a vicious cycle when you feel like your wasting your 20's away but you don't have the will power to change it. when you'd rather die than see yourself waste away your young life.

i wish i would die in my sleep
i don't plan to commit suicide(i'm afraid that i might survive the methods and then i would be worse off), but every night i wish i would die in my sleep and every morning i'm disappointed i'm still alive.
i'm happy this sub reddit exists
it feels so nice that i'm not alone.i know i'm not the first person to kill myself and i won't be the last. but it feels good that other people are having the same thoughts in this moment.
i feel so alone i just wish i had someone to hug me

suicide is becoming a more and more attractive option each passing day.
i don’t know what to say except that. i’m so fucking done. i’m not going to do it and i don’t plan to. but, even when i tell myself tomorrow is going to be a better day, it just isn’t and killing myself seems more and more an actual option.
do you guys fantasize about your suicide?
i think about it a lot. like i imagine how it'll play out. who would find me, the mess it would make, how my apartment would likely smell of my decomposing corpse and how that would likely give away what actually happened. the process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through. my co workers finding out, how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming. do you guys go through the same thing?
i hate my life. i hate myself. i wish i wasn’t alive. the only reason i want to stay alive is because of my family. i don’t want to hurt them but why should i endure so much pain in exchange for my family being happy? i can’t stand the thought of hurting my mom but i don’t want to do this anymore.

does anyone else feel empty, all the time?
i can't find anything that i enjoy doing anymore, everything just feels empty. i almost don't even feel human anymore.
suicide is a solution to a permanent problem
i’ll always be alone no matter what i try to do. rejection hurts far too much and i’d rather be dead then have to experience it hundreds of times over and over again. i’d rather die than have to live life forever alone. i don’t give a shit if i’m young. i’d rather live a short life than live a long life of pain, misery and loneliness that only ends when i die of old age. i regret choosing not to kill myself in high school. the pain only persists and gets worse
i hate this world so fucking much! everyone helps only those who least need it! the poor grow poorer and the rich get richer! fuck this!

no offense but i rather kill myself while i am in my 20s than wasting my entire life working for the success of someone else-barely surviving in this cruel world .

the fear isn’t in dying. my fear is failing to commit suicide and the pain that i’ll feel as i try.
if i had a gun it would be easier, but my only options  all require pain. i just have to get past the pain part and i’ll be good to go.edit: i really don’t care for what comes after i die.  i just know that it’s better than dealing with what’s here for me. trust me, i’ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world, but it’s all been pointless. i have no fear of being dead; i just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing/avoiding pain. if there’s one thing in this life that i’m sure of, it’s that i want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. i think about it the majority of every day.the fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living. some of us have been beat down by life one too many times. i wish that was not the case, but unfortunately it is. it’s really saddening to see. but i sympathize because i feel the same.

suicide hotlines are bullshit
they ask you the same robotic questions a complete strangers asks when they find out you want to die. whether it’s texting or calling them it just feels awkward and i constantly have to watch what i say and lie otherwise i’ll have the police on my ass.
if only dying were as simple as pressing “shut down” like on a computer
so many years of pain i wouldn’t have to have lived through, so many more years i won’t have to be put through,jesus christ someone please just stop it all for me.
every day my desire for suicide increasessssssssss

i was born a hermaphrodite and i want to die because of it.
i don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. i've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and i have no idea if talking about it will even help. all of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition i was born with and how i've been treated because of it.based on what i know, when i was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically corrected into a female. my parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though i'm an adult. the only reasons i have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.nothing about my body is sexually correct. i have breasts, but i have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. i have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that i can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. i was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. it hurts a lot now, even as an adult. its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. i can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. i've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid i knew that certain things weren't right and that i didn't feel the way that other girls did. my parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.my parents were very rigid about gender roles when i was growing up and they punished me whenever i didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. most of my earliest memories are of me crying because i was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. i vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.when i got older, it just got worse. my parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought weren't for my gender. they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. they refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were girl colors. if i did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like you're not too old for us to spank you. when i turned 18 i started having serious medical problems. i ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries i was forced to have as a baby. i nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. i didn't get diagnosed until i was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that i had to quit school and my job. i went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that i was abnormal. i felt like a complete idiot when she told me. my parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and i was raised in such a strict religious environment that i sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.and i felt so broken and stupid then. i was so scared of what would happen that i didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. i had been dating my boyfriend for years already and i was so scared to tell him that i waited months before i said anything to him either. i just feel like such a failure. i was never even remotely happy as a woman, but i know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. and i've never felt like a man in the first place. i've always felt like i was something between that, even as far back as i can remember. but i know that people could never understand that. even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.i feel so completely alone in the world. i feel mutilated. i feel like a disappointment to my family because i can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. i can't take the pain anymore either. i'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. i've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. i just want it to end. no more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. no more feeling like i'm a horrible mistake. and no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. i wish there were a way to fix this. i wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where i could have been myself. but now i feel so lost and alone that i don't even know who or what i am.
my secret suicidal thoughts are getting worse. it's getting harder to disobey. and i dont want to tell anyone
i'm one of those super annoying people pleaser types. i'm constantly doing favors. listening to other people's problems. and forever smiling and trying to keep the positive vibes going.i'm worse than just all that though. because im an airhead and i dont have good social skills. i'm always saying or doing something stupid. and it makes me more awkward. i act like it's all good and i'm happy and it doesnt phase me. but that is so far from the truth. every single day i'm plagued by thoughts of how weak i am and how i'm annoying and how i'm a bitch and i need to die over and over and over. which turns into i wanna kill myself over and over. it's getting worse every day. i dont expect help. i just needed a place to vent.
anyone else stuck with a permanent blank face with the only emotion being sadness and resentment?

i got a gun to kill myself and my parents found out about it before i could do it.
hello, everyone. pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.i'm a 17-year-old dude, i live somewhere in north africa, i've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. i'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying i've been dealing with since i was young, i don't really get bullied now but i can get verbally hurt as i can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. anyways, i didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. mostly, they get bored of me or i just push them away. i decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. but it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. i decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever i ate, etc.. a year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, i was diagnosed then with schizophrenia and severe depression, i began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and i wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., i was in the last year of high school and exams came so i stopped going to the psychiatrist. i got a really bad grade despite doing my best, i stopped taking my medications cold turkey. i went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. i was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. my plan was ruined and i'm under some kind of suicide watch. i really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to man up! and a lot of people are going through worse, i'm also kinda guilt-tripped.i just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my friends can't really be relied on, and i felt like taking this off my chest. thanks to whoever read the whole thing.
i'm jumping off a building in a few hours to end my pain.
i never knew the worst case of depression is when tears are no longer flowing in your eyes. since last month, i've been taking high dosages of antidepressants hidden from everyone but myself. i had no one to rely on, my bestfriend gets mad whenever i speak about my anxieties, saying that she's afraid to be with someone who is mentally and emotionally unstable. i can't speak to my parents about how i feel because they just tell me that everybody has problems and force me to keep going on with the routines i should be doing. i just want to shut down. i have no self-esteem left and i have never felt this way before. this is probably going to be my last reddit post. i left home earlier today ready to do this. i've been told that i'd go to hell when i die, perhaps it's time to go and check it out.
the love of my life killed himself three weeks ago
ive decided to go too. nothing makes sense in this world without him it feels like i can't breathe. i really just needed to tell someone before i do it. thank you all❤️
whoever says life is a gift can fucking catch these hands

it's not depression, my life objectively sucks
i'm 28, schizophrenic, probably autistic (can't get a diagnosis in ukraine), live with parents, still a virgin. we are poor, our apartment is falling apart. i used to make music, but not anymore because it gives me insomnia (a weird side effect of schizophrenia medication). my psychiatrist is uncooperative and nasty. i have to avoid anything exciting (like music), so i sleep 15 hours a day if i can and browse sad subreddits the rest of the time. can't focus on tv or books, feel restless because of the pills (a side effect that is more common than my weird music insomnia thing). i can't live like this.
my life consists of wanting to die everyday at some point.
i hate being alive. i want peace, i want death.
i plan my suicide 1-3 times per day
if i get an urge to end my life while i'm at work, out running errands, with friends, etc., i usually zone out without realizing and think through exactly how i can kill myself after i leave that function. e.g. i can go to this store for a rope but they close at 9, so i'll have to leave early, then i can go here, so on and so forth. does anyone else have this issue ? i'll usually zone out for 30 seconds or so and people are wondering why i look all spaced out
i don’t want to die. i just wish i had never existed in the first place

i’m sick of living. i feel like i’m just, done. my rapist gets away, i get called a liar. it haunts me in my dreams, and it haunts me when i’m awake. i try to bury that memory, but it’s impossible. i need help, but i’m too scared to seek it. i want to die, but i don’t want him to win.

do you ever just want to talk to someone about your suicidal feelings but then anxiety grabs you by the throat and chokes you until you have a breakdown?
i’m autistic so i’m very prone to the classic ‘autistic meltdowns’. i feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal, instead i’m viewed as very weird and obsessive.people in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays. i know if i were normal, i’d be happy and successful. no one will accept that my condition has made me a failure.yet i can’t talk about it to anyone about this, i just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds (nowhere near enough to kill me, but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard).i dunno, i’m a mess tbh! :)
its amazing how people act so attention-seekingly on social media when people die. its one of the reasons i wont kill myself.
the subject speaks for itself really. i just cant get over how so many f\*\*\*ing worthless maggots would try to make my suicide a big  deal for them. even in the face of the fact that none of them have have even cared the slightest bit about me or my wellbeing.f\*\*\* those people
im so fucking depressed to the point i even forgot why im depressed....does anyone feel the same way?
i swear to god my mind is playing tricks on melike really....i sometimes forget why the hell am i acting the way i do but then i remember why im this damn depressedsometimes i really feel gulity being suicidal...im not trying hard enough for the people begging me not to do it....you're not doing anything with your life,you drop out of school and now your just a piece of shit lying on bed all dayyour making your parents suffer with your weird behaviour, you did what you did because you are a lazy shit, you always say that life has no meaning yet you are not even trying to give it onefuck you you really should dieoh i remember now why i want to die...edit : oh god this is the first time having a reward on my post...thanks everyone for the responds thanks for explaing and relating to me,reading all the responds really cheered me up a bitlove yall
can you imagine being genuinely happy?
free of depression and all of your mental illnesses? just being completely normal and enjoying life and wanting to get old? seems so unreal to me
i'm a mother of two beautiful daughters, ive been married for 9 years. i'm 32 years old, i have a full time job, i eat right, i exercise, i drink water and i want to kill myself. being healthy doesn't make you happy.

therapy was the worst thing that happened to me
a few years ago when i was suicidal i was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. at the time, it made sense. but looking back i feel like such an idiot. as i got to the hospital i was honest about how i felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. the doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. the second they got me a wheelchair i knew my mistake. i shouldn’t have been honest at all. they all lied to me. there was no discussion, no prescription change. they locked me up in the hospital and for three days i didn’t even know how long i’d be there. when i finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. they were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis i told them i already had (episodic depression or major depressive? i forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what i do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one i already said i have, like it was new!!!! like they diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! one of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- i’m a woman) and i had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. it was so fucking weird. like they asked me who my support system was and i said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and guy” and they’re like who is guy!!!!!!!!!!! like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though i already said he’s a friend of mine. i had made some friends while i was in there. some i still keep in contact with. but worst was just that im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. i had nightmares for weeks. the anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. it sucked. it wasn’t worth it. i’ve learned to never tell a therapist you’re suicidal.
does anyone else have visual thoughts of their suicide?
i have suicidal thoughts daily and visualizations of killing myself for the past 6-7 years (i am 21)they're not really intentional just a reaction to the deep pain and stress i go through every single day of my life. it's a shitty learned hopelessness coping mechanism i've created to cope everytime something bad happens i can just see it
if anyone reads this thank you
i can't take it anymore. it's all so overwhelming & no one is listening. i've been practically alone my entire life, i dropped out of school in 8th grade because my anxiety was so severe i just couldn't couldn't go & no one cared enough to make me go. which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. honestly i cant even remember how to multiply or divide, it's humiliating. at that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  around this time i got really depressed & cried everyday for like 6 months. i barely ate & stayed inside my room all day with only a tv connected to a cable box to keep me company. i didn't see her much for a year after that. that is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that i'm in now. i think i've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because i've been mentally incapable of anything else. which means i can't drive, i don't have any friends, family or let alone a job. these are all things i've dreamt of practically all my life & they're so far away. it's becoming unbearable at this point. my mother & i aren't on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me & i called the cops on him. i don't have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends & i live in a small town without any real opportunity's available. i'm living off my mother & the minute she decides i have to go i'm going to be homeless. recently i've been begging her to take me to just get an id & help me apply for jobs. she keeps ignoring me & i know this is my problem but i don't have any money & i don't know what or how i'm supposed to do it. all i'm asking for is just a job so maybe i can figure things out but i can't even have that. i fucked up & now it's too late for me. my only option is suicide which is inevitable but i'm scared & i want to live.
in twenty six days, i am throwing a moving away party. i don't have the heart to tell my friends i am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move.
it's strange to me how happy i feel now that i've picked the date. i feel at peace with the idea, but i haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  the reasons why i'm suicidal and why i'm moving are really similar. i feel so broken and tired. i've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years i've been alive. it's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. whenever i seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. i'm a high functioning depressed person. i have an active social life. i have a good job. i have some good hobbies. i try to see a therapist and take medication. but deep down, there's a lot of darkness i carry. nobody knows at work that i constantly question how i should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. it's the first thought through my head when i wake up. when i've tried to open up to people, they treat me like i'm a burden or a liability. i feel so trapped in a persona that i've built for myself - i put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. i decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. but the big secret i carry is i don't want to start over.i've really struggled. i've taken countless meds, i've seen a therapist for over three years. i've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how i've been feeling. i'm really tired. i tried to kill myself when i was 12 and got hospitalized. i thought that was a low point i would rebuild from. six years later, when i was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. this year, i got diagnosed with bipolar ii. i'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. i don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.so in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. they'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. i think this is the time i'm going to do this. i could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. i don't want to live anymore. i love the people in my life so much, but i can't carry this anymore. i want to die so badly.  i know this will break some people close to me. that tears me up so bad. but in the end, this is something i need to do for myself.
i cried tonight realizing that suicide was not an option anymore
for most of my life, i have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much.  like a safety net... but the opposite.  in my mind i would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  i would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  it was a huge help.recently, i have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight i realized that if i was to end my life, it would completely break her.  so now, with great sadness, i have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector.  the future seems so much harder now.  thanks for listening.
does anyone else just wish someone would come up behind them and just shoot them in the head?
i want to die so beyond badly, but i dont have the courage to do it myself. i'm afraid of failing, becoming brain dead, becoming paralyzed, getting committed and losing my job, my boyfriend... i just wish someone would do it quick for me this way i wouldn't be scared or nervous about it. itd just finally be over. i'm such a coward...
ever feel like you weren't meant to be in this world?
i feel like i belong nowhere. a lot of the time, when i try doing something i always wanted to do, i ask myself after is that really it?. i feel like i should be in another world or something
anxiety mistaken for rudeness and disregard for respect. depression mistaken for laziness and not willing to put effort forward.
i'm 17. i'm gonna kill myself this year sometime this year. sometime soon. i didn't have a childhood yet i'm being thrown into adulthood as if i can handle it. i was never stable never since a child never since age 6 or 7. never fucking stable. i'm sorry i'm this way i didn't want to be. but fuck you for making this all about you. fuck you for putting it all on me as if i'm not affected by suicide attempt. by my mother practically abandoning me. by being left alone for years as a kid. as being bullied by my own family. by years of isolation of just wanting to straight up murder myself because that's so stupid. fuck everyone. fuck you. fuck family. fuck friends. fuck my boyfriend. go die and fuck yourselfedit: i thought this would go washed under new. maybe a few upvotes and a comment. but not this. thank you for making me feel heard for once.
it’s my 25th birthday
& ive never wanted to die more in my lifeedit: i had never been on this sub before. i typed suicide into the search bar after an intense breakdown. i wrote out my post and hit send. force closed the app. i went for a walk with my son who’s under one. i forgot i had even posted this till right now while i’m sitting on the toilet a day later. i’m currently bawling my eyes out in relief. i am curious about the future. today feels lighter than the societal pressures of yesterday. i am for lack of a better word overwhelmed by what an amazing community this sub is and i’m thankful for all of your support. please keep pushing one day at a time if you felt anything like i did yesterday. for those of you asking, yes i have been through a tremendous amount of difficult lessons as i’m sure many of you have. i’m currently watching my mother battle her bipolar disorder while trying to raise a child hoping this won’t be his future watching me. but being rational enough to know mental illness is a constant battle. thank you all again. i love myself. but i am exhausted. i feel as if i’m army crawling through life with bloody fingers.but i’ll keep on keepin on.
fuck this pointless world
who the fuck decided we needed 12+ years of school then you need to work a miserable job until you die.  same fucking routine every day, vacations once a year if you're lucky. how can people not be depressed? you're fucking brainwashed if you think that this is how life is supposed to be. 
does anyone get horrible, horrible heartache that literally is so physically painful?
when i'm sad, like really, really, sad, i get these sharp pains in my heart that are continuous and jerk tears. it hurts so much at times that it spreads throughout my body and i flinch and curl up in pain while my tears uncontrollably drop down my cheeks. my stomach hurts, and my whole body begins to ache, my head starts to pound and that's when i find comfort in the idea of ending it all - that there's a way out. thinking about it gives me comfort. writing letters to everyone gives me comfort. until it feels real and it all comes back and i miss people that i love. i miss the way things were and i miss when i didn't fuck everything up. i miss when i was loved unconditionally.
my friends having a good time is driving me to suicide
i know how stupid it sounds, but their lives are getting better and better and mine is slipping from my hands. i was feeling fine until a couple of days ago, then i saw them after a long time and they're just having fun, being social, meeting new people and being awesome all around. meanwhile i get panic attacks in public at the thought of having to speak to someone.  after seeing them socialize i just lost all hope, all my efforts don't matter if i'm too awkward to do anything with the results,the thought of having to see functional people like them again is making me crave death more and more .  and nobody is gonna read this cause it's a a wall of text from a socially inept wreck, if you're on this subreddit i suppose it's cause you're going trough something aswell, i hope everything gets better for you
my sister told me to kill myself (part 2)
part 1 (read first): [https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/cd8n23/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/cd8n23/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself/)edit- part 3: [https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/cjl0ro/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself\_part\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/cjl0ro/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself_part_3/)my sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. her apology wasn't even sincere. she was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.my mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. my sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.so i asked my sister, why are you mad at me?of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. i asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.the next day, i told my therapist that i tried to kill myself and she told me that i had to tell my mom. i told her, and she burst into tears. i also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.mom: why didn't you tell me any of this?me: i thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. and for the first time, he cried. i've never seen him cry before. and it broke my heart to see my parents like this.my mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. but i'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. but my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.i was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.edit: thanks for the silver!
i just want to sleep and never wake up again, anyone else feel the same?
i'm  24 years old. on the outside i lead a perfectly normal life. i have a  decent salary, friends i speak to regularly, i get along with everybody  at work. i do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.if  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that i've been  diagnosed as clinically depressed. i've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if i didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame i would not be here. i've been with  psychiatric teams, and a few therapists. it's all a temporary measure in  the end.i am a 'high performer' in my  workplace, and i have many who rely on me for support. i always smile,  and i try my best to make others happy whenever i can. but at the end of  every day, i feel empty. most times i have suicidal thoughts. there are  people i am able to speak to and 'open up' about how i feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.in more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. i have a  strong feeling i may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  i've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however i believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.there is a  brief moment of what i can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. i  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely i may soon lose.i  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say depression does not discriminate. you do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. we are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. best wishes to you all.
i hate this. one moment i want to die, the next i feel good and enjoy my life. i wish my fucking brain would make up it's mind.

“have you made any plans to kill yourself?”
difficult question to answer doc.i’ve planned how i’d do it in detail thousand of times, but have i planned it in the sense of how i’d plan to go to the mall and buy a new coat on tuesday evening? no.no timeframe, just a very detailed get-out clause for if i stop being able to handle this bullshit life any more. so i don’t know if that counts as making plans or not.
this is not living man. just pretending to be happy and watchi g the years go by only to end up dead anyway. mother fuckkkkkkkkkerrrrrrr ahhhhhhhh

anyone else waiting on parents to die so they can finally kill themselves?
i don’t want my parents to die obviously but eventually it will happen. and once that happens , i have no other reason to live. i will also be guilt free about killing myself and will probably just shoot myself in the head or something. does anyone else feel this way?
i want to commit suicide on xmas eve just like my sibling
my brother killed himself on xmas eve  when i was extremely young. i still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. no one talks about it or mentions him. they have practically erased him from our family's history. maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. maybe both.either way, i want to join him.. now that i've grown up, i understand why he did what he did. i understand that he wasn't wrong, and i don't feel like i'd be in the wrong for doing the same... i'd be doing the world a favor.i feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since i was a child. it's been nothing but chaos. i was preconditioned not to ever trust. i was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. my mother stayed with a known pedophile while i was relegated to foster care and group homes. i feel like i wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. yet, i went on to get married once a upon a time. i had two kids. i got a divorce. i started a business. i got my bachelor's degree. i bought a house. ...and then i became addicted to alcohol. i made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, i now have nothing. my children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. and the courts were correct. i'm a fuck up. there's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. i've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. i thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. i destroyed my last relationship. i hurt my partner in countless ways. after we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and i swore i'd do better or try to be better. i tried as hard as i could.. but i've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who i am. i can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. i broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when i tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. i turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...i can't get the job i want. all of my stuff is in storage and i can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. their ultrasounds. their footprints from their first day alive... my car is gone now, too.. i can't drive to get to work. i can't drive to an interview. i can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. i live in the middle of nowhere, and i have no resources. i can't take on new clients and make money. i've fallen as far down the hole as i can, and there's no way back up.i've had my friends tell me that i should be proud.. that i should just stick things out, because things will get better. but things will never improve, and i haven't felt like i could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. there is literally no way to return to the life that i worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. i don't have the money, i don't have the resources, and i am too afraid to ask my friends or family for help. i feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if i just didn't exist. i feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. i feel like all of the work i put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. i feel like i am a waste of oxygen and space. i feel like all i do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. i have no one. my mother and i are estranged. my remaining siblings and i hardly ever talk. i'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. i'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.i have nothing left, and i have no more motivation to continue on.i just want to disappear. i want it to appear that i just left without saying a word. no one would notice, because i have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. i am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and i don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. i don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. i'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. people keep trying to tell me that i have so much to live for - that i have so much talent and potential. people keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. they don't have to live with me, i do. i hate who i am and who i've become. i know that i'm sorry. i cannot even begin to describe the remorse that i feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. i wish i had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...i'm everything that i never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. i have no personality. i have nothing positive to add to the world. i've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do i (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? i'm sorry if this seemed rambley. i had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but i figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. i don't want my kids to know i killed myself... so i'm going to disappear to a place where i will never be found. i don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. i'm afraid they'll think i'm just begging for attention. or maybe they will think i don't mean what i say... but i really do want to die.thanks, reddit.
funny when they say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem
when all your existing is the problem in the first place when  life is just one big pain in the assto me personally i feel like everything is just a big waste of time ...this life is just not good enough not fullfilling enoughits so cold and boring and so so tiringit's really dreadful some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can heal magically))and like depression too...(some people tried everthing to overcome depression but they failed)so please stop saying that really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their livesit will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do(no hate in the comments thats only my opinion) edit : holy shit omg thanks for all of you commenting on this post...it got attention really fast lol i gusse im not the only one feeling this way huh...
born to die?
has anyone else had the thought if suicide for as long as they can remember? like it comes and goes, but ya get the feeling that it is your destiny kind of?as if it's inevitable at some point that it's gonna happen regardless of what you do or dont do?or is it just me?
finally stopped— pet cat was the solution
i got a cat. i’m focusing on my company now and stopped trying to trade. the cat brings me so much peace of mind i’m so in love with it. however my dad hates pets and he’s trying to make me get rid of him. i’m so sad i can’t imagine losing him he sleeps on my lap while i work or lays on my desk. i love it so much
it's my 26th birthday today. i have severe bpd, i am alone, and my mom used my birthday card as a way to argue how bpd isn't caused by abuse and that she is a perfect angel who has never done anything wrong.
i got in a car crash a few weeks ago, i live in a small town, so i lost both my job's, and i am unable to work now. every day i take less and less care of myself, no one really calls me, or even cares, and i don't blame them i am pretty fucked up because of the borderline personality disorder. i hate how alone i am all the time, i hate how little support i have. my life for being a american has been pretty fucking shitty. 26 years of some pretty sever social isolation has taken its toll on me, i have been in and out of hospitals the past year. what is the point of life when you have no love, or support? i can't can't change my circumstances, but i'm just done. i don't see a point to even trying anymore. i have just been laying in bed the past week binge watching porn since i cant afford anything to get high off of. social media makes things worse, it's all just a bunch of assholes flaunting how they have friends and get to do shit. i even had a severely developmentally disabled girl tell me how she is going to get a date tonight, i know that sounds shitty, i don't hold anything against her that's actually awesome that she can do that. i'm looking at things from my shitty perspective, and i honestly don't want to be alive. people just tell me things will get better, blah blah blah. i am on the verge of being homeless, and i have to live everyday knowing that because both my parents are pos's that my life is fucked, my mental state is fucked, and i am going to suffer till the fay i die. i wish i didn't live in a small hell hole, full of ignored conservatives. seriously the ignorance in my town is astonishing.
even though i felt like killing myself i went to this art therapy class and made something today

is anyone else happy in their dreams?
so often in my dreams i'm carefree and active. even having fun. then i wake up, and come brutally crashing down into the bleak, unending hell that is real life. it's cruel.
my 15 year old brother hung himself and all i want to do is die too...
i just feel so hopeless. so fucking hopeless. everyday i wake up and think about him and how the possibility of me moving out at 18 caused him to despise me and hate me. i had become increasingly distant weeks before he passed because i was so busy with work, getting a new apartment, etc..and i hate being so mad at myself for not being able to be there. i wish i would have been the one to die instead. i am a bitter and angry person all the time and no matter what i do i just can’t seem to get rid of all this anger and aggression i feel. my boyfriend doesn’t help. just gets mad at me for being mad. i just want to give up. i haven’t cut for over a year but lately it’s been the only thing to help anything. i just want my brother back. i’ve never thought suicide was so selfish until i lost my best friend and all i want is to see him again. it hurts, a piece of my heart is gone. i just wish i could have been the one to die instead.  i just wish i would have died instead.
i'm killing myself tomorrow
i have everything already planned out and i'm 100% sure that i'm hanging myself tomorrow. don't bother messaging me as as i've already decided that i'm doing this. sorry that this is so short, i kind of just felt like i wanted to say this so someone, anyone who would listen. i'm logging off of all social media after i post this. so if you're reading this, these are probably gonna be my last words on the internet. goodbye.
the foo fighters saved my life
this sunday night, i was about to end my life. i took a few painkillers, sleeping pills and drank some beers. i was just about to slit my wrist, when the radio played my absolute favorite song, my hero. this song finally gave ma a little bit of a good feeling, a big improvement after days of pure numbness, just enough to get me to call an ambulance.i’m now in a hospital and the suicide thoughts are finally slowly fading away. i hope, it stays this way. thank you so much for reading this and please stay strong!
i want to die but don't want to kill myself
therapist says i'm being too extreme but honestly, i'm just too average at everything to be happy with myself. i'm too dumb to get any of the jobs i want to actually have and i'm too smart to be able to settle for something menial and be fufilled. i'm not depressed enough to need serious intervention but i'm not stable enough to be truly without it. i'm average at everything or worse. i can never achieve what i want to because i am simply not intelligent enough. i don't even have the will power to end everything. i'm just pathetic and weak.
i would rather kill myself than grow as a person
i'm fucking done with life man. life fucking sucks in every which way. i do not want to be honest about who i am. i do not want yo grow. i do not want to accept anything. i do not want responsible. i don't want to work hard or be a part of anyone's life. i don't want to make a difference or contribute to society. having a career of any kind is too much fucking work. the truth is i'm perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out. the. i'll logically be on the streets and at that point i will kill myself. but why let it go that far? why shouldn't i buy a gun asap and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me, when i want nothing to do with that? i'm a loser and i'm okay with that. not being a loser is seriously too much work. giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work. i just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that i don't give a shit about my life or other people and i'm not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word.
ever feel like you want to just go to sleep and never wake up instead of actually dying?

this world is messed up.
i love this subreddit but it’s really concerning to see so much pain and hurt in one place. to know how many people are suffering quietly without others knowing sucks, especially on just one part of the internet. to all the guys and girls out there i hope you find happiness.
the reasons to live askreddif thread only made me feel worse
there are people out there who can be content with the smell of freshly fallen rain and warm garlic bread meanwhile i could have everything and still be miserable.that entire thread was just a reminder that i'm too broken to relate to other people and i'll never be happy.
i’m so tired of not having a social life, i’m tired of being mentally ill, i just want to die

does anyone here talk to literally no one. like no friends. i’m rotting
anyone else rotting away and dying in this shithole prison cell known as life. i’m not exaggerating either when i say i talk to no one.  i can’t think, i can’t talk i’m a degenerate peace  of shit.
i told my mom i'm suicidal, she forgot.
a few weeks ago i was doing a few chores with her when i broke down and told her that i hated life and that all i ever did when i woke is wishing something would kill that day because i'm not brave enough to do it myself, she called me ungrateful and i snapped and slapped her (it was wrong and i did apologize after it) she cried and that's where it ended. today i broke down again and told her i needed help, she told me that i can talk to her whenever i want to wich i answered don't you remember what happened the last time we talked? she said that she did remember, that she remember how i slapped her, when i asked her if she remembers why i did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked what were we talking abouti'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does? i'm just a waste anyways.
i always wonder how it feels to live a happy life
i’ve been depressed for so long i can’t even remember how it feels to be consistently happy and okay with life. i want to know the feeling of enjoying my life and it’s crazy to think that most people around me have a mostly happy life and here i am thinking about suicide every few hours of the day. it’s also crazy how you don’t even know if someone might be feeling the same as you. i hope everyone reading this has a great dayedit: i didn’t really think this many people would see this and comment, but it’s nice to know i’m not alone. i hope everyone finds what they are looking for and gets through the struggles in your lives.
the worst feeling in the world is knowing how little you matter
i think about this often. i’m actually a pretty social person who could talk to anyone, yet something about me just repels people. i don’t really try to make friends anymore because i know they’ll just leave anyway. i get that life happens but people don’t care like they say they do. i know for a fact if i weren’t here anymore, people would be “heartbroken” and “shocked”, yet where are they? if they knew me, they’d see how bad i hurt. why was i always the one to check in? to offer help?
i have no friends. nobody ever contacts me first
and i'm okay with it. i'm a failed professional who is miles behind academically and professionally my friends. so i don't care about seeing them. they never contact me first and i haven't bothered my ass to contact them in months. i'm at a point now where i say fuck it do i live a life without friends or just end it all now and find peaceforgot to mention i have zero self esteem
does anyone else feel like they don't want to kill themselves but they wish to die everyday?
it's hard to kill yourself here, and the person i trusted the most to talk to betrayed me. i just wish everyday maybe a car will hit me, or some mugger will shoot me in the head. 
okay so, i'm 21. i have type 1 diabetes, cervical cancer, and a brain tumor. i'm putting serious financial strain on my family with all these medical bills. i just don't see the point in putting them through this, and myself through all the awful treatment, just to like.... die anyway?
it's hard to stay positive and find the will to live. any advice?
never gonna live to be a teenager
it's fifty past midnight where i am, and i plan on leaving in ten minutes or so.made a throwaway account so the people who know me on other subreddits don't see this on my account. i don't want to upset anybody. i know there are probably people preparing to comment why do you have reddit, you are baby, this is why you are big sad toxic community is poisoning our children omg big pharma but please, dear strangers, do not worry. i won't be going against reddit's terms of service for long, now. :')i know this post is probably gonna be forgotten in about an hour or so, but i want to make record of something while i have time, even if nobody reads it:my name is hannah, i'm twelve years oldi love music and painting things and i was here once, too.things with my family are messy. they want to love me, i think, but things can get in the way. i wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. i know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and i hope the best for them. i hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.you are all worthy of happiness. i'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated. try to look for the good while you can still see. i love you, hope i don't see you too soon.
can someone just hug me while i cry?
it's all too much, i lost all my motivation.
suicide is on my mind 24/7 but i know all that i really want is to feel like i’m loved.
hi everyone, my name is everett. i’m turning 15 soon and i’ve grown up in an abusive religious family. i switched schools last year because i had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. my last school i got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when i talked. i don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. people started making rumors of me at my new school that i was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when i shoot up the school” because i have asperger syndrome. i’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where i have no self confidence. my longest relationship ever was 1 month. i want something that’s longer but i feel like no one trusts me. my mother hates me because i constantly fuck up, and i turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. she wanted a girl. my real dad is a drunk bastard and i disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. my step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks i have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. he constantly emotionally abuses me when i do things “not holy”. i’ve wanted to run away since i can remember up till about 6th grade when i realized with my state’s laws that i can’t and it would be easier to end myself. so i’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and i’m such a failure i can’t even kill myself properly. again, you might say that “i don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing i want anymore. i recently got a job and i bought a few things that i thought might help but of course it didn’t. i just want to feel as if i’m loved and i want to turn my sadness into love for them. but of course i can’t have it. i’m doubting what i believe in right now. the only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. i also think i’m a psychopath. ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything i should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. but of course, i’m such a fucking pussy i couldnt even do that properly . people keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. i constantly build everything up because i don’t want to hurt anyone and i don’t know when it’ll come out. everyone that i think i might have a chance with pushes me away after i express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point i can remember the last time i’ve smiled. i have to wear a mask in front of my parents (emotional mask) because if they found out i wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems. i have to wear a mask everywhere i go because someone could report it and my parents would find out. it doesn’t help either that every adult i know doesn’t take me seriously because i’m not an adult. anyways if you’ve read up to this point, thank you. (no formatting because i’m on my phone rn)
today is my birthday...
i turned 20 today. it's significant because i never thought i'd make 20. the last few years have been really rough and i can't count how many nights i thought about taking my own life. yet here i am. i broke down in the shower just thinking about how close i was to not being here. &#x200b;i start counselling soon and i'm going to make a big effort to try and turn my life around. i've spent long enough being miserable and i deserve to be happy. i hope on my next birthday i look back on this day proud of how far i've come. i hope that this is the last birthday where i feel sad.
you ever wish someone would kill you so you wouldn’t have to do it?

survivors of suicide are glad they are alive bullshit
i've had at least 6 attempts in the last 12 months. all but the last one i realized i was too stupid/drunk/depressed to make a serious attempt. the latest one i hanged myself, and the fucking cord broke. i woke up pissed that the piece of shit cord couldn't hold my weight.&#x200b;i just read something this morning 70% of those who attempt suicide never do so again. bull shit. your statistics are based on people who answer your survey. i have never been surveyed for my depression, abuse by parent, or suicide attempts because i have never reported it. so fuck your statistics.
i wish i could give my life to someone who wants to live
sometimes, i wish i could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. i do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. i feel like i am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. i have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. i wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.see, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. i do not have any hobbies, and i do not have a job. i am going to be evicted if i do not find something before may, and while i have been applying, i also don't see the point. i have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until i am older enough to retire. i think i would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. there mornings where i wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. that's really what i am doing... i am waiting to die.it kind of feels good to type this out. i have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. it's almost like i've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. my boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. my therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so i am without support (or structure). i do not have any friends. my family thinks i am being a drama queen and won't play this game with me anymore. if i were to kill myself tonight, i wonder how long it would take the world to notice. i imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.i have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but i am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. i'm 80% sure since i have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- i don't drink, so i image i don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like i can pull it off. my biggest fear is failing. i am afraid i will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. god, i don't want to spend more time in a psych ward. 
it’s 4am. i have my first class of the semester in 5 hours and i can’t sleep
i wasted my whole fucking summer looking for jobs and getting nothing. i can’t do internships because my grades suck. my whole family thinks i’m a lazy sack of shit for “not doing anything” and instead of relaxing for two months i was just stressing to make sure i could make $100 a monthi’m stressed because literally nobody around me fucking needs me.
i wish boys were allowed to be feminine without being judged.
i’m a feminine guy and i just want to express it when i’m at school. the judgement that i get is too much to bear and the only thing that i can get away with is a flower in my hair, and even then i get a few insults hurled at me. i would do much more if i wasn’t judged. i can’t express who i am to the world and have to bottle it up.i fucking hate this. this is just a minor point in the many reasons i just want to kill myself.
i'd kill myself today if it wasn't for my family. i'd ruin their lives
i hate myself but i know if i commit suicide, i'll destroy my family, i'll ruin their lives and they'll be so sad :(
is there really a good reason to be alive?
seriously, all i see on here is people saying the same things,” it will get better.”,” what about your family or friends?”,” suicide is a permanent solution is a temporary problem.” saying the same things over and over again that don’t mean anything. is there a reason suicidal people should stay alive besides living for other people, so other people won’t feel bad about it? all i keep seeing are these the same cringy quotes and it’s just making me even more suicidal. i swear if i hear more of that dumb shit i’m going to just end it already.
who else is waiting until they feel they're allowed to kill themselves?
personally my mom couldn't bear with it so i'm waiting until she passes away. once this happens i can finally end this misery.
hi i went from 100% certain i want to kill myself to not knowing what to do... i guess its an improvement? thanks ya all that helped i would be dead by now if it wasn't for you all... im looking forward to seeing what the future will bring... cheers on ya all!!

this will get lost in a sea of suicide notes
i’m using this to say exactly how i feel cause i know no one will see this. the last time i was genuinely happy was when i was 5.. then my grandfather died. i was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom i was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and i alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause i never feel good enough and i can never fully trust them. anyways i was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but i have 3 childhood best friends i can at least say i have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives i feel stuck. my life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when i began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition i have that i didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said i shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye i had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. i took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in february of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. i had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..i eventually got a job ( which i hate with a passion) and became stuck... then i got into a car accident and totaled my car so now i’m carless. i want to go back to school and get a new car but i feel like what’s the point if i won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when i wake up before i open my eyes i think “ am i going to be able to even see”. it sucks because surgery won’t work, i’ve tried the holistic approach too and i’m still just slowly losing my sight. i really took things like that for granted.  my parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture i’m like what’s really the point? i’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping i’ll die. i told my mother i want to kill myself before i go completely blind because i couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so i said i’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause i’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when i try to get my shit together nothing goes right, i had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( i was supposed to get one yesterday if i got the job) that was my breaking point. that job really was a push for me to keep going but now that i didn’t get it i feel stuck again, i feel like i sound stupid and dramatic and i know this is worded horribly but i guess i’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. i’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but i’ve seen that there are none... if i had a gun i’d just shoot myself, i looked up oding on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, i thought about hanging myself but i’m black and i’d feel weird idk lol, i think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping i’ll die but i don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, i thought about cutting myself but i’ve read that that’s a slow death. it’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. i guess i sound like a bitch cause i want to die but i don’t want to feel any pain but i guess i’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. there’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though i already said a lot, all in all i’m just so tired. tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. i’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like i still crave human interaction that’s why i feel like a fraud cause i want to be alone but i don’t to feel alone. this whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but i’m just writing out my thoughts. no one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. at first i was giving myself till the end of the year but now i’m just trying to find the best method to end it.
i want to kill myself. and people know. but they don’t care. i hate myself so much. i just don’t want to live anymore.

y'all ever just lay down in bed in the fetal position and cry and just try to will yourself out of existence for a couple hours?
anyone else do this?
i just told my parents im suicidal
now i'm going to get some professional help. wish me luck please
humanity is the worst race to be a part of
we are like enslaved cows, we are born forced to go to school to get education so that we can be successful, then we must word 9 hours a day to be able to live peacefully and those who are out of that format are either lucky or homeless. i am too a part of that format. recently found someone that cares about me(a girlfriend) but i just can find the place in my heart to like her. she is amazing and beutiful yet i cant stop looking at other girls and wishing they were intrested in me. im stressed as fuck from school and it all doesnt seem worth. adult life does not look good. at all.i dont have the guts to do it to my family thought. i just wish the world would end
college is stupid and it makes me want to die even more
i don’t know what the fuck is wrong with my school in particular. they never even showed me how to schedule an advisor meeting. i started out with 4 classes and had to drop two of them because i was failing (both grades below 50%) and these profs couldn’t teach if you put a gun to their heads. now i have this whole english research paper to write on some bullshit topic i chose and we have to “collaborate” and “brainstorm” in class with people who are writing completely different papers. it’s fucking stupid. they’re not sharing my grade why should i have to ask for their help?? i keep skipping class cause i don’t want to go through that bullshit even if my grade suffers.i think i’d be happier dropping out, living with my parents, and just working two jobs so i can focus on my side hustle. it’s just hard when my parents are immigrants and they keep telling me i’m wasting the opportunity they gave me. i don’t know. i just know i can’t take this shit anymore.
humans :)
humans are funny creatures. when you tell them i am happy, i am good at this they make fun of you and say you're a loser you should go kill yourself.when you tell them i'm a loser. i'm gonna kill myself, they go ahead and tell you noooo please don't, you deserve life and happiness like everyone.&#x200b;fuck you humanity. fuuuuuck, you.&#x200b;edit: ok my intention wasnt not spreading hate. i'm pointing out the irony of our nature as human beings. when i say humans i'm talking about people who live in modern society, and i'm included in that bunch.
does anyone else feel like they have to commit suicide to get revenge on the people that hurt me, to tell the world i am not gonna put up with its crap, and to that i have to do it to ask the world to solve the problems i am facing for others?
i have been suicidal ever since my grandparents passed away several years ago. i don't have much family, i feel like i need to kill myself to escape that pain because it can't be solved because you can't bring dead people back from the dead, and i feel like if i kill myself i can leave a note to tell the world to solve this problem for others. i am estranged from the family i do have and i feel like i need to kill myself to let them know they have hurt me. i hate how i don't have a big family, lots of friends, don't have a good job or are rich, and don't get to go on vacations. people disrespect me. i feel like if i kill myself i can tell the world that i am not gonna put up with its unfairness. would me commuting suicide and writing a detailed note change the world? i hate how people think of mental health issues when they think of suicide when they don't think of lonliness or lack of family casting it. i know some peopme say that family doesn't have to be blood but someone will always tell me when i say that blood is thicker than water. maybe this will tell the people that say that i won't put up with that bullcrap.
hey santa, all i want for christmas is to fall asleep and never wake up.

i wish i could die without upsetting my family

not even really depressed - simply realized that the way reality is constructed just doesn’t suit me
i would probably kill myself if it wasn’t unfair to the people that love me. i don’t have any specific problems, successful with all the things that i do but i just don’t like doing all the things you have to do to live. i don’t like living and it’s pointless. one the one hand i cannot destroy the lives of my parents and affect my friends in such a tragic way on the other hand i hate existing, what should i do?
no one will ever love me
no friends, no girlfriend and i doubt i'll get any. i get so little attention in my life that i seek some orange arrows and empty comments from strangers on the internet. i have nothing to live for. i just waste my life more and more everyday. i will never achieve anything, no one will miss me and i have no one to miss. i don't even like my family. my savings is my timer. i have been jobless for 6 months now, and once my savings are dried up i'm  going to kill myself. i've already tried killing myself before, but i will make sure to finish the job next time. i would rather be dead and continue living in this worthless life. i look forward to using the rest of my money, i find peace knowing i won't he here for much longer. i'm too tired to continue trying. so to the few of you that actually read this, good luck. you'll need it in this fucked up world. i hope you find a reason to live.
16m can i tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts without him telling my parents?
i don’t want to go to a mental hospitaledit: i talked to my therapist and he told me he is going to tell my parents. i appreciate everyone trying to help me, but i just don’t see things getting better.
it will get better being the biggest lie ive been told. i desire suicide.
i currently suffer from borderline personality disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which i believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. i'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long i've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. i lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until i feel sick, staring blankly at my tv which is almost never turned off. i never leave my room. i store bottles of water and food by my bed so i can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.i hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service i use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before i would be able to push them away with made up situations i create with them in fear of abandonment. i fear rejection. i push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so i can say i wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones i love out for no proper reason is the very definition of fucked up.what surprises people the most is the fact that i am well aware that i have friends.i am well aware that i have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.i am well aware that i need help. i am not in denial. but i'm made to believe i'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.i'm made to believe i'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so i look fucking stupid despite telling people i just..can't. i don't have the energy anymore. like, i just can't.i had goals in life. i dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because i'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. just being happy.unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.i couldn't tell you what's worse.so far, i found someone i wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and bpd making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. he faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. we had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again i destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations i made up in my head. i'm deeply in love with this person and i struggle to see it work out anymore unless i fix myself but i'm beyond help and don't know how i would even fix myself at this point. i have given up. i am tired. i wanted to fix myself to prove to him that i could be the best person i could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry i am for the drama and hurt i caused him. the verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. i look back at the things i did and i just struggle to live a day to day life knowing i caused so much hurt to the person i've loved so deeply since i met him. the person i would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. all i think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that i'll probably never experience these things with him again because i'm so broken. friendship with this person is hard, and i'm deeply saddened that i can't tell him just how i feel. it has driven me to believing i'd be better off dead so i can't hurt him anymore.i also wanted to fix myself for my family. my friends. for myself. things could be so good right now if i wasn't such a horrible person, so far all i've ever done is created problems for everyone that i've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and i can't stand this life anymore. i'm so fucking sad and i'm sick of hurting everyone i love. i am unlovable and don't deserve friends. this may be it for me, reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. i have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. i don't think anything could save me now. mum would be devastated, and who knows if anyone in my circle of friends would care, and i love my mother but i am in pain.
anyone else ever feel like suicide gives them hope?
i feel like it's the only way i'll ever be able to escape the hell im slowly creating for myself.
my worst fear has come true and i have already decided that i am going to take my own life
i am a 31 yo gay male who was severely bullied throughout my childhood whilst having to come to terms with my sexuality. nowadays it’s ok to be gay but when i was growing up it was not. i was surrounded by people both in and out of school that would either physically and mentally torment me and others that would just watch it happen and do nothing to help as if i deserved it. i was very confused and vulnerable at the time so i felt powerless to stop it and just let it happen.as a result, i developed ocd and body dysmorphia. from that point on i thought the only way people would ever accept me or want to be around me is if i was perfect. i strived for perfection; i was a straight a student, i ate really healthy, i was physically active and i valued my appearance above all else. i could confidently say that i was an attractive guy and i know now i had a lot going for me. regardless of how hard i tried to be perfect over the years i developed social anxiety and although i had some really good memories, the anxiety plagued most of my young adult life and i missed out on so many good opportunities because of it. slowly but surely i was able to move past my mental issues and live a somewhat normal life. i had a good job, decent friends and a loving family. when i turned 29 i fell in love with this guy who looked like an angel and we were both madly in love. i thought i could finally be happy unconditionally and it would have all been worth it. it wasn’t until we moved in together that i realised he was anything but angelic and that’s when the physical and mental abuse started all over again - like i was back in high school. he was a sociopath but i didn’t realise until it was too late. he abused me throughout our relationship and slowly tore me down til i was nothing. after 2 years of torment i finally got out of the abusive relationship and got a place on my own but that’s when all my unresolved childhood demons came to surface. my body dysmorphia and ocd came back but with extreme vengeance. i dissected everything about my appearance; my hair, my body my skin etc. my hair wasn’t as thick as it was in my early 20s so i went to turkey and got a transplant, whilst i was there i also got lipo on my stomach even though i know now i didn’t even need it. i came back from turkey and worked out every day for 12 months until my body was perfect. i was once more trying to become the ultimate version of myself even though there was nothing wrong with me to begin with.it all took a turn for the worst when i started focusing on my skin. my skin wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t bad. i researched ways to improve it and found something called skin needling that most beauty clinics offered as a way to rejuvenate the skin. i bought a package of 5 sessions at my local clinic and did the full course of 5 spread out a month apart. after the first few sessions i noticed my skin was getting irritated, red and dry. i brought this up with the rep but she assured me this was normal and that it was because my skin was healing. cut to the last session i got a severe infection and severe inflammation which slowly resulted in my entire face becoming fibrotic and scarred. in the night time you can’t see too much but in the day if you look at my face i look deformed. my entire face has fibrotic scarring that resembles scratch marks as if an angry cat did a number on me. i have seen multiple dermatologists and they can’t help me. this disfigurement is permanent and i look like a monster. i have seen multiple psychologists and they are trying to help me try and come to terms with it but i just can’t. one told me that this is my worst fear come true since all the value i put on myself was in my appearance. every time i look at myself in the mirror i want to die. i feel like if i didn’t have body dysmorphia which is obviously making the situation so much worse i may have stood a chance. i have taken a month off work for the christmas period and have been staying at my parents because i’m too scared to be alone. for the past month  i have been drinking excessively every day, eating excessively and smoking excessively. every part of my being has given up on life and i havnt left my room. i have been researching ways to end my life and i feel like this is it for me; after all this struggle with my mental health this is how it’s going to end. my worst fears have come true.my parents and brother can see what has happened and they sympathise with me but they don’t realise the extent of how much this has really messed me up. i wake up every morning in disbelief this is happening to me. everyday for the past month i have wished to die and it’s only getting worse every day. my brother told me in confidence he went through his own struggle not too long ago and was planning to hang himself in our storeroom. he showed me the ropes and where he would have tied them. unbeknown to him this is how i plan to end it.  i don’t know if anyone will read this or can relate. i hope someone will.
being alive is fucking painful. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
post history for context
hanging myself tonight so i avoid my birthday and everything else

does anyone else feel like they are meant to kill themselves?
i have this weird feeling that i have to kill myself, as i was always going to kill myself. it feels sort of prophetic, like that's what this life had in store for me. i don't know it's strange, anyone else feel this way?
im surprised with how comfortable the thought of suicide has gotten with me and it scares me.
the thought of taking my own life has become surprisingly more comfortable/normal . it scares me. i have thought of it before but it was always  im never going to actually do that. but now its been cnsuming my thoughts more and more. i feel i have nothing , no one, no purpose. im useless, i have no where to turn. the silence is deafening and the thought of taking my life just creeps up more and more and it doesnt feel so crazy anymore. this is what scares ne to se ehow my thinking has changed and maybe in a month itll be the only thing i think of. it seems im going that directioni dont know what to really do. i tell nyself im being selfish and i have family that cares for me and theyll be sad but its not convincing me anymore.i just hate how lonely i feel.i look around and think what am i doing. im fooling myself. i try to be happy and joke around with others. tell myself its all in my head but i feel im losing control. im scared.edit- sorry lots of grammar and spelling errors. i'm on an old phone thats a little hard to fix
anyone ever notice this?
the people who will tell you how much they'd miss you if you killed yourself are the same people who are content to ignore you everyday you're alive.
my boyfriend comes from 3 generations of suicide. he took his life in november 2017. i am really fucking depressed. we have a 7 year old daughter. i feel ill every moment of every day.
he was my best friend. i have constant nightmares. we struggled so much after his death - i got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. i battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at christmas because she missed her daddy. that student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...she has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. the rumor went around that her dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. i worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best i could. i found every resource possible for her. but i didn’t take any time for myself i guess. my family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. my mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. she also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her dad’s side of her family. she got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. after her dad’s death, i brought my daughter to her dad’s family, across country. my mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. she can’t handle not having control over my daughter.so i’ve been battling with child protective. my mom filed for custody of my daughter. there have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on dhs and they aren’t fucking around with anything. so even though i’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - i’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. if you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.i’m done with it all. my daughter is now a stranger to me. it’s been 7 months without her and i really have no purpose in life anymore. i mean, i know my worth but being involved with the state and system rips your entire soul up. i have no fucking purpose to live. i understand why her dad left. i want to leave also. 
i don’t want to kill myself, but i still want to die.
i just give up. there’s no light at the end of the tunnel, it won’t get better, i can’t just get through this bit... that’s what people always say, they’ve been telling me things will get better for years. well they haven’t yet and they never will, because i don’t fucking try to improve my own life, because i don’t care, because i deserve to suffer.the voices came back strong. i’m starting to agree with them more and more. they’re right, he doesn’t care, no one does. there is no way to get better, no one wants to help, no one will. you can’t make it better, so why try. i’m not even good enough to kill myself, i can’t do anything, i just want it to take me. i give up on even trying. i’m just going to walk awayand let it take me.
have you ever gotten jealous over hearing about someone's suicide?
now i did not personally know this guy, i left my town's school in 6th grade, and he moved to my town about a year or two after so i never went to school with him but i knew of him cause he hung out with my friends from town. anyway, i am 24 now. a few days ago, i started seeing people posting rip statuses on social media, and posting tributes to him with pictures and what not. apparently, he was really depressed for awhile and finally decided he had had enough. at first i felt bad, and i still do. but then i started to feel really jealous, because since i was 12 i have been clinically depressed and have tried so, so many times in the past decade to kill myself, but it was never successful at it, and not a day has gone by that i haven't wanted to be dead. and apart of me is thinking it's not fair that he got to die and i'm still here. has anyone else ever felt like this?
it just costs too much to live
i can’t handle poverty any more. everything is too expensive. i’m afraid to use my heat this winter because the electric bill would be too much. i have a radiator and a pile of blankets, but if i don’t run the heat the pipes will freeze and i can’t pay to fix that if they burst. i don’t wanna live because all i do is pay bills. there’s no enjoyment in my life, just constant stress and worry and fear that i’ll end up homeless. everything is a struggle. i have to strategically be late on certain bills so the service doesn’t get shut off but i can pay one thing while i neglect another. interest on my loans and credit cards makes it so i don’t seem to make progress paying anything back. i just can’t take it anymore.

my last day.
today is my last day. i cant deal with my mental health any longer. its been 27 years of pure hell. i have only been fighting so others wouldnt be uncomfortable if i killed myself. i wont do it any more. i have great things going for me on the outside but inside me it is my own personal hell. i have done everything to try to overcome this and nothing works. for several reasons. i am terrified to die but it has to be better than the hell i live every second of my life.
fuck the future, friends getting houses, a living wage. i'm so tired of feeling hopeless
first off, fuck winter. i'm so tired of spending the entire winter wanting to end it. its ridiculous.with the general election coming up, it's just gonna fuck over the country even more and i'm already broke. like £2 in the bank broke until tomorrow night. and now friends are setting deposits on houses and settling into well paid jobs that are over 20k a year. its just a repeating cycle of hopelessness. theres literally no chance of not struggling for my entire life and i cant keep dealing with it. i'm so tired of being happy for a day then watching as everything just falls apart around me. i'm so fucking tired. i hate my job. i'm too depressed to write my cv since theres nothing positive to say, and i feel stupid for even thinking that. i'm just so done.
im extremely tired.
not even sure if i'll make it past today, im exhausted of living. im sorry.
i have never had affection in my life, respect or trust, and i was abused and gaslit by my whole family for over 20 years. suddenly, my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option?
some backstory is needed here.i'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people or a normal life. taken for granted and bullied in school.i was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.nearly killed by her and from the day i started noticing the gaslighting i also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them......telling me it was my fault and you are the one who drove her to kill you. you made her miserable.literally the only people i can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because i am 100% alone and because i can't even start talking. the only times i hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.my only way out is a job. my short term memory is mostly gone so i can't study (i tried, failed, had to leave uni) and i have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.so here i am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that i look forward to.in all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an objective solution, as the only one. i am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, i'm listening.thank you in advance.p.s. i see many of you contacted me privately, but that's a lot of you, so don't be upset if i can't answer: i appreciate.
attempted. got put on antidepressants. regret not using a more effective method
i hate that i fuckin survived
am i faking being depressed for attention?
i at this point have started to doubt if i'm just doing everything for attention. i do things like venting to close friends when i'm feeling way too deep down. i sometimes just want to see if they care because a lot of my thoughts surround the fact that nobody actually cares about me. that everybody hates me. sometimes i've gotten mad at people for acting like they don't care. because everyone says they care but never shows it. i get mad about the fact that they pretend they care cause if they don't, they should just tell me that. cause deep inside it's what i want. so i can prove to myself that i'm the failure i believe i am. so i can finally kill myself without the guilt. i'm very confused. am i faking it??
i can always just die after graduation
i don't think i want to continue living in this world after i graduate college. i still have over a year left, but i worry about my future every single day. i don't think i'm cut out to live in this highly competitive world. i struggle enough already as a student and have no passions or ideas about what i want to do. i want to exist, but not the way the majority of people in this society have to exist. so, my thoughts go to suicide quite a bit these days. i think to myself, i can always just die and then i won't have to deal with any of it anymore. i don't want to work my life away. i'd rather just be dead and move on to whatever comes next. i'm just so scared.
it feels weird when i remember that suicide is such a scary thing for most people to discuss. i keep forgetting that most people aren't suicidal, and that even the slightest mention of it can make them panic.
at this point i've been suicidal for so long that it's just part of my life. it feels like you have your job, your hobbies, etc, and your suicidal thoughts. apparently not for most people though.anytime anyone ever finds out that i'm suicidal, i'm actually pretty surprised by how much of a reaction it inspires in them.
why do so many people get to die by accident and for me to die i have to kill myself.
fuck
i crochet a blanket for my boyfriend to say goodbye
i have been planning my suicide for a while now and today is finally the day i will be happy. a couple of months ago i asked my boyfriend to choose a colour palette but i didn't tell him that it was for the colours of yarn i will use to make a blanket for him as a goodbye gift. i've been working really hard on this blanket and trying to make it perfect. before i wrap it i will spray it with my perfume that i always wear and tuck the bottle in the blanket so he can spray it on whenever it loses the smell. with it i will also write a letter to explain why i'm giving him this gift.
i don't understand the phrase suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem
is a permanent solution not what i want? i don't a temporary solution that will only work temporarily.
i am genuinely proud of this sub reddit
i honestly want to say something, i am happy that people are trying to help each other. online or offline, this is just the best thing.
does anyone else ever felt better after writing a suicide note/planning?
(copied and pasted from r/depression)i’ve had a long history of the crazies. i’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another. but the other night i spent hours researching suicide methods (i don’t have easy access to my gun anymore, which was my main plan last year, since i’m at college) and i wrote out a note and everything, then fell asleep. the next day was the best i’d felt in months honestly. it was weird. i’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal i’ve been since before i got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer...probably a bad idea but i don’t like being numb) and then the next day i was social, i talked to people, i felt actually okay. it was weird. i went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. i know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? like i don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because i mean i still want to kill myself, i’m not better. but i’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced the same sort of feeling. sorry if this is dumb. i’m tired.
(not suicide) just a thank you
hey guys of sw, just everyone out there. just thanks to all the repliers that help out all the people in need. this subreddits saves lives and as a replier myself, i know how many people that gets talked to and helped out... it's amazing, to have this out there you know. thanks for this subreddits
i just wanna go to sleep, never wake up, and forever live in my fantasy world

i drove to the gun store , parked , and drove back home
was having such a hard time with depression. i made the decision i was going to go to the gun store and kill myself the next day (last night). woke up , took a shower , got dressed and built up the courage to go... i got in the car and put the nearest gun shop in my gps. not playing any music whatsoever on my ride there, total silence for the 13 minute drive. mind racing 300mph. i parked next to the store and was trembling with fear , there it was the gun store. i tried to unlock my seatbelt and my hand was shaking. i was able to unlock my seatbelt , but that was it. i didn’t have the strength to get out the car and go inside. i ended up crying and calling my cousin asking if i could spend a few days at his house because i’m at a low point and i live all by myself. he said of course and so i turned the car back on drove back home packed a bag and headed to his house . i’m here at his house now and we just got dinner with his kids. i still feel like utter shit and want to die but something in me wouldn’t let me pull the trigger ( no pun intended). a small voice in my head is proud of me ..... but i’m still fighting this war of suicidal ideation and depression constantly and i feel like i’m losing . just had to share with someone.
i’m killing myself by the end of this week
i wanted to do it tonight but as i type this, i’m realizing again it’s my older brothers birthday. i don’t want his birthday to be a never ending memory of his 16 year old sister killing herself on the same day.i’m scared. i know that there’s never an easy way to kill yourself, not unless your assisted but even then it’s not easy especially when it’s illegal. i think i might overdose. i’m just scared of throwing up. maybe that makes me stupid, a coward and stupidly suicidal.i’m really done. i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit, i mean, i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years (and didn’t think much of it) until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was far from normal so i tried to get help. why wait 3 months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping, if i can just kill myself in those three months? there’s no point to anything anymore, i have no reason to live. besides, i’ve tried to kill myself twice already. (though, they obviously didn’t work.)third times a charm, right?edit: i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down. im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted, i’m tired of being abused, i’m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family. i don’t want pity, i really am just tired. i’m scared of myself and the future
all i think about is suicide and video games.
the title says it all. every relationship in my life is decaying because of it. i don't talk to people much anymore. i just want my video games. if i'm not absorbed in a video game, i'm thinking about dying. had a handful of close calls this year...
nobody will probably ever read this.
this post will likely be lost in the sea of thousands of posts on this sub, but i wanted to share the way i’m feeling. i just need to write this somewhere to get it out. i don’t want to be alive anymore. i’m at a point in my life where i’m not going anywhere, i just feel like i’m going in circles. i’m treading water, in my life, my relationships, everything, and everyone in my life is moving on without me. i don’t think anyone in my life really cares about me.  everyone in my life has either left completely or become completely distant, and i’ve never felt more alone. i have nobody. i meet new people, but they never stick around. is something wrong with me? i don’t know where my life is going, and i don’t want to go into it alone. i’m a nuisance to anyone i interact with, so i think i’ll always be this way. don’t get me wrong, i want to be better. i’ve tried to get better, but i’m just miserable and hopeless all the time. maybe that’s why people don’t stick around. maybe it was always me, and my sadness drove them away. i’m going to die a lonely death, and it’s my fault. i just wish i had someone in my life who i knew i could talk to, and be there for me. i don’t mean a therapist or a counselor or someone who’s obligated to listen to my depressing shit. i mean a real friend. i don’t want to die a painful death. i want it to be quick, painless, etc. but i don’t want my parents to find me. i want to just go missing and never be found. i just want to disappear, because i’m already practically invisible. someone please help me. i’m drowning.
anyone else wish they could hire a hit man for themselves?
throwaway account fyi.  but i don’t want to live anymore.  i’m 21m with an std that i haven’t gotten diagnosed cause i’m scared.  it sucks, i know i would never kill myself.  that would destroy my family.  but i wish i could pay a professional assassin to kill me within 6 months or something.i don’t want to see it coming, i just want to be shot in the back of the head without knowing it.  just poof, and be dead. fml
constantly flooded with memories and thoughts of every mistake in my life.
i just want to sleep but i can’t. every time i close my eyes it’s something shitty that’s happened to me or something shitty or stupid that i’ve done / said.so i sit awake and cry and panic and i can’t function.my mental health has always been a disaster but it really feels like non-stop deterioration at this point.i hate that i never have anything new to say. i can’t articulate anything so it’s just the same old “i don’t want to be here anymore why can’t i get the guts to end it already” over and over.i’m so miserable and so tired of being alone.i know that i have love and good in my heart to give to people but i’m so fucking stupid i just can’t talk to anyone.i know it’s never going to end until i do it. i know i will never meet someone who will stay. i know there’s no point. i just want to die.
do you ever wonder how other people aren’t suicidal?
i find it hard to believe that there are actually people out there who like themselves and enjoy life and don’t want to kill themselves. wow. 
we’re selfish for wanting to die, but other people aren’t selfish for wanting us to stay alive when we have no drive or real reason to fight the temptation.

i'm a pedophile and i deserve to die
i wanna die so much. i've never done anything to a kid and i never would but i hate myself so much for my desires. it's also fucking awful to know that i'll never be able to be sexually or romantically satisfied. i feel like i'll never be happy. i'm so scared i'm gonna hurt a kid and i actively avoid them. i don't know what to do anymore. i feel like tonight is a good night. it's sunday and i'm alone. i'm eating my favorite dinner. 
the first day after is really weird [tw: suicide attempt]
so last night i tried to kill myself. i had every intention on doing so. i was sitting in my car with my gun to my chin and i pulled the trigger but nothing happened. i usually keep a round in the chamber when i carry, so didn't think to rack the slide, instead i just cocked the hammer back. for whatever reason, maybe it was because i wasn't thinking straight, i never racked it after loading the magazine. so when i pulled the trigger, no bullet came out, and it was the loudest click i have ever heard in my life. o drove home and gave my roommate (who is also my best friend) my gun and i told him what happened. i cried, he cried, and he asked me to sleep in his bed with him so he would know i was there. i don't know how but i managed to sleep. but now, everything just feels off. i can't look people in the face, it's hard to concentrate at work, i don't know what to say to anyone. i wasn't supposed to be here today. people are telling me go to a doctor, but i don't want to, i've been through that before and it doesn't help. if you're reading this, thank you. i just needed a place where i could say what happened and not be judged or baker-acted or something.
my father took his own life 2 days ago.
i cannot believe he did this. i loved him so much and now he's gone forever. i have my brother and my mother but still i'll be lost and alone forever. i am so sad that i will never laugh with him again or see him. i fucking hate it. it was so unexpected. i wanted him to get old and see my kids. there's no one i can talk to like him. :(
a thing about me. please, if you have the time, please read it. i just want to let things out.
i'm posting this here because i just need a place to scream. sometimes, i wonder if i'm just not built for this world. if maybe i'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe i should just take my life because i feel like i cant accomplish anything.anyways, hi, my name is autumn, i'm 19 y/o transgirl and i graduated high school last year. as far as i'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct i have borderline personality disorder, asperger's syndrome, generalized anxiety disorder, and adhd. i've always had a hard time growing up. i was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when i was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. a part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because i feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. they just decided to go the old school route of hitting me until i got better grades. anyways, i hate my father. he's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and i wish he would just disappear. anyways, onto my personal life with friends. i am severely emotionally unstable, i experience things in extremes and i always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. i constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, i selfharm, i spend so much money. haha, i had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but i'd spend all of it on everything. i cant control it. i always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, i didn't mean to, i dont want to. but i cant control my behaviors and i hate it. i'm trying real hard to go to therapy, i'm hoping i can start dbt to help me with my bpd (borderline personality disorder).i just want to have friends i interact with on a regular basis and play games with. i try my best to reach out but i guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. which can really hurt i guess. one recent thing i've really gotten into is ffxiv. i try to ask other friends to play but, i just get ignored and such. it hurts a lot. i dont hate them i think, i dont. i just, i wish i had friends they have and play with. it gets really boring and lonely. aside from those things, sometimes, i wonder if everything would be better if i was dead. you see, i never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when i realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world i've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it i dont see any reason in going on, i think what's stopping me now is how ill informed i am with taking my own life and how afraid i am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. aside from that, there are 2 other people whom i love very much and cant bear to leave alone. my dream job is to edit videos for a youtube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. i'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of youtube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. sometimes i just wish i could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.anyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. i'm not happy. i'm not okay. i dont want to be alive. but maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others i see, but i'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard. i think i'm going to go cry some more now, i'll see you all some other time. if you took the time to read through all this, thank you... from the bottom of my heart.
life is shit and we all know it, i wish i could stop existing
life is a meaningless piece of shit. i hate everyone and everything. life is so fucked and unfair, and yes people say but you are not doing this, you're not doing that, you feel like shit, because of yourself and all that crap., but let me tell you something: i've been doing everything that people have been telling me such as consistently working out, running, creating a schedule, affirmations, self-help books which are worthless and doesn't help, take a walk, listen to podcasts, doing nofap, etc.nothing is helping and i don't want to live. the only reason i'm still alive is my new friends, they're my only inspiration, besides i don't give a shit, this world is full of crap. i'm tired of existing, it's so painful and meaningless, and maybe i'm lashing out right now and start to cry, but it feels good. sorry all you people who've read it.
i despise when mentally healthy people say go see a therapist
tehehe omg why didn't i think of that sooner. i'll just go see a therapist and they'll give me the magic antidote to my perpetual cravings for death that have persisted for years. thanks mentally healthy individual.
i want out of the rat race
haven’t even started and i don’t want to.  i don’t care about my “potential”.  i’d rather just not exist.
the annoying lexicon of suicide dissuasion
if anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it, i'd strongly urge them to not read any further because i would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone. i'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that i can poke holes of rationality in.i fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. the hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. in a strange way i think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like you're not the only one going through this or you have so much to live for or things will get better, i imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. for gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like i'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?if you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. we're all fully realized, functioning adults here. we don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. we don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us your'e not alone, we understand, before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. what is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? the reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in our own lives, tragedies in our own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. i wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. it is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. i wish people would just say you know what, i hear you. i get it. you do what you need to. because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you bullshit approach.that's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. i'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, i physically cannot even cry any more because i'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason i get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. and a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? it's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. it's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. there's nobody. it's all you. you alone are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. let me give you a hypothetical. let's say that the very problem that i have is that i have nobody in my life who would want to talk to me of their own accord. that's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. then how is the solution to that problem to pay somebody to talk to me? that simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. that even a designated helper will only talk to me if i incentivize them with money. and so the problem persists. i don't want a shrink. i don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. i just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say damn dude. shit sounds rough. i honestly don't know what i'd do if i were in your position. if you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - i guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. you do you. godspeed. that would mean the world to me. that would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. and that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.we're fucking people. we still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on reddit and navigate to suicide watch and type a post here. we're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. some of us are only still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. i don't know man. i've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. i just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. it's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say hey don't be sad and they'll be like omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!. you can't go up to a suicidal person and say hey, don't kill yourself. it'd be so much better if you could say hey, i get it. i'm sorry. maybe nobody in your life will miss you. i probably won't miss you either. but i do hope you make it out of this sometime.
i love you all
you guys are practically my second family, even though we share the same pain, you guys have no idea how much you help not only me but many others that goes through these thoughts, this sub has prevented me from ending it many times, just knowing that whenever i feel sad i can come here and relate to so many people and people are whiling to help you, is really overwhelming, so thank you all for being awesome, hopefully one day we can find peace, even if it seams cloudy and rainy outside.
“i hope my death makes more sense than my life.”
quote from joker. feeling depressed today. bipolar is a bitch. felt like sharing.
i've meticulously planned everything to the last detail, but whenever they ask me if i have a plan i say no
such a useless question. you can spend 45 minutes talking about how much you wanna die but if you answer no to that one question they don't think it's serious. if you do say yes they take all your stuff and lock you in a room where you're nothing but a barcode (a literal barcode on your wrist) that they can scan to make sure your misery is expensive enough. then you lie your way out and go back to the world feeling the exact same way at best, but more likely a lot worse. mental health care is an absolute joke. it's literally just trial and error and if anyone says differently they're lying. not only that but they're incentivized to make it take as long as possible so healthcare companies make more money. doctors have been throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks for 5 years for me and nothing has. no medicine, therapy, group, whatever. literally nothing has worked and nothing will.i wanna just throw all my bullshit waste of money meds in the trash, hop in my car and drive across the country and kill myself there if i have to.
my suicide note.
 i don’t feel as if i need to really explain much; you knew i was suffering. admittedly or not; you knew. and you can say i’m selfish.and you can say that i’m a coward. and you can say that i couldn’t have been helped.and you can say that this mindset was a choice.and that you don’t understand.and that you didn’t expect this. and that you wish things were different.and that you’re hurting. but you’ll be okay. and i’m not selfish. and i’m not a coward. and you’re right, maybe i could’ve been saved; but i wasn’t. someone once told me that i wasn’t broken, that i just needed someone to choose me. to love me. and that’s more than true. how can i feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. that i’m special. i am luminous. i am warm.i am beautiful.i am talented. i am smart. i am magnetic.i am powerful. but at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. to enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, just so show that you have me. but my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. and i was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. beautiful they say, precious even. kept safe. appreciated. used when deemed appropriate. treated with care, sure, for the most part—  when treated at all. packed away. and it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.i tried to give myself meaning. to feel loved without touch. but when the only touch i can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, and my voice muted my pain overlookedmy cracks sanded over, but never filledwhat could really be expected?my mother hurt me. she hurt some of you. she hurt herself. and the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. im fucked up because of it. i remember. i remember.i remember. i fucking remember. i wish you’d let me talk about it.i wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.i wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. i wish that i was never told that i was the downfall of our family. because i wasn’t. and news flash: my mother wasn’t either. what happened to her was. and i wasn’t alive yet. i don’t know what happened to her. but something did. and you know. so please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. let this be a lesson. not about how you treated me, because that’s not what i’m getting at. this ain’t about me. let this be a lesson about truth. about honesty. talk about your traumas. i made my own decision, i did. talk so each other. please. i tried. i tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. i tried to create something with what i had.to play the cards i was dealt… but rayvaun if anyone knows i’m awful at card games (did i just joke in my suicide note? yeah i think i did). maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. so i folded. i’m not sorry for what i did, unfortunately. i think this is what i needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. god sent me here to teach a lesson. about truth. about pain. about compassion. about how time doesn’t stop. or something, i don’t know. i don’t have much else to say. i hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the windthat when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin when the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. i wish that kevin could know how much i love him. please take care of him. he’s an angel. truly. here’s to best chances at peace at closure at warmthat forgiveness cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t seeno lies just love like snow like goldi will be pure. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
is anyone else tired of life but too scared to kill themselves?
like i’m too scared of what happens after i die so idkedit: so i got a bible verse and a lot of religious shit from a guy in the dms, i don’t know if ai should turn to religion for comfort tho
how the fuck do you hold conversation?
i have this problem where i can't really make any new friends thanks to me, failing to hold conversation. i'm sick of relying other people to be very talkative and just responding with filler words. ive been stuck with the same friends for years. don't get me wrong i'm thankful to have them in the first place but i feel like i'm starting to grow apart from them. i feel so alone and its all my fault. thanks to me, struggling with meeting new people, keep eye contact, talk until you're comfortable with them etc. there are times where i just feel like i rather be alone than to talk to people. but why do i feel like this? i don't want to be by myself but sometimes i can't help but to only have myself as company.there are times i know the other person just doesn't want to talk to me because i bring up generic topics to talk about (how are you doing? any plans for today? what are you up to now?). but i don't know how to talk... i've been like this for years now. i don't want to stay alone because i end up overthinking everything and think the world hates me. why the fuck am i like this? i need help!
i planned a get together to see my friends one last time and no one came
i didn’t tell them why i wanted to hang out and i planned it a while ago so it wasn’t last minute. everyone flaked. i try not to be a downer when they’re around. i honestly don’t think anyone knows how depressed i’ve been these past few months and i don’t know how to tell anyone. i had a therapist who i’d get all this stuff out to but she left so i haven’t been able to talk to anyone about how hopeless and useless i’ve felt in almost 7 months. i don’t feel like it’s fair to dump it all on my friends and even if i felt i could go to them i don’t know how to tell them.i’ve planned to jump from a bridge on monday january 21st. it’ll been cold enough that if i manage to survive the fall i’ll freeze to death in the river. tomorrow i’m gonna watch the lunar eclipse alone. i’ve always liked stargazing.sorry, i have no one to talk to so i’m just shouting into the internet void again. if you’re reading, thank you for giving me a couple minutes of your time edit: i’m sorry if i’m not responding to some people. i really appreciate your support and i’m trying to but for some reason i get a notification of a comment but it doesn’t appear in the tread. i’m really sorry i promise i’m not trying to be ungrateful or anything edit 2: i really appreciate the support from all of you. i didn’t think this would get so many responses and i’m really sorry if i don’t respond to some because it’s a tad overwhelming. i did read every one and i just want thank you guys for listening to me for a minute. 
tired
anyone else just feel extremely tired all the time? like not wanting to do anything but stay in bed or waste time doing something meaningless?
ever wake up every morning and you want to die?
my depression as constantly began to get worse and worse. it’s been years since my last suicide attempt and i was supposed to try again this year. but then i got a girlfriend, she loves for me cares for me and makes me feel great when we are together. but, even thought we live together i hardly get to see her because she works days and i work graveyard, so when i get home she has to leave. i see here a total of maybe 10 hours a work week. and all those hours i’m away i feel like nothing has changed since before i met her. i go into such deep depressions that i feel like my heart could stop at any moment (wouldn’t be opposed to it anyway). i’m scared to die, but i’m not scared of being dead. the only time i’m happy without her is if i smoke and that last a couple hours tops. i don’t know why i’m so sad. plenty of people have it way worse then me and somehow they are happy without effort. i have it made, good job, love of my life, a place to lay me head at the end of the night. sadness overwhelms me almost daily, i’ve tried everything i can. i wake up ever morning and wish i hadn’t. living seems like an endless battle that i can’t win.  everyone thinks i’m joking when i tell them i want to die, but honestly that’s the most truthful thing to ever leave my mouth. anyone else have the same problem?
i think i have decided to do it.
i have thought about suicide constantly for many years. my entire life, i have felt as though i have been genuinely cursed. truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and i can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. i can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  i have tried holding out, i have tried soldiering on and i have done it for many years, but i live in a constant state of fear and suffering. my sister, who is probably the person i love most in the world, is one of the few reasons i have held on, because i felt that taking my life would hurt her. and i still believe that it would. but i have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. she deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? honestly, i can't fight this anymore. i have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so i can sleep. i just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about if i should do it and more about how i should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people i love the most. i'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train. i don't know why i am posting this, but i just needed to get this off my chest before i do it. thank you for your time and i genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine.
i am a loser, a big failure and forever will be.
i have always been unable to talk with people. i've had no friends ever, fuck i can't even talk to most of my family. i didn't think much of it when i was younger. but now i'm going to college and it's hitting me hard how much of a failure i am. i dropped out of my first one because of crippling anxiety. now i joined another one far from home. now i feel trapped. i'm scared of humans. i look at myself in the mirror and i see an ugly subhuman being unworthy of any love or respect. i know if i go on i won't be a success in life, i won't be happy, i will always be scared of everything and depressed all the time. my mind is too fucked up over the years that i don't think it's even possible to cure. all i can think of now is death. it gives me relief to think of it. so i will soon drive off into a lake and die and hopefully make it look like an accident.edit: thanks for all the kind words guys. even though i don't know a single one of you, it feels good that some of you can understand what i've been going through all my life and took the time to respond to me.
i’m 15 and honestly just have no will to live anymore
it’s like... one good thing happens and then a million shitty things happen and i can’t seem to get one moment where i am ever truly happy. then i’m constantly anxious and paranoid, plus i’ve been hallucinating. what’s the point? the only reason i’ve stayed here past 12 years old is because of my sister and now she’s a little brat who hates me because all i do is stay in bed. my parents don’t say it but i know they are disappointed and wish i was a better child. all i have is my girlfriend who i can’t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before i get the chance to even kiss her for the first time. i can’t open up to anyone close to me because to me it’s not opening up it’s just dumping all my problems on them. i just wish i didn’t fucking exist, that people didn’t care about me and that i could die, or start self-harming in peace again. i mean i did relapse but i can’t even relapse on my wrist so i doesn’t hurt as bad i have to cut on my thighs. i just want it to be over. all of it. my depression, my anxiety, my fucking undiagnosed shit, my family problems, i wish that my ex had never molested me. i just want it to be over and i can’t talk to anyone but internet strangers about it. i’m pathetic.
i am sorry mom and dad.
i want c. to take care of my dog.  i want my father and mother to take over my house. if they don’t want the responsibility, then i wish for them to sell the home and keep the money. because they gave me a second chance at life and put resources into me. it’s the least i can do, allow them to recoup something. i know they would rather have me, they never failed me, but unfortunately i cannot go on anymore.my snap-on toolbox should be given to r.. he can keep my tools.my biological mother l. will get half of my personal belongings, clothes and anything that will help her keep the memories of me.anything else that i own will be donated or thrown away.  this is nobodies fault. so many friends, family, and doctors tried their hardest to save me. please know it’s not your fault. please forgive me. i know that people will question my actions. people will wish i pushed harder and not have done this. i have been in despair for so many years. suffering silently and trying my hardest to get better; to have peace. i unfortunately couldn’t bear the weight of my mental illness. it changed me, ripped away every fiber of my being. left me broken and unrecognizable. i lost everything i love to my sickness. i look in the mirror daily and have no idea who i am. all i see is a deeply broken man. i ask that you keep the memories of me for who i was. the unbroken a.. the comforter, the loving person, the selfless a., the man who breaks bread with strangers in need, the one full of compassion and unconditional love. please don’t remember me for the monster i have become. the angry man, having no patience or control, selfish and hurtful towards those i love; bipolar. i cannot bear that reality. knowing that i am not me anymore. no matter how hard i try, the a. i once was is dead. i miss his softness, his love, his intellect, his ability to understand and protect others. all i am left with is a shell. i look like a.. but i assure you, he is completely dead inside. nothing is left of him. no matter how hard i try, i cannot revive him. he is gone, and i carry the weight of who i once was. no more am i actually alive, my fire is gone, my will to live completely destroyed. i am just a shell now. i have unbearable headaches daily. i can’t speak with articulate words anymore. my emotions are numb now. i don’t feel anything. my mind whispers daily that relief will come only when i give up.  that my peace will come when i quit. i have never been a quitter, i have always been a fighter. but for the first time in my life, i face an enemy whom i cannot defeat. my mind is my enemy now instead of my best friend, as it used to be. i know that people will think i am selfish. i ask you to please not carry this pain. it’s unbearable and not worthy to carry. i wish this cup was not mine to drink from, but the poison has come to me anyways. i know that nobody will get to ask me why? or find the closure they seek. please find closure in this fact. i am sick, if i wasn’t sick i wouldn’t have taken my life. i couldn’t bear this weight anymore. it has destroyed and taken from me everything that i am. my ability to think, my emotions to feel, my fire, my life. it has taken everything that i was. nothing is left of me that is me. i wish i could kill what’s wrong with me and still live. but the reality is that i cannot. please forgive me and allow me the dignity to be remembered for who i was, not what i became. it gives me great shame to know what i am now. to know that my smile is nothing but a mask, my eyes an ocean of despair. i have tried the medications, the therapy, held on to hope. but nothing will fix this. just as cancer takes over a man and steals his life. so it is with my severe mental illness. this is a cancer, invisible, in the mind. nothing can cured this. nothing could have prevented this. i lived a good life. i traveled and felt the world beneath my feet, met good people everywhere i went, and it was beautiful. my life was not lived in vain. i was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. they showed me how to live again. i will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. my life would not have had joy or love without my family. i wish this illness never happened. i have overcome so much in life, but i couldn’t overcome this.  sincerely,a.i know this will hurt, please know it’s not your fault, it’s nobodies fault. with the last piece of love left in my heart, though it is not much, i wish to share it with everyone who knew me. no matter if we had problems, i forgive you, please forgive me.
after 20 years of life no one knows me well enough to give me a eulogy
you ever sit around just picturing your funeral? hell i don’t even want a funeral. no one cared enough to get to know me when i was alive and they surely won’t care when i’m dead. i wish that could actually be arranged. to just get thrown into the ground without a word being said. cause that’s how i lived my life, no one wanted me around alive and i don’t want them around when i’m dying.
i just wish i'd get cancer or some incurable illness
life just isn't worth living. when you've got the unfortunate mix of being unattractive, irratible, and dumb you realize how shitty the world is. i really want to kill myself but i love some people and would feel awful if my suicide effected them, even if it only affects them for a year at most. i just wish i'd get cancer and die so people could say it was bad luck instead.i don't know. maybe i should start smoking cigarettes or something. i wonder how many i'll have to smoke to get the desired results
1 hour to go
i've already made up my mind, nobody can talk me out of it so don't even bother with 'dont do it', pleasei always wanted to feed ducks, never did. i'm partially housebound thanks to agoraphobia and if the ducks touch me i'd have a panic attacks thanks to ocd, so i have never fed ducks.this is just one of the things i never did with my life, i've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing i relived those years. i don't have a gun so my death will be painful as hell but its my only methodedit: i did it, but my instincts are running wild telling me to tell my parents, what do i say to themedit 2: it failed, i'm in the hospital but i won't be admitted to the ward because of my agoraphobia, i wouldn't be able to handle it.updatei tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but i had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.i had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however i fucked up. turns out i was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.i tried to kill myself with citric acid.i didn't even read the back, i'm so fucking stupid. ny organs aren't even partially affected.i was not admitted to the psych ward, but i nearly was. my psychiatrist understood that due to my agoraphobia it would not help to admit me, so he vouched for my discharge, which i was discharged 12 hours after i went to the hospitali had an ecg to check my heart, where i had to take off my shirt, my dad saw my self harm scars. (my mum already knew about it but my dad didn't, he has not mentioned it yet.)
life is a pay to play game with the first 18 years being a free trail and i want to cancel my subscription.

my name is john
i don't know what i'm looking for here. i just want to be heard. i'm posting this on my actual account because i want people to know who i am.every day i wake up to a physical pain in my chest. it's the kind of pain that can't be rid of through aspirin or ibuprofen or tylenol, it's much like hunger, except it can't be satiated. every day i wake up and feel it. but i go to class; i do homework; i smile; i laugh; all because that's what people are supposed to do. i'm supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world. but i can't. i'm tired. i'm sick of it all. i'm sick of being alone. every day i cry. most of the time it's when my roommate is gone, but sometimes i don't have that luxury. i work at my school's library, and the other day i was assigned to sort books. while i was working, i lost it. i had to sit in the bathroom for 10 minutes and try to collect myself. when i finally left, i stared at the same title for 30 minutes, all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it.i just don't know what to do. i've never had a girlfriend, and i was a virgin up until 21 til i finally had enough and paid a prostitute. it was shit. i couldn't perform because i was drunk, and she was obviously just in it for the money. no passion whatsoever. all through high school i watched my friends get in relationships. i listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends. i enjoyed their company, i considered them friends, but every day something inside of me collapsed a little.then, finally, at 22 i met a girl through tinder. i really really really enjoyed talking to her. we talked for like two weeks before we met up, and it was the first time i've been happy in years. every day i was checking my phone multiple times a minute. some people say that a relationship won't fill the hole inside of you, but after that night i can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life. i want someone to want me and enjoy my company. when we met up, i thought things went well. we hooked up. the sex was good - really fucking good - but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me. but a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldn't talk to each other any more. now, this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys, some of whom were one night stands, and kept in touch with *every* other one of them. this was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza, burgers, and french fries, because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down.but *i* was too awkward to keep in touch with. *i* was too much work. and that broke me. whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed. for years, i've tried to socialize. i've tried clubs, i've tried jobs, i've tried talking to people around me in classes, and it hasn't done anything. i thought maybe it was because i wasn't physically attractive, but then i got in shape and it changed nothing. so i gained a little weight back, and then i met her. i had a chance with a girl. i thought she liked talking to me as i liked talking to her. but i was wrong.through her i discovered the truth; i'm fundamentally flawed. i can't socialize. i'm not attractive. there is *nothing* physically impressive about me. i have no hobbies. i'm boring as shit. i'm awkward. i have no redeeming qualities *at all*. i don't know what to do about it either. i tried a number of hobbies. skateboarding, puzzles, reading, television, exercise, drawing, instruments, etc. it all bored the shit out of me. i had *zero* fun. i lie to everyone. i tell people i got laid in high school. i tell them i had a good size friend group. the truth is, i've never had more than a couple friends at a time, and i've never been in a relationship. every day this eats me up. every day i wake up, i'm disappointed that i didn't fucking die in my sleep.
the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my wife and daughter. i am beginning to resent them for it.
i've talked to two therapist. they both encourage me to get a divorce (after a lot of therapy). the issue is, i really think i can't handle the stress of a divorce. i love my daughter very much, and i want to see her grow up. however, i feel like a fucking robot that can't make anyone happy. i work harder and people ask for more of me.both my parents have died in the past year and my last words to both were fuck you (one deservedly, one not so much). i came from very humble beginnings and worked myself into management and after my dad died my work went to shit and i am getting canned. i just don't want to do any of this anymore, but i do becauee i have to. not sure what i need or if i need anything from here, but it feels better to type it. 8 times i have had serious thoughts about suicide this year, everytime i think of my daughter and realize i can't.the only thingnthatbreally help is smoking shittons of weed which, of course, leaves my wife dissappointed in me (i have been approved by a physician and live in an legal state. my younger brother is in jail and the whole system isndesigned tontake money from families and with me losing my job, it is expenaive to even talk to him.our world is cruel and i don't want to live in it.i spent 10 years in the army and did 3 tours in a combat arms job. i've earned real medals (bronze star with a v, arcom with a v) for actions in combat. no one gives a shit. no one cutsbyou any slack for killing for college money. for digging up ieds for a poverty wage. for losing friends. and all i am is a disposable piece in this machine, school, work, the government, family. it's all just people in a line waiting for their piece of me.all this world and the people in it want is to take. i have nothing left to give. i am dead inside. i'll wake up and do it again tomorrow. i will wake up, get the babybready while my wife takes a shower. drop off the baby. and gontrain my replacement and apply for jobs that will reject my resume. i'll home and work on my mba homework so i can go hate my life for hopefully more money down the road. fuck this all.
my dad hanged himself today
i'm in bed now and i just need to write down my thoughts. he was a difficult man, in the sense that his upbringing didn't allow him to believe that he was worthy of love if he wasn't succesful. i just found out that for the past year he'd been covering up the fact that his second company (he lost the first one, worth millions, during the housing crisis) was failing. he'd been getting in with some bad people to stay afloat apparently and he was getting in debt with them too. he just took his life, leaving only a note saying he had a lot of debt and he couldn't deal with it anymore. not so much as a 'i love all of you'.my mother is devastated. me and my sister are just trying to be there for her...but to be honest. i've also been struggling with depression my entire life. me and my dad were very much alike and related so much on that level. i thought he was the strongest person i knew. he was literally my hero.and now i'm just wondering what this all means. how could he have done this? my mom is feeling guilty about being angry but... we are all literally heading for immanent financial ruin. we will lose everything. he was the breadwinner.i just wish he would have talked to us. i miss him so much already. he was my best friend. where do i go from here...
planned to kill myself today
january and february was the darkest time in my life and i decided that 18 april would be the most suitable day to end my life. just like the stupid human i am, i made reminders on my calendar to remind me that it's time. the second reminder was to make an appointment with a psychiatrist for my family. everything was sorted. but when the day came, i don't even remember what i had planned until i saw the reminder. life gets better, it will go downhill too but only to rise again. this gave me hope to continue. maybe i'll be stronger the next time a wave of sadness hits me.
my cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago.
my cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago. they were having a fight; she was angry and vindictive like always, they were screaming and arguing at each other. he was fed up with her shit and finally decided to leave her. she called the cops. he got in his car to leave. he's got a gun she screams. my cousin puts his hands up. cops think he's raising a gun and they shoot him 14 times. my cousin is left in a semi comatose state. over the next couple of weeks the hospital sends us updates of his condition; they claim he's improving rapidly and regaining neural and motor functions. it was all lies, he died in the hospital one week later. the cops claim he was standing when he pointed a gun at them and they acted in self defense. more lies. the ballistics show that he was sitting in the car when he was shot.  for the longest time i never accepted that he was dead, it just never seemed real to me and for the longest time i have been suppressing my emotions but recently this horrible feeling of dread has been seeping over me. the thought of death or dying sends me into a state of intense anxiety complete with panic attacks. i cant take this anymore; every time it happens i just think over and over again why me  why did things have to be like this i wish i never even had these thoughts i don't want to feel like this anymore. this is no way to live i shouldn't have to feel like this every day. i want to die. but i cant. it would cause my family too much grief and they would never understand why i did it. the last thing i want to do is to spread grief to my family. i wish i had never of been born so i would never have to experience these feelings.(i apologize for this rambling wall of text, i am an awful writer)
i tried hanging myself but feel happier
i tried hanging myself a couple hours ago. i had planned it all day. i even asked for help for the first time ever. but still up until the hanging i felt hopeless. it didn’t work because i hung it too low and i was able to push myself out before i could breath my last breath. i took down the rope, got into bed, finished homework due today i guess and here i am. i feel happy though. not happy to be alive but just happy that a part of me is still fighting to live. i’m not sure how long this feeling will last but i do still intend on getting help because i’m worried that one day, when i’m not ready for it, i’ll just give up. i’m not sure where to go from here or how to hide the burning red mark across my neck but i do know i’m the happiest i’ve been in a while.
suicide hotlines are bullshit

in few hours it’s over
shortly after midnight (between 2:00-3:00) i’m going to hang myself. i refused to live a hopeless, pathetic and miserable life anymore. i’ve written a very short note to my mother. i’m terrified but i must do it.fuck you cruel world!edit: thank you for the positive comments but i’m domed. believe me i badly want to live and in the past 4 years i did everything i could to feel better but i don’t belong in this world. where i’m it’s 23:00 so i’ve 3-4 hours left. only reason i will wait for few hours is so i can do it when everyone is asleep. i don’t want to be interrupted.
i can't wake up at 8am and work until 6pm every day until i'm 70. i just can't.
i wasn't made for this society. i'm too weak. i can't keep doing this forever. i feel so drained.
reddit was the best and worst thing i have discovered
it all started with studying for the sat, i created a reddit account to join r/sat to get extra resources and help. but then i discovered other communities of reddit...until i dawned upon r/suicidewatch. i spend hours on this sub. i’m so entranced by the resilience of others and what they have overcame thus far. but more selfishly i’m addicted to being heard. i’m addicted to voicing my sadness, my anger, my guilt etc. i love how ppl response and i love how ppl care. i crave this feeling real life but i know this fantasy will never be realized. however, this has proved catastrophic for me. i spend so much time on this sub and neglect all my other responsibilities.
my mom mocked my suicidal tendencies before running off to the bar
help. mother’s day and such
i did it.... (trigger warning: suicidal ideation, suicidal gestures, hospitalization)
tldr at endi have been passively suicidal for some time. lately, it had become more active; i was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression, anxiety, and burnout due to the amount of stress i was under. last monday night, i took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation. i obviously failed, but i felt strange... unfulfilled? i didn’t sleep that night; i just cried. tuesday i went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while i was training new employees. i just got this sudden, overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night’s failure. i also got a snap of lucidity. i blurted out to my office manager “i need to go to the hospital” and left work. when i got to the er, and was standing at the front desk, the triage nurse asked me what brought me in. i looked at her and just said “i am having a mental breakdown” and started sobbing uncontrollably. they immediately brought me back to the safe observation room, had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood. they had me strip and put me in safety clothes (paper patient scrubs) and the er doc came and interviewed me first. the er doc decided i needed a psych evaluation, which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on. at some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues, and i just started laughing. uncontrollably. the nurse looked troubled by this. she asked if that was normal for me and i said yes, especially when i was really stressed and anxious. she started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment; full or partial hospitalization. it was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment i should receive. she told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization. i asked if i had a choice in this matter and she just said “no, as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a 72 hour hold. we are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through.”i just kind of chuckled and said “that’s fair.”the three days went by slowly. no tech, no outside contact. just treatment groups (i painted a recipe box, drew a picture of a tree, learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself), mealtimes (we got a choice of what we wanted, within reason... and no sharp edges), and meeting with doctors, social workers and your assigned nurse. at the end of my involuntary hold, they asked if i was ready to be discharged from inpatient, and i said yes. 4 hours later i was released to the world, but not fully from the hospital. i was placed in partial hospitalization: weekdays i have to check into the program at 7:30, and get out at 3. they are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such. i have my first full day of php on monday. i always avoided seeking help. when i went to the hospital, i had truly given up. they were nothing but nice to me, and being cared for gave me hope for the future. if you feel suicidal or self harmful, it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital. the cost can seem prohibitive. the social stigma can be repulsive. admitting you need help can seem impossible. i’m not paying for my hospitalization or php; the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold. no one knows why you are there (or if you even are there) unless you tell them or give the staff permission. and if you are on this board... you have already admitted you need help. i have learnt a lot the past several days. i entered with an open heart and nothing to loose, and grew because of it. please, consider going to the hospital. tldr: tried suicide for the hundredth time, had mental breakdown, admitted myself to the hospital, got better.
why is so damn hard to kill yourself when it seems so easy in stupid movies and shows. i hate everything.

i wanna fucking die.
thank you for coming to my ted talk.
i tried to hang myself tonight
self-explanatory.  the rope wasn't long enough, i couldn't make a secure knot over the light fixture. i kicked the chair, felt the pull on my neck and it immediately came loose and i fell on my back. got right back up and tried again, same thing. i can't do anything right. i wish it had worked. i'm so tired. i'm tired of myself. i'm tired of my shitty artistic projects that go nowhere and don't amount to anything. i'm tired of my job. i'm tired of school. i'm tired of everyone treating me like i'm not a human being or i'm invisible. i'm tired of the citizens bank atm that never works. i'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to everyone.  i'm tired of all of the thoughts i can't stop and the emotional trauma i'm going through. it just keeps getting worse and worse and i just want it to end.  the person i love the most continuously treats me like nothing.  i tried to stop drinking and cutting and everything's just gotten worse.  things keep setting me off and i don't know how much longer i can keep this up. i'm going to buy a longer length of rope tomorrow.  i feel like everyone would be better off if i was dead and everyone would love me more. everyone loves someone more when they're dead and i don't feel like anyone does now and its all i want.  i know everyone will move on and be fine and i'm tired of being a disappointment and a burden.   i can't even talk about what's driving me the most with anyone because it makes me feel ashamed and humiliated. its never going to stop. god i just wish it had worked tonight. i'm very drunk, i'm sorry.
my friend (15f) is going to kill herself in less than a month.
this is a call for help.i met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. she was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. since we had similar classes, she and i got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.things seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. she often slept at school, and started skipping classes. at first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.one day, i noticed cuts on her arm, around late october.  i immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the vice principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). after getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.on the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. she was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).when she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. he would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.after her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. there was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. an incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. when she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. this was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). she was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.she has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and i think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.right now, only one other friend and i know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. so far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.we came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:* what are the things we should be doing? and how? the adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)* what should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?* since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and i know. as far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. feel free to ask anything to clarify and i will do my best to answer with what i know.&#x200b; **edit**thank you so much for all the advice and responses. my friend and i have talked it through and, i called the suicide hotline. after explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most i could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. if it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.to clarify some things:whether we want to or not, it’s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there’s three weeks to the end of the holidays. as far as i know, all the adults around me would rather i stay away rather than help which is why i asked for their help. all of our parents are quite strict as well, she’d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. and when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.i’ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you’ve given us. i might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health. thank you so much for all the support you’ve given me, and i hope this turns out well for everyone.
i want to overdose on sleeping pills and alcohol.
i'm 27. haven't finished school. work a crappy job. going through a divorce because of toxic relationship. given up all my friends because of toxic relationship. hard to make friends at my age, and because i have social anxiety. tried to make friends but none of them care enough to ask how my day was or even ask if i'm okay. i'm not close with my family. i don't know what to do with my life and it seems pointless to continue living through all this pain. i always feel alone and i am alone. i could die tonight and nobody would check on me for a week to see if i'm alive.
going to leave my suicide letter here
i only have ever wanted to feel love.  i’ve always wanted to be loved.  but i struggle to feel connected to people, i struggle to believe that anyone in my life loves me.  i’m deeply convinced that nobody does.  if there’s anything that i’ve learned in life, it’s that people can really fucking leave you.  and i could never understand why.  but “love” has always been conditional - be good, behave, don’t let your sadness show - and only then you’ll be loved.  it’s my fault people leave.  i always do something to mess it up.  because i’ve never understood how to relate to others.  people have told me i’m too difficult to love.  people have left me after seeing how sad and anxious i really get.  i’ve been told my entire life that my body is not okay and not worthy of being seen.  i’ll never forget the therapist that ruined my life forever.  he diagnosed me, looked me right in the eyes, and told me i’d never have normal relationships ever again.  my life felt like it ended that day.  i was fifteen.  i’ve never been the same since.  since then, i’ve felt like i was born wrong.  my entire existence was a mistake.  i was inherently beyond repair.  nobody would ever love me again.  rejection.  over and over again.  i’m not worth being loved.  i’m not worth anyone’s time.  i don’t deserve safety or comfort.  i feel empty.  i can’t see any life in my own eyes anymore.i’ve hung on as long as i could in the hopes that someone would just stay with me.  i’ve bargained with myself, i’ve said well, if no one can love me, i’ll let someone abuse me if it meant they just stayed in my life.and now, i’m almost 29, and i am truly alone.  i have no one i can talk to.  no one that knows just how dark it really gets sometimes.  i feel connected to no one.  i don’t feel safe around anyone.  friendships feel superficial.  dating and relationships are far too difficult.  sex doesn’t feel good.  companionship seems impossible.  i don’t have anyone.maybe there are some people in the world that are just kind of meant to be discarded and forgotten about.  maybe i’m one of those people, even though i’ve tried to make something of myself.i just wanted to be loved.  that’s all.  i just wanted to know what love feels like so bad.my therapist was really my last hope that maybe someone could stay in my life.  that maybe someone liked me.  i haven’t been able to cope without her.  now that she’s out of my life, i truly am alone.  i don’t have anyone i feel like i can depend on anymore.  no one that supports me.  no one i can talk to.honestly, in my wildest fantasies, i just wanted someone to hold me and tell me they love me.  tell me i’m a good kid.  that i’m doing a good job.  that i’m a sweet boy.  that i’m lovable.  that they will stay with me.  that i’m good enough.  that my body is okay and nothing is wrong with it.  that i don’t need to work so hard to get people to like me.  i wish someone could just look at me and tell me i’m okay exactly as i am.   being good enough is really one of my wildest dreams.  as long as i can remember, i’ve never been good enough and i always put in so much effort to make up for it in other ways.  but it’s exhausting now.  i’m tired. i don’t want to do this, but i know i have to.  after my body is found and i’m confirmed dead, i’d like to be cremated.  all of my belongings can be discarded.  my cats can go to loving homes - i’m hoping maybe people i know.  my social media can be taken down.  i imagine work and life will go on as normal.  if my body is found and i’m not dead - i do not want to be on life support, i do not want to be resuscitated, i don’t want to be in any kind of vegetative state.  i do not want any type of end of life care.  i want to be euthanized as quickly as possible.  under no circumstances do i want to be kept alive.  i’m sorry.  i just wanted to know what love felt like.
does anyone else on this sub feel like there’s an invisible anchor dragging you down? at this point i’m sick of fighting it and i just want to drown
one minute i’ll be walking down the street. everything’s fine, i love walking, don’t you know endorphins are supposed to be the body’s natural heroin, and then suddenly i feel myself slowing down.my footsteps become heavier to the point i’m trudging on the sidewalk and i feel like i’m a thousand pounds.it gets to the point where my feet are made of lead and i can’t even walk anymore. i can’t even stay still, i just want to lay on the concrete and let people step on me, whatever. it’s like there’s this anchor and it’s dragging me down and i just want to slip under because all my life i’ve been falling and i’ve finally gotten to the place where i can’t climb back out. everything requires a monumental effort, except for my suicidal thoughts which pop into my head like spam emails. i just want it to stop. and suicide feels like my only way out.i just want to feel lighter. 
it is my birthday today and it is a huge milestone for me. :)
about a month ago, i was sure i was going to die by suicide pretty soon, and i was sad that i wouldn't make it until my birthday. but here i am right now, i am really proud of myself for making it this far and my depression is finally starting to pass. thank you all.
anybody else ever feel like you've probably got a few conditions that are un-diagnosed?
sometimes i wonder how many mental illnesses i'd get a diagnosis for if i actually had the energy or time to go to a psychiatrist.
update
i posted here recently about being homeless and sleeping under a bridge in canada. due to everyone's help and kind words, i'm in a shelter now hoping to get back on my feet in an actual home asap. thank you very much to everyone who helped me this far! bit nervous so pray everything goes smoothly
does anyone else just feel like you’ve lived enough?
im out of my severely depressed phase but i have no motivation to do anything. no job, no friends nearby....i feel like i’ve lived enough.
i wish i could trade places with kids that are actually abused.
because, then, i’d actually have a real excuse as to why i’m like this. i wish my family didn’t love me. i wish they’d beat me. i wish i was raped. i wish i could take the place of every actually abused kid, because they don’t deserve to be hurt. my mom is so loving it makes me feel terrible. when she gets me donuts in the morning. when she brings me breakfast and i don’t do shit for her. my grandfather, whom i live with, is working his ass off most nights, and yet i can’t even be bothered to pick up the trash i leave around the house, or go outside to help him with groceries. maybe it’s my mental illness talking, but i genuinely hate how i am. how everything i do is selfish and how uncaring and unhelpful i am. a few months ago, i was practically begging my mom to take her anger out on me, to beat me, because i wanted an excuse to be depressed. i wanted to be traumatized, like she was from her own past. they buy me so many electronics i shouldn’t even have. i’ve dropped out of school, and when i was in school i’d missed so many days a school councelor visited my home. i’d ran away so many times, worrying them until their worry turned to anger. they’ve given me everything, and yet i’m so ungrateful.
how do you convince yourself to continue living when it just seems much easier if you kill your self because your life isn’t going to be any better how hard you try and the trauma will not disappear.

does anyone else have things that happen in their lives that your immediate reaction to is, i should kill myself? because that's nearly everything to me.
no friends. i should kms. everyone around me in school hates me. i should kms. ex-friends around me all the time. kms. ex-lovers around me all the time. kms. classes are anxiety inducing and terrible. kms. my past? kms. my present? kms. my future? k.m.s.
i participated in a suicide prevention walk yesterday and it made me feel more suicidal
i hoped that participating in this walk would give me hope, and help me see how much suicide impacts the lives of the people left behind. instead, i felt miserable. everyone was writing messages for people they've lost to suicide and hanging them up for everyone to see. i feel so incredibly screwed up saying this, but as i read the messages, i was envious of the people they wrote about. i was jealous they had the guts to go through with it because i know i don't. this is my first time saying this out loud, because i am so fearful of being judged, but it feels good to get it off my chest.
social anxiety is pushing me to suicide
everyday is suffering with social anxiety. the only time i feel ok is when i'm at home. having to suffer 40 hours a week every week makes me question whether life is even worth it.
it's so hard to find meaning after rock bottom...
in the last 6 years i lost my mother to a sudden illness (amyloidosis) married the love of my life, found a successful career with a sweet company car, bought a house, succumbed to alcoholism, attempted suicide, lost my father to alcoholic dementia, lost my my wife, car, house and my job.  i was sober for about 8 months but have been struggling for the last 4 months, jobless in a town without anyone but my 97 year old grandmother.  i've been hiding my relapse from everyone.  i flipped out on a friend on facebook and said something that really turned the knife in me.  he spewed off all his accomplishments -- owner of two companies, wife and 4 kids, head of three community boards, two houses and then said, and what about you?  are you even recovered?but honestly, what does all those things even mean?  do they matter?  do i matter?  does it really matter to anyone if i recover?  the stigma is so terrible with addiction that the first thing he went for was that.  he was right, but that just reinforces that addicts are the scum of the earth, and i'm one of them.so is it really worth it?  we're on an over populated planet with people fighting for their piece of the pie.  do i deserve anything?
the only thing keeping me alive is the fear that i’ll survive
i’m afraid that i’ll survive and become physically deformed and mentally handicapped. this is one of the few things that will make my pointless life even worse. even if i somehow do survive without any of this happening to me, i will be forced to be medicated and forced to go to therapy. everyone would just see me as a person who attempted suicide and not a normal person for the rest of my life.
72, female, helpless, useless and unable to cope
i am 72.  last year my husband of 50 years decided to divorce me.  i have total income of $1100.00.  can't find a residence for less than $850.inclluding utilities.  don't know how to be poor.  have debts that are huge.  have no living family.  soon won't be eating and don't care to go to the food bank.  social services won't help because i have 10k in the bank.  i've had and been treated for depression since i was 15.  the meds work ok normally, but these are not normal times for me.  i can't last much longer.  i struggle each night to not finish it all.  one night it will be too strong an urge.  i look forward to that day.
people don't actually care
isn't it funny to see how people always say things like i'm here for you and all that bullshit when you're gonna commit suicide? but when you're not committing suicide, they don't care. people leave you when you say you feel down, that you need somebody. yet these same people are the ones that'll go i care about you when shit goes down.people lie. nobody cares about you. we're all worthless, like life itself.
17 days later

my camp was destroyed, i'm going to hang myself
i went into the town centre today to hand my cv into as many places as possible, i managed to get a hot meal from a local church before heading home. while i was gone (9+hours) someone had broken into my camp and destroyed my tent with everything inside then lit it on fire...karma is a bitch. i deserve this.i can't do this anymore, i don't have the energy to continue.i take one step forward and it life sends me ten steps back.i'm done, i'm ready to see my family again, i'll see them soon.i'm going to use the spare cord from the tent that wasn't destroyed and hand myself.this is goodbye, andrew.
how do you even respond to a suicide hotline when they ask “how can i help you”
i don’t know!!! i don’t know how to answer that!! there’s probably nothing you can personally do to make sure i don’t off myself tonight!!! normally if the person picks up and says how can i help you i just hang back uptonight i tried to call them three times over the span of a few hours and i just don’t even know how to start a conversation maybe it’s a sign from god or some shit that i really should just throw myself off the bridge next time
i understand suicide now. trust me, it's not a choice. it's an action.
i was abused last year, and i've paid dearly for it. pretty much with my life. the same people who didn't understand me when i called for help, blamed it on me. everything has been taken away from me, including my dignity and personality. people help you but they get tired and then they think you're a liar. i just want to say that if you're out there, and you've had suicidal thoughts, i totally understand. i get it now. i believe that those who suicide are too pure for this world. the most beautiful souls don't fit in here. it's always the good ones that suffer.i'm with you. just know that i know. i know that feeling. the world thinks it understands, but it doesn't. i'm there with you in this moment, in that feeling you have. in the pain. in the misunderstanding, in the absense of justice. i don't have an answer and i don't have any comforting words, but i'm with you.
i'm worthless
i'm 14m, my dad is a pussy, my mom is abusive and screams at me for taking his [my dad's]side whenever i try to stop her. at school i barely have friends and those that i do don't really like me they're just trying to be nice.i am so hopelessly ugly that it's 100% guaranteed i will never have a girlfriend. this is not a body image issue, it's just a issue of my bad face. and i'm a guy. i'm 5'8 and not growing anymore too, just to make things worse.i've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. i am never happy anymore at all. just more misery every day.i also have irritable bowel syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.my parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). which means i have zero social skills. i don't even have the building blocks for social skills. i've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 i had never even talked to another person under 18. i wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, i was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. my parents were both extreme nerds with 130 iqs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). i just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is friday which means i can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. final exams that will result in punishment if i don't get a+, in my family i'm told i'm an idiot who needs tutoring if i get an a not an a+. b's are grounds for punishment. no, i'm not asian.i just wish i had someone to be with or something to do, all i do is make people uncomfortable. some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.nothing will change when i get older. i'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if i get to be 18 i'll just be an i*cel. and even if i get a good job or have any academic success, it's all pointless, nobody likes me and i enjoy absolutely nothing. i want to die, a lot. but i'm also afraid that there's no afterlife and it's going to be a black void. that's as much a possibility as heaven or hell. i really don't want to be lonely for all eternity.
passive suicidalness
does anyone else feel very detached from life? not like in a i want to die way but i wouldn't mind if i got hit by a car or contracted a terminal illness. i think my perspective comes from years of being depressed and actively suicidal, such that death really doesn't scare me or even really matter to me. it feels like living in an ocean, with no shore in sight - sometimes it peaceful, and the ocean is manageable. but sometimes there's a storm and it's all i can do to keep my head above water. and no matter how good i get at treading water, inevitably the only way to go is down.i'm tired of treading water, tired of working so hard just to survive, tired of dreading the next storm.
i'm in the queue for a suicide chat and there's 54 people ahead of me
it's kind of depressing that there are so many of us.
why can’t i just be shot already
just fucking shoot me already. i cant do this anymore god fucking dammit. why cant the world just give up on me already and kill me
to my boyfriend
he's done more for me then he will ever know. i was planning to kill myself after school in early june. i planned it for almost a week. when the day came, i was still low enough to go through with it. i was set on it. however, during last period, he said something. he said he wanted to commit the act of falling on a sword (don't remember the word). he's suicidal as well, as well as most of my friends, so suicide jokes are common. what stopped me was what he said after. he said he would've done it already if it weren't for me. this changed my view instantly, and i didn't do it. it made me feel needed, and not completely worthless. the day after that day was actually a bit better, and it stayed a bit better. i haven't been that low since. it's still hard to deal with, but it's more bearable now. if i had actually done it, i would most likely be dead right now. i could never thank him enough, but i'll never be able to tell him. i love him so much.
i want to die.
i want to just vanish.
tell me i'm not the only one that do this
sometimes i 'play' dead. let me explain myself before you think i'm nuts. i stop breathing on purpose for as long as i can, and i pretend to be found dead. my body relaxes and i tilt my head to one side. my body is limp and unresponsive to any stimulation. somehow, it calms me down when i'm having a crisis, because it is a dream that i can't make come true. i can't leave my family, since they would never forgive me.am i the only one that do this?
does anyone else feel like suicide is the way they're meant to go?
i don't think that's the right way to phrase it but i really don't care about anything right now. the way i feel right now, and have for the longest time, is not something i can deal with forever. i don't know when i'll die, this year, next year, whenever, but i'm almost 100% sure that it'll be by my own hand. it feels like it's inevitable.
nobody knows who i am. remember me. please.
i'm sorry this is so long.nobody knows who i am. i haven't had a friend in years. i don't remember what friendship was like. when i talk to people, something always feels off, as if i'm speaking a different language or something. i just want someone to know me. it's so lonely and cold and empty and i just want to scream so loud that i hurt myself.i was born in alabama. i was an accident, my dad was and still is a meth addict. my mom is great and has raised me all these years. she left my real dad when his addiction got too bad. i was about 2 or 3, maybe younger. we moved to a new town, she met a new guy. my step dad. he was good at first. we moved to texas for his new job, he broke. something in his changed. he became abusive. he didn't hit me, and he only hit my mom once, but he was verbally and emotionally abusive. she was with him from when i was in first grade to fifth grade. he started storing food and water in his room. note, his room. my mom slept in my room with me because she hated him. he thought we were going to poison him. both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time, and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night.even though i was going through this, those were the happiest years of my life. or maybe i'm just looking back with rose tinted glasses. at school i had so many friends and everyone liked me. everyone though i was funny. in fifth grade my depression and anxiety started. i started to realize i was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about. they started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras. my best friend was a boy named ben. i loved him and i still do. i think about him a lot. his dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was gay to be a close friend with a girl. he pushed me away and now he's gone. i got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me. it was for a pep rally. i was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that. they changed it at the last second, had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead. so they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it. i froze and everyone laughed at me. or maybe they didn't, i don't know what's real and what's my anxiety imagining things anymore. i started lying a lot around this time too. not to my parents, by to everyone else. i made up elaborate fake lives, i still do. they're nothing special, just, different.my mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade. i had to keep visiting him for a while. he had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadn't left. one time i was at his house, my old house, and tried to run away because i was scared of him. he caught me and called the police on me. i don't know why. my neighbors were watching and called my mom. they were good people. the policeman got there and said i was lying. he told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head. then, he forced me to hug my step dad while i screamed and cried in fear. that memory is one of the worst ones i have. he left, and i had to stay at my dads house still. he blackmailed my mom into giving him everything. the money, the car, the house, my dog. just out of spite. i miss her. her name was ginger. she'd probably be around 10 years old right now if she is still alive. i don't know if she is. i miss her even after all this time. we packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to alabama. i lost everything. i started to realize i was different in middle school. i did weird things, i acted weird. i would touch other people's hair becuase i liked the way it looked. i still acted like a very young child even at 11. don't know why. i didn't have a single friend in 6th grade. in 7th grade, i became truly depressed. i did ha e someone though. her name was mary. she's gone now too.in 8th grade, i had a bigger group of friends. everyone still thought i was weird though. i still did weird things, dressed weird too. i know there's probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed. she thinks medicine is bad. pills specifically. that's why i'm not allowed any anti depressants either. when highschool started, my social anxiety was so bad that i started homeschooling. the homeschooling laws are so lax in alabama that i barely did anything except play the sims all day. in 10th grade, we became poor. lost the car, lost everything almost. she got a new job in ohio, we moved again. i lost all of my friends again.i homeschooled at first, then started going to the local highschool. i thought everything had changed, that i could be normal. it was hell. everyone hated me. my favorite memory is when i walked into a room to get something, only to hear does she seriously dress like that? wow.. it hurt. we were still pretty poor and i was doing the best i could. all of my clothes were from goodwill. there was one guy there who was nice to me. his name was evan. i hope he has a good life, he was one of the best people i've ever met.luckily i'm kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early, so for 11th grade that's what i've been doing. it's so lonely. it's so fucking lonely i just want to scream and scream and scream but i can't. i've never know what it's like to be in love with someone who loves you. i've never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close. i feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me i'm not. i posted on amiugly and everyone said i was pretty, i thought it would help but it didn't. i've become very paranoid. i'm scared all of the time that people are out to get me, that my life is a simulation, that i'm dead. i talk to myself. either comforting words telling myself it's ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt i am. i'm scared.i told my mom about the depression, and the anxiety. she doesn't know i'm suicidal. that i've been planning out what best way to end it for months. i can't go to therapy. there's a huge scholarship learning abroad program i'm signing up for and they won't let me go if i'm a fucking loon. so i'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. the only reason i haven't ended it is because i want someone to remember me, to mourn me, other than my mom. i have a sister. i only found out about her when i was 11ish. she's my half sister in my dads side. i don't know how old she is anymore. i was so happy to meet her. it was so good to have a sibling. i felt like i had a real family. she left for college and immediately stopped talking to me. i haven't heard from her in years. the last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago. i miss her. she was good. her and my dad won't even know i'm dead. my last birthday was sad. i had been planning out my sweet 16 for years. i didn't have any birthday parties for years because i wanted to have one big one. when it finally came around, i didn't have anybody to invite. it was just me and my mom. i ate some cake, opened my presents, and played video games. not terrible at all, but not what i had been dreaming of since childhood.i'm supposed to turn 17 next month. march the 20th. please remember me. please if you have the time, read my story. you'll be the only people to know it except for me. i hope you remember me. i just want someone to know me again. it's so cold being alone.goodbye-mimi edit: i didn't think people would care this much. the support i have received from all of you is legitimately amazing. so, thank you. i think i'm going to try and get some help, even if i have to put my studies on hold. im trying to reply to everyone, sorry that it's taking so long.see you later-mimi 
why don't you get a girlfriend?
what the fuck.what the actual fuck.how the fuck can you be so fucking casual about this?i've heard this from counselors. i've heard this from therapists. the cocksucking psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ptsd, mdd and bpd (borderline traits) told me this.how the actual fuck can people be so fucking casual about a romantic relationship?do y'all mfs just think i can go to amazon and order one?i- i don't get it. i don't get it.  i don't fucking get it. what the fuck.like i'm supposed to just go up to a girl i like and say hey i like u let's date because my psychiatrist said so fuck you you trivialising pieces of human trash.fuck you.fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.and fuck you fuck you fuck you for even trying to tell me that there's any chance in the fucking world that a girl can like anything about me, because i can guaran-fucking-tee you that in the 5 years since i first went on meds, since i first went to therapy, after all the working out and hospitalizations, i've only become worse.fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever i say i'm unlovable you fucking professionals. fuck you for not taking me seriously when i literally carved the word unlovable all over my body.fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. i didn't go to you just because i saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. i didn't go to you just because i was and still am constantly bullied for the way i look and act. no one will ever fucking love me for any part of what i am or do, and your amazing lack of sympathy and downright intolerance for that fact, the kind of intolerance that lead you to actually get angry at me at even suggesting the idea that girls don't like fat, ugly guys, you fucking professional, it's truly incredible. leaving meds and help behind didn't make my life better, but it's really amazing how little leaving medical help behind affected me; life was and is getting worse, i was and am and will be unlovable, i should've and need to kill myself as soon as fucking possibleso stop treating girlfriends like it's just another pill you can prescribe. not only is it not a poor girl's job to fix me or handle the burden of my bullshit, it's certainly not your right to tell me to find love when i'm sitting at your fucking desk because love and kindness won't ever be a part of my life you ignorant fuck i hope someone forces you to eat the curb may your jaw turn to ashes
i'm gonna probably attempt to kill myself sometime during college
for so many years i've been putting it off, because people have been telling me no dont die and hobbies keeping me from doing it but looking on how i've reacted to and treated people, my sensitivity towards everything, i'm going to kill myself. even if i were to continue living what's the point? i'm so replaceable, i lack self confidence to the point where i feel awful about letting people down when i mention that i'm sad.i'm going to do this. plan and all. giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before i do it. at least they have a better look on to why i did it. not gonna lie, kinda scared, but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different? i can literally write anything here about how i'm going to end it and no one i know will find it. not that they would like what i've written. i dont care that i have potential. i don't care that i have opportunities. i just want to die after putting it off for so long.i hope people care less seeing that i'm an adult. just to see that i'm just another cog in the machine.edit: this got a lot of attention wow. thank you guys so much for the support! especially right now when i'm gonna start college soon. this has really got me to think about where i'm going with this and i'm gonna try and get it out of my system. even tho these thoughts might come back, at least i know where to go when they do.
ever feel like you're the most fucked up person in the world and no matter how much effort you put in, you will always be alone and unloved?
why is the title so long
i want to go to my therapist just to tell her to fuck off.
i started seeing a therapist. this lady i actually liked. she told me the next time i wanted to cut myself or really wanted to kill myself, to go to the emergency room. i did that. she told me they would give me attention and medication and really help me. i stayed there over night about 8 hours. a therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for 8 hours. i had to use a prison toilet - in socks. she said i think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. that’s it. yesterday i got a bill in the mail for $3,711. for that one night where they did nothing. nothing. i had to reschedule my appointments this month because i just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. i have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? after insurance? for locking me in a room so i could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. how pathetic do i feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. a lot of my unnecessary stress is money. why is it so expensive to get help? why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? it’s so fucking expensive. getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live. i now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health. fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist. i plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me. i’m really hurt because i trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse. i hate myself so much and it made me feel even more worthless. i won’t cuss at her or disrespect her but this is my life. i went to her for help. i needed someone who could really help and now i can’t trust any of them. 
being gay and ugly sucks
i’m so fucking worthless. no one wants me and i’m done trying. i’m gonna kill myself. i hate myself for being ugly. my body dysmorphia has gotten worse recently. i can barely eat anything, and i harm myself a shit ton. i think it’s about time to kill myself.
why do i keep going?
i wake up and wonder, why?  why do i keep getting up and doing this over and over?  it's the same thing.  get up, go to work, eat dinner, sleep.. repeat.  why?  what's the point to any of this?  i didn't ask to be here.
my cousin/roommate assaulted me last night.. nobody believes me..
my cousin(roommate) assaulted me last night... nobody believes me...i moved in with my cousin two weeks ago.. since then he’s been overly loving. he will wake you up and talk to you all day. literally, the first day there he talked to me for 9 hours straight... even when i went to the bathroom. i have a problem getting black out drunk and he brags about kissing me, watching me in the shower, watching me in the restroom, seeing me naked, i know it’s forced because i don’t like physical contact and i’m asexual that he forces me to cuddle with him when i’m blacked out and don’t remember. he found my phone and has my boyfriends number, best friends number, family’s number and he texts them all day about me and everything i do.. right now i’m having trouble with auditory hallucinations that my family know about, but i’m fixing. my cousin also always talks about raising me and always being a big brother to me... when i’ve seen him 2 times since i was 10 years old...we have another roommate. my best friend of 7 years. he was in the room and it was 2am. we’d been talking to my cousin literally all day, because we never get a second alone together. my cousin had been drinking all night and refused to go to bed because he wanted to be there when my boyfriend got home so he could “chat” with him about me. but he was so drunk he kept forgetting my boyfriend wasn’t coming over. finally i asked him if my best friend and i could have some time to talk alone. and he flipped. he began screaming at us that we hate him. why can’t he hear what i was going to talk about. we’re just conspiring against him.he ran over to me. held my arms against my chest so hard that my ribs have bruises, got literally so close to my face he was touching me... and screamed over and over about how he could hurt me so badly and that i don’t know who i’m talking to. he believes he can read minds and see “auras” and said he knows i’m lying. he’s screaming he’s going to beat the shit out of me. i kept telling him to just do it. and then he grabbed my face so fucking hard. and told me to try him. i then yelled that my dad owns this house. and that i was going to tell my boyfriend. and he got scared and backed off. immediately he began texting me about how much he loves me... i left the house and ran down the street to my dads house sobbing. iv told my mom... my sister.. my dad... everyone believes i was hallucinating.. they said my best friend will say whatever i want him to so his word doesn’t matter.. but he hurt me.. only my boyfriend believes me... i feel so alone.. iv been having flashbacks to my first rape all day.. to my dad beating me as a kid and everyone denying it ever happened.. i’m covered in bruises.. and i wish i was dead.. i just want someone to believe me...
do you ever just sit in bed alone, and realize that no one would notice you missing? everyone cares only after they announce your death.

anyone else just living day by day, remembering nothing, thinking about nothing, enjoying very little, and being incredibly lonely, but almost as if it's sort of your own fault? like you've done this to yourself?
i cannot verbally explain to anyone over a text, or a call, or by any other means how terrible i feel as of this moment. there are too many reasons and too many complicated situations that i would have to explain for anyone to even have the slightest idea of what kind of pain i'm in at this time. maybe i'm being overbearing...its almost as if my chest is hurting? i forget everything? i have no drive? i'm going to grow up to be that old man who tells those kids to chase their dreams or end up like me. just kill me. 
i think my heart might explode or just stop working from excessive self inflicted heartbreak
i just....ruin everything. i don’t know how to function. it feels like all of the air in my body is rushing towards my heart and pressing on it and it’s going to burst at any moment and my chest hurts and i want so badly to just dissolve into earth. why! why can’t the world just open and swallow me whole! i’m the type of person who invades your life and leaves nothing but destruction. i can’t make this work. i think i deserve to feel this pain sometimes, i just wish i could take pain i cause other people away from them and carry that. i hate myself.
bye
i’ve been diagnosed with persistent depression. i’m going to overdose on anti depressants, pain killers, and slit my wrists. a few months ago my parents sent me to the mental health center, but instead of comfort they were frustrated and pissed at me for being depressed. i have anxiety that never goes away. i’m spending my last day watching marvel movies and sleeping. i’m not going to write a note. probably leave the house around three am and do it by a bridge. i feel at peace thinking about it. the only thing i’m worried about is going to hell. i’m a christian and i don’t want to burn. i want to see god, but i also don’t want to be alive. tonight i’m going to die. thank you
i’m ending it in a few hours
i can’t do this anymore. for some background, almost my whole family has extreme paranoia about vomiting. i’ve always had it, but it’s gotten significantly worse in the past year because i had a stomach ulcer/ got diagnosed with chronic gerd. anyways, almost my entire family has the stomach bug (1 person threw up) and i’m at a point where i feel like the universe is just telling me to kill myself. i’ve been waiting for a reason to actually try. i’ve been avoiding it because i’m genuinely scared even though it’s the only thing i want in life right now. i’m finally going to do it though.i’m most likely going to say i’m going out for a walk then jump into the tracks at the station near my house. it’s the only reliable way i have access to because the only other things i can do is take pills (which rarely works) try and cut (almost never works) and hang myself (usuallg doesn’t work/ i could throw up from it) if anyone has any suggestions on easier ways please let me know. i’m going to do it today. goodbye guysedit: am still here. gonna try and get through this one day at a time, thanks to all of you who were supportive  much love
my dad killed himself
he went missing two months ago and we had no idea where he was for that whole time, and then a week ago someone found his body. he'd committed suicide the night he left. he'd been dead the whole fucking time, two months, and nobody knew. i'm not thinking of killing myself, but i don't know what to do. i've been crying for an hour and i feel like i'm going to throw up, just thinking about how dad's not gonna be at my graduation, not gonna see me score my first goal in hockey, not gonna play guitar with me anymore, not gonna do any of that. i don't know what to do. i'm so lost. 
she’s gone and so will i soon
she left today for the army, she’ll be gone a long time for training and then she’ll be gone another 2 years on top of that for her actual job. we had known each other for coming up on to two years and she was the only thing keeping me sane. those late nights when i was on the verge of suicide she would call me and calm me down until i would fall asleep on the phone with her. whenever i was feeling extra down she always knew what to say to make me smile. i would’ve been dead a long time ago without her and now that she’s gone i know i won’t make it more than a week. she was the only thing keeping me here and now that she’s gone i know this depression and anxiety are going to get the best of me. i just want to apologize to her for not being strong enough to make it through.
i'm attracted to children, and now i've lost all will to live.
ever since i was around 14 i've been attracted to young children. i have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. all throughout my teenage years, i lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and i was so disgusted by myself. i was afraid of how others would react so i never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when i became an adult. when i reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and i entered a terrible period of my life when i was so depressed and yet i couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. when i looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. this stigma scared me a lot. after a year or so living in the dumps, i was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. i grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot i am, i thought that it would be alright to tell him since i thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. i explained my point of view and made it clear that i didn't act on any of my desires. still, he immediately told my brother and i was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.i then fell into even greater depression. i'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, i thought of things such as if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, i might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens. i still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online i managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. i got a job, i made some friends and while i'm not rich, i could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. i was still attracted to children and i was still deathly scared and ashamed, but i internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.i made one particularly good friend from work and i got along well with his family. after knowing him for a few years, i started to think that at least one person i know in real life would understand if i confided to them my darkest secret. it turned out that i'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. a week ago, we were having a few drinks, and i blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. i was still wary enough to stress that i had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and i thought that that would be okay. the thing is, i had met his nieces before when i was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. he stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that i had tricked him all this time, that i was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. he's presumably told my workplace, and i'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. i've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. i've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. nobody understands me at all. the worst thing is, i can't even be angry. it isn't even unreasonable. i pose a tremendous threat to society. i understand that, which is why i fucking hate myself even more for this. at 29, i've lost all connections to anyone i thought cared for me, and now i've lost my will to live. i'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. nobody will even care, so i won't bother writing a proper note.thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this. it just feels kind of refreshing to put my experiences on record like this one last time.
ever wonder how so many people haven’t killed themselves?
it boggles my mind that there are so many people that exist on earth and just,,, live. they rlly be out here alive. like if they feel how i feel , how the fuck haven’t they killed themselves yet? am i just weak? am i weak for thinking about suicide? all the time? i just can’t fathom the idea that people can live life and see a reason to go on every day. i google searched “why don’t people kill themselves” and the only hits i got were links related to “why do people kill themselves?”  but that answer is so fucking obvious to me. i need to know why they dont kill themselves.
a year ago, i promised myself i'd kill myself on the day i graduated college.
it was supposed to be april 28, 2019. graduation is supposed to be an exciting beginning to the rest of your life, but i don't want anything to do with my future.i'm not graduating on time anymore, now. i fucked up my last semester thanks to my depression, and i have to withdraw from my classes. but i'm still thinking about killing myself on april 28.it would be perfect. ending it all while my classmates are at their commencement ceremony celebrating their achievements. i know i would never amount to anything, regardless of whether or not i make it to my graduation. my depression and anxiety have held me back for my entire life. i've fought and fought but always come up short. it's not worth fighting anymore.i want to spend the last month of my life doing things i love, or at least the things i used to love before depression grabbed me by the throat and choked the life out of me. i want to finish my album i've been working on for 6 years so i have something to leave behind. i want to spend quality time with my family and friends so they have lots of good memories to look back on once they recover from the initial shock of my death. i want to eat good food, play video games, and snuggle with my dog.i'm glad i made this decision now. it's given me a contentedness with living that i haven't had for a while. maybe i'll actually be able to enjoy my last month instead of wallowing in self-hatred and fear of the future.i wasn't meant to live past 22.
i don't want to live.
i'm just tired of life. i don't enjoy life and i have no prospects of enjoying life. i'm not in crisis, i just want to stop being alive because i don't like being alive. i feel about life the way someone might feel about a game of monopoly; i just don't want to play anymore. i'm not sure what that makes me.
the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that i have no way to do it
ive decided that i probably will just end all this bullshit, but im not because i have no way of doing it. whatever i choose to do i dont want to leave whoever will find me with a gruesome scene. i want it to be quick, painless, and private. the only thing i can remotely think of is a gunshot to the head out in the forest or something.but i suppose fortunately, i have no access to guns, lethal medications, or bridges in my city. i dont want to die in my house and i dont want to be found. i guess in time ill be so fed up with myself ill just want to get it over with no matter how. im at the point where im trying to form a plan and i know i should get help but i dont want it. because even if i did, id still be living the same life and id still be the same person, which is the entire problem. i have no hope anymore. im never going to be interesting, or beautiful. im never going to be loved by anyone, my parents are never going to be proud of me. some people just arent born to be happy and the fact i was born at all was a mistake. i really can't go on
til nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously, even your doctors and therapists.
everybody thinks you're just being immature or finding excuses for your failures. the only time they realise that you're really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it's all too late.you might think the professionals would act totally different. but the truth is that the therapist i met literally told me to grow up and be responsible, and that the doctor i saw more or less implied he couldn't help and wouldn't care as long as it's my life not his child's.i'm trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days. don't want to live through a life i'm incapable of living through while nobody cares at all.
it’s so sad seeing how many people want to die
it’s so sad seeing so many people post “well today is the day” and “goodbye, i’m doing it tonight” like so many people struggle with this thoughts and its something that happens per minute. if this sub only has 120k and so many peoples lives are so problematic that they’d rather just disappear from the world makes me wonder how many people attempt or kill  themselves daily worldwide...i don’t think the average persons aware of how many people struggle with this issue. most people who have suicidal thoughts keep it a secret it’s weird and tragic knowing that person sitting next to you is probably the last time you’ll see them again...ps: i’m also thankful for this sub like were all in our own little world together where we share our deepest secrets and that there’s people who can actually understand what i’m going through. feels nice.
i don’t want to kill myself. i want to delete my save file and start over.
dying seems pointless. it feels like demoing a building because the pipes are bad. but god, if i thought it would send me back, russian-doll style, i’d do it in a heartbeat.i want to be 13-14 again, and be as loud and persistent as possible about the fact that i was suicidally depressed, even then, and about the abuse i and my family suffered at home.i want to smack that first beer i chugged at that party out of my hand. i missed the little note at the bottom of the screen saying “this will affect your destiny”. i want to have never started down this path that’s taken so much.i want to tell the “friends” i had growing up that i am not their whipping boy, then find people who would actually make me feel good about myself.i want to demand therapy and medication, and take it seriously from the start.i want to actually have the wherewithal and energy to take college apps seriously, and end up somewhere i wanted to be, not within spitting distance of my family.most of all, i want to avoid isolating myself for so goddamn long. i want to avoid becoming a 25 year old who has tons of “friends” but can’t remember the last time he touched a human being.i realize my mistakes now. i could undo them if i could only have the chance.
help
im standing over my bathroom sink with a knife in my hand, crying and trying to hold on.  ive dealt with depression since i was a young teenager, so its almost been half my life at this point.  its ruined everything good that has happened to me in my life.. my friendships, athletics, interests, and my relationship with the love of my life. no one should have to live like this. ive never been one to show emotion, but ive cried my eyes out every single night for the past two weeks because things just keep getting worse. i don't see a way forward or a reason to keep fighting.  i need help... please.
i wish there was a 'stop existing' button
i was gonna cut down to an artery this easter but my dumbass thought that it would be a good idea to make a bunch of obvious noticeable self harm cuts on my hand and of course my parents found out and they somehow managed to find my suicide note in my geography copy and they never talked to me about it but my mom showed it to my new therapist when i wasn't in the room. don't you ever wish you could just disappear without leaving any pain behind like you were never born because god i sure do/// or maybe i'm just being a dramatic attention seeking teenager i don't even know anymore
i'm gonna end it all
everything is getting worse and worse. my parents value material things more than me and i was almost going to get beaten up today by them. at school everyone is against me and some make the experience a nightmare. i will just run away tomorrow, find a nice tree to hang myself and end it all. the only friend i have doesn't give a shit, he only wished me good luck when i told him i wanna run away. i'm gonna make everyone happy tomorrow.
does anyone else feel worthless?
i feel completely useless. i don't think i do anything for anybody. i serve absolutely nothing and have no purpose. does anyone else feel the same way?
i want to reach out to someone, anyone but i feel so detached.
i’m hurting so much and i can’t do it anymore. i know i’ve posted before and i’m sorry if i’m vague. i don’t even have words to get the emotions out. i am only 21 but it’s so clear to me now that i ruin everything in my life. i know people love me, but i know i’m not a good person. i know i feel this way because of my own actions and i know i can’t ever fix or make up for things i have done. i don’t see the point in my life anymore. i don’t want to do anything. nothing makes me feel better. i just want it to stop and i always end up hurting myself again. i know i need to seek help, but i just don’t see a point anymore. i haven’t slept in 2 days and i think i’m done being scared. i’m just done, i hope god is real. i hope he forgives me. i just want everything to stop. i want to say please help me but it doesn’t matter anyways. i’m sorry.edit: you’re all such amazing people, i’ve cried so much reading these comments. complete strangers who care more than people right next to me is crazy to me. i am still depressed, i am still hurting but i am still here. thank you so much. i love you all even tho we don’t know each other. i wish i had better words.
sometimes i wish my mom hated me so i wouldn’t feel bad about wanting to kill myself
she’s the only reason i haven’t 
just got told to kill myself
i guess that’s it.           i didn’t expect this to blow up like it did thank you to everyone that left kind messages you dont know how much they mean to me
fuck you, 2019
my life fell apart this year. i will turn 30 next year with nothing. i hope i can end it before may. i really don't want to have to keep doing this.
i want to be dead but i'm too much of a fucking coward to follow through
i'm afraid that i would hurt people by doing it but i already hurt people just fine while i'm alive so would it really be that different stuck in a loop. same shit over and over again. meet people. people like you. people get to know you. people leave. repeat repeat repeat. don't bother falling in love cuz that's never fucking happening. you're a 30 year old virgin. you are not desirable. to think otherwise is foolish. you will be alone for the rest of your time here. however long that is. i'm the common denominator. i'm the problem. always have been. only one solution. the loneliness i feel right now is the comeuppance for how shitty of a person i've been. for all the people i've hurt. pushed away. betrayed. there's nothing left for me here. it's my fault.
do you ever get sudden compulsive urges to kill yourself?
for me personally i’m not suicidal all the time, but in small bouts.

crazy stuff 
literally dying inside
my partner of 16 years, and wife of 6 months, came home from a trip to ireland to ask for a divorce. completely out of the blue. turns out she met someone over there that she fell in love with (that cut her off, yay) and made her realize she needs to find herself without me (forever).then the other day, after two beers, i failed a check stop and got a dui. licensed suspended for at least 90 days.i am literally gutted inside and think about suicide literally every minute of the day. i'm abusing alcohol and cannabis just to get through the day.how do you even think about the future when you're entire life has been destroyed?(i already see a psychologist and psychiatrist for bipolar 2)edit: i'm honestly blown away by the number of supportive comments, and zero negative comments, received from this group. to answer a bunch of questions: yes i am trying to quit alcohol, although this weekend wasn't great, i'm using cannabis for now, i got a prescription for ativan to get rid of the panic attacks, i was going to the gym daily until i lost my transportation, and i'm struggling to get outside even to walk the dogs. today's my appointment with my lawyer regarding the dui... thank you all again.
i've been reading this sub for the pass 4 hours, and think i don't want to kill myself anymore.
i might be a waste of space and money to everyone i lovebut i feel , i don't want to kill myself about it. i think tomorrow, i will try to work on it, and hopefully,become something worth loving again : )edited: i really appreciate your kind comments, but today was another awful day.a lot of you asked me  to talk about it, so here is more background i have to admit, i don't have the courage to kill myself, but i am still hating every minute my life nowmy problem is simple. i am sick , not my body , but my mind. i can't fix it, my psychiatrist can't fix it, my psychologist can't fix it. meds can't fix it neither.i don't know what to do, i feel like i am impresioned in my own body. this is slowly killing everything nice i had in my life. i know you will say, *it's only your mind you can fix it!*. but i am being in this for 10 painful years and there is little to no improvement. just pain, day after dayevery day , i have to look to ones i love and feel the disappointment. the rage, the sadness of my condition. today, the same happened , the same way it happened day after day for a decade.i don't know what to do. i would give everything to be okey again. there would be no price i would not pay, but i feel there is no real solution to my condition than an slow and solitary death
i really fucking wish i had access to a gun

do you ever want to die because you're just so bored of life?
my life isn't really bad, everything in is just pointless and boring. i just do the same shit every day, all while mildly resenting my existence and life. i won't ever be successful or important enough to be able to justify my own existence to myself.
anyone else hate waking up
waking up and realising i'm still alive is one of the worst fucking feelings in the world. it just fills me with dread that i have to find a way to exist for the next 16 hours without hating every second of it
i've come to accept this
i've accepted that i will do nothing with my life. die alone and miserable.i've come to accept my death and i embrace it with open arms. each day drawing it closer, is a day where i am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away. it sounds cliché but it really feels like it.i've accepted that life is a flood, washing over me like waves crashing into rock, slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust. it feel like i have no control in life. that i am just a person looking into another miserable persons life, who is getting worse day by day, slowly succumbing to the poison known as living.i know that this sounds very cliché, but this is the best way of describing it. grades are going down, i'm not loving what i do, i don't feel motivated to do anything anymore, feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife, but no sharpening it, its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse, no love, no happiness. hope for a better tomorrow is just fiction at this point. i try seeking help. i go to a psychologist and i try to get better myself.im thinking of just writing a suicide note for my parents, been writing a diery of all my thoughts, not well written but it gets some of the thoughts out.but i've reached a serious low point in my life. a point where i'm looking for other people's advice. an outside perspective if you would.sorry if there are some mistakes in my english. not my first language after all.
considering killing myself this night
life sucks anyway; i'll never be able to make it out of boring and mundane modern life.i'm jsut nobody.
i admitted that i was suicidal to my boss, and his response resulted in cutting myself.
i, a 23 year old female, am a teacher, rejected multiple times, but now teach yet again. worded that pretty stupidly but... anyways.i was reported by some of my co-workers that i have been doing my job poorly. in what way, i don't know. maybe the pauses in between sentences, dragging out words, or arriving to the classroom 15 minutes late. i went to the principal's office and asked what exactly is preventing my potential. told him instantly about my depression, due to some advice given to me in this website. he said that i'm faking it for an excuse to slack, or that i'm looking for attention. i just abruptly left.it reminded me of how cruel and heartless people can be, and how worthless i am in the grand scheme of things. one thing lead to another and... read title.this abyss keeps getting deeper and deeper.
i am being checked into the psych ward.
i am going to the er to tell them how i feel. i am going to take care of myself. i need some assurance that i'm doing the right thing for myself. positive reinforcement, y'know.update; mom won't take me. not serious enough???update 2: i am going to see my therapist tonight. they are required to send me, yes?update 3: i am being checked in tonight. i will update with a separate post once i am out.
i hate suicide hotlines because you use every ounce of energy and will left within you to explain things, only to be given some bullshit advice. like “look out the window and drink tea!” srs that happened once.

no hope, no strenght, no future.
i've spent 2 and a half years institutionalised, going in and out of different facilities. been diagnosed with szpd, paranoid schizophrenia, depression and social anxiety. before that i've spent 2 years untreated, including a year in total social isolation. was told by a psychotherapist that i was gonna spend the rest of my life in mental health care.i've since got out and found a job i've always dreamed of having. i am trying to improve and integrate into society, but the effort seems fruitless. i feel like i am constantly lying to people by acting as if everything's alright, by smiling and pretending to be happy. even my therapist couldn't tell the state i am actually in. needless to say, even though i told him about it, he didn't help much.i am taking antipsychotics and antidepressants, following any advice given in therapy. it's just not helping me against this.i've tried looking for a suicide hotline, but there are no active ones in my country. so i've decided to post here and it's the first time i am opening about this to strangers. please, don't tell me to discuss this with my family. the last time i've told them about it - they commited me to yet another mental hospital.i don't believe in any possibility of this situation getting better, my energy is running out and each new day is a dreadful possibility. it won't take me much more to step over the edge, into death this time.
(serious) went to my doctor for help about suicide
for depression and ->anxiety<-he called the police despite that i stayed calm all the time. police rushed me and pushed me on the floor, i was so stressed out i couldnt move, and was like a stick (unvoluntary). they said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm. they finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked... it took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)they brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore. i was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. nothing about why i was brought here. so i freaked out often and they shoot me. after this all went smooth. i like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)they tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) i took the ambulance and once i was there... i dont remember anything at all, nothing, niet, nada.i have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... and i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.p.s. i dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. and also i have zero violences back ground.with all this story my question is: now where do i go to find help? everything on the internet say to go see your doctor, but now i can barely get out of my house. it was already very hard but now its unbearable. i have constant suicide thought for over 20years now but also have full custody of my 12years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world. (she's in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her)p.s.2. im sorry if its hard to follow or understand, im french from québec and there isnt much french forum to get help.
there is so much pain in the world
and i don’t know, i just wish there was more that i could do to stop it. i feel so responsible for all of the bad things people have done to me, because they have been through something bad themselves. september is just such a horrible month. there are so many horrible anniversaries, and so many tragedies. i know three people now who died in this month. my friend recently became homeless. i’m struggling with my studies. my sister told me about her abuse. it’s almost been one year since i tried killing myself and i’m still here, crying about everything and never really reaching out. i never do anything right. i just wish i could undo death, or do something to make things better for people. i wish i could die knowing it would impact nobody. i’m so alone. nobody really seems to care. i really wish every action didn’t have an impact.i don’t know, i think this is a cry for help? i feel like i’m going to do something stupid and maybe at this point it’s not even stupid. i’m so sorry that i feel this way, partially because i’m sorry that i’m not living my teenage years happy, but mostly because i know i’m probably gonna end up killing myself even when i know it’s gonna hurt people.
i no longer want to die.
the past few months have been difficult but i think i’ve finally come out of this depression. the day i was going to end it all, my boyfriend come over and took me for a long walk. i finally realized i have something to fight for. i know there will still be hard times in the future but right now i’m living in the present. thank you to everyone in this subreddit for helping me. keep fighting.edit: wow, i didn't expect this to get so much attention. i'm glad to help. <3
no, i won't be turning 20 in 2020. i already have pills to end it.
edit: thanks for the downvotes. that's all i needed to know about how much anyone cares.
am i the only one who finds thinking of suicide comforting?
the fact that i can always kill myself is really comforting to me, it gives me a feeling of control of my life, that in the end i can decide my fate, and no one can do anything about it. it's weird, some days this is the only thing that keeps me going.
i rather kill myself then working my entire life for greedy ceos and corrupt politicians
you need money to live. you need to work for money. well.. i don't want to work the rest of my life, even with the occasional vacation because i'd still have to return to the job. similar to how no matter how happy/better i temporarily feel(rarely) but return to depression once my mind takes over. i can't do this for the rest of my life, nor do i want to.. so i'm thinking about it..so please god why won’t you just take my life and end the suffering here and now!! 
i started researching how to kill myself
i haven't done that in a looong ass time. that's how i know i'm back at rock bottom.it's the only thing i can focus on. probably cause it's the only thing i care about now. everything else is just fucking brain fog.
self hatred
every little thing i do wrong makes me hate myself so much more. i’ve done so much wrong i honestly feel like i’m past the point of no return. i really wish my body could just give up and die on command. my life feels like it is so far beyond repair. i just wish i was never born at this point nothing in life has been worth this. i will never be happy, and i don’t know what to do with that information. i want to die but i can’t do anything about it.i wish i could just do something. i never do anything to try to fix my problems i just make more. i sometimes try to fix something but when it feels like i’m making progress i always take 10 steps backwards in the wrong direction.i will never get better, i can only move downhill. i could keep typing forever about how much i hate myself but there is no point. i will never do anything about it. i am just a bystander watching as my life wastes away. i guess i should just hope it goes by quickly
if i kill myself my mom will be absolutely devastated.
that's really the only thing keeping me here. i woke up depressed (as usual) and found a package with my name on it. my mom had got me a pair of earrings for valentine's day along with a card telling me how much i mean to her. instead of making me happy, it made me really sad. i don't deserve this. 
isn’t it kinda bullshit that you can’t confide in anyone that you want to kill yourself without being committed?
if you’re in such a bad place that you’re thinking of killing yourself but not at the point to where you’re in immediate danger of doing it, shouldn’t you be able to admit this, without being held against your will at a psychiatric facility that your insurance probably won’t cover, work won’t be happy about your absence at, where you’ll be given meds against your will and not allowed to leave?what if i could admit this to a psychiatrist/therapist so that we can have a discussion about the most appropriate med + therapy combo to get me on the right track?because the idea of just trusting random mood stabilizing drugs being forced upon me as i’m whisked away from work and my daily life and not allowed to live my life or leave for 3 or more days *wouldn’t exactly inspire me to ask for help in the future*.what if i could just be candid about how i feel so that i can get treated? can’t imagine that i’m the only one who feels this way. makes me feel horribly alone. how can i best be treated if i’m withholding this from my healthcare providers, when i’m not in immediate danger? surely i’m not the only one who struggles, with this concept?
when ever something bad happens my head always goes to kill your self

threw all of my bullets in the river this morning.
i'm not gonna lose. this isn't gonna beat me. last time i felt like this, i threw my firing pin into my back yard. once i felt better, i found it, cleaned it, and put it back. but at this point, i don't think i can ever have a gun again. got rid of the bullets first, since without them, it's useless. i think i'm just gonna drop it off at the police station and tell them i don't want it anymore.  it's just so hard to fight. i don't want to be alive. i want to die. things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. i found out my ex, who i still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. she died cold and lonely, with nothing. in the street in front a a fucking salvation army soup kitchen. she stole clothes to stay warm. and some asshole decided she needed to die for that. i found out that i have cancer. even best case scenario, i am in for a ton of pain and misery. and that's if i even make it. i really hope i don't. and then, to top it all off: i got the girl of my dreams pregnant. the baby is gone. and she won't talk to me, at all. i'm not even sure what happened. did she abort it? did she miscarry? was she trying to keep it? i can't get over the fact that i may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. like, we knew she might be pregnant. and she seemed to not hate me. but then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. how can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? i kinda wish i still had those bullets. and that's why i needed to throw them out. even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. i have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and i'm just trying to hold out until then. 
i will not kill myself before i haven't tried everything
i have made this decisions when i thought about suicide a lot last winter. i was ashamed of myself because i think that i gave up way to early. i am fighting against mental and physical health problems and i will not give up until i tried everything to improve my situation.i hope you guys do this to it's really good to look at things that way.edit: thanks for the silver u/drhitshot i hope you are doing well!
it’s really sad how lonely being suicidal is
like, you can’t talk to anyone. and if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. you know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. you don’t want them to overreact. you don’t want them to worry. you can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. no one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. you don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. and the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. you can’t rely on just that person. it takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. and then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. wondering what’s the best thing to do. and then there’s the planning. what to write in your note saying goodbye. what to do with your dog. how to leave your apartment. what date to set. i just wish euthanasia was legal so i could die with my friends and family by my side. i wish i could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. i wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. but no, i have to do this alone. and it’s so lonely. i’m not afraid of dying. i’m slowly learning to not be afraid if i fail trying to die, and die suffering slowly and painfully. i just wish i wasn’t lonely through it all. i wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before i go.  
a few months ago i set a deadline. that deadline, march 12 has arrived.
when i last [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/5mmg7z/i_set_a_deadline/), life seemed completely miserable with no possibility of it getting any better. i continued living day to day, mostly miserable and feeling absolutely lifeless inside. i continued my daily activities with that fake smile so no one would suspect my plan to jump off that bridge with a rope around my neck. then an unanticipated trip abroad to an exotic land halfway around the world popped up. then came an out of the blue reconnecting with an old friend. then came a tiny puppy into my life. things aren't completely terrible at the moment. to quote hyperbole and a half, maybe everything isn't hopeless bullshit. for the moment, i want to live.
should i get a pet so i have something to look forward to coming home to
i don’t like living with my housemates and i’m really depressed. i feel like a want something i can love that isn’t a human i need to put so much effort into. maybe like a fish or some shit just so i can have some sort of company?
my only motivation to live is my dog.
these days i feel like i am tired of everything - work, friends, family, life itself. i'm only hanging on for my dog [3 y/o], because i've learned that dogs don't understand the concept of death. i'm not depressed, i'm just tired of everything (unless they're the same?) there are days when i feel like i can really pass away already, but there are still days when i want to live. i just don't know how to or why else should i continue anymore. i can only hope my dog would live a healthy happy long life, and i want to make sure i'm by his side.
psa from the suicidewatch mod team: we're getting a lot of complaints about generic uplifting or i love you type posts and comments. please read and follow guideline 4c in the sidebar.
we realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help, and, if they haven't read the guidelines, it probably hasn't occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do. but a) it's likely to backfire and b) there's no excuse for not reading the rules!responding to a suicidal person with messages like this (excerpted from a recent responder who we'll keep anonymous because they probably meant well):>  you are not a failure. you are smart, you are young, you have an entire life to live. it is not impossible to become that person you want to be. you can be great.is incredibly invalidating. if the person you're talking to were capable of believing that, they probably wouldn't be at serious risk for suicide.  and inflicting anything on them along the lines of you can do anything you want or life is worth living, just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  as feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called empowering messages kill people***.  guideline 4c links to [a previous psa post](http://redd.it/1cep2h) that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of cheering-up is absolutely against the rules here.  if you have any questions, please [shoot us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23suicidewatch).  app users, remember you can get to our sidebar here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/about/sidebarour concerns aside, we are incredibly grateful to everyone who steps up and helps support our vulnerable ops.  there's lots of stuff in the sidebar, especially [the talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) that we've put together to help you be more effective, and avoid dangerous intervention strategies.**edit:**  one other very dangerous type of message is it gets better.  because of the prominence of the trevor project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that it gets better is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  nothing could be more wrong.  it gets better comes out of an initiative to reach lgbt youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  and the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  it's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  but as a hopeful message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  first, it makes promises on behalf of the universe - and the universe may not keep them.  second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.  
can someone just fucking care? i always take on the burden of others to help them out. maybe sometimes i want to be that little boy again and just fucking cry. everyday i wake up i’m tired and not the tired where you just feel like you needed more sleep, it’s the tired of life. i’m on my last stand

why do both of my parents think everything i do is wrong?
i’m 17 years old and these past few years i occasionally keep fighting with my parents with reasons i don’t even know.the reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs, my grades are dropping, getting into fights, or anything that could get me into trouble.it’s mostly of simple reason such as :when we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he/she is cleaning our room. so my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. so i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. then my parents asked what did i say to them. i answered “i just asked them to bring us some coffee”. then they told me “why did you say that? you should’ve said can you give us coffee since you didn’t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room, and now we will have to pay for the coffee.” i said it’s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn’t have it before. they asked me to call the staff again to which i say there’s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debatejust because of coffee......and it’s been like this these past few years i mean i get it parents have ego and they want to have some sort of dominance over their kids but isn’t this to much? since then i started to just take the blame to which i thought they would stop yelling to me.they didn’t just moments ago before writing this post i got into this type of debate again with my parents. but, this time i feel this would be the last...i couldn’t take it anymore i just want to end this all i have no one to talk to and my parents who’s supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this is the one who’s causing the problem.they keep telling me i’m wrong and after things cool down when i asked what did i do wrong they always answer with you’re not wrong and begin their an hour long speech about life.i get no one wants to read this and no one cares about a problem of someone they don’t know. i don’t even know how to kill myself or do i even have the guts to do it. all i want is for this problem to stop and look for a place to vent so thank you if you’re reading this.
i don’t even know how to say this but i feel like this is a good place to get all of it off of my chest, if i even can or honestly even finish this post. i know i’m suicidal but i don’t know if i will do it
basically, the depression began in 2014 when my dad killed himself.no one in my family saw it coming. he never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. i remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.for two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and i thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. i believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but i’ll get to that. my mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. we were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.now later on, we found out about what happened. i think there’s still stuff about his or my mom’s life i don’t know. stuff about that day. but here it is:the day before, i remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey. i think i said bye but i don’t really know. that was the last time i ever saw my dad alive.the next day, i’m waking up for school and i find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while, talking to police. my dad was missing and there had been a car crash.at school, i confided in one of my teachers about the situation and i was worried at all times.i get home and play video games with my brother. my dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital. a little later, my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us. a cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital. we arrive, discover the death of my father and my grandma’s son, and i’m freaking out.for a bit, i thought i had heard that he was just in really bad shape. about 10 or something minutes after “finding out he’s in bad shape” i discover that instead, he is dead. i went blank with crying. i was horrified. i was whispering to myself “no” constantly and i was rocking back and forth.rocking back and forth when i’m nervous, scared, tired, sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day.i ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying, along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so i was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye.i go home after a while along with my family. my brother was at the hospital and my sister was not. at this point, she had no clue that her dad had died. she was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back. she was 4 hours away. that’s a long trip. she was freaking out because a friend of hers, who heard what happened, sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead. she was picked up and was so freaked out and worried.i fell asleep and at 1am when i woke up, i go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out.my sister, who i barely see show emotion or cry. someone who’s older and i looked up to. and she was destroyed by this. i went up to her and hugged her.my siblings are never affectionate. we hate each other or at least that’s what we tell each other. my brother and i’s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying “you’re a bitch”.so hugging my sister, something i don’t remember ever doing before that or much after, was a big deal.this ripped my family apart.here’s how that day went for my father:he was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car. he got out and left the scene. he walked through the fields so goddamn close to my house, and eventually went and bought paper, a pen, a knife, probably some other shit and went to a hotel. he checked in and i don’t know how long he was in that room but what i do know, is he wrote out his letters. there were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped. the police found out about the crash and where he was by now. they were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists.i have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain. but the truth is, he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash. to make it seem like an accident. and he failed. but he couldn’t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened. my dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough. he never tried getting help and he left his family.i hate my dad for what he did. but of course i also miss him. this whole post has already taken so long to write because i had to take breaks so i can have mental breakdowns.i was originally going to explain why i’m depressed but after writing all of this out, instead i’m going to say you know what, i’m not even going to continue. i am suicidal but i won’t do it any time soon so i can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but i’m going to use this post to say that...do not kill yourselfplease don’t.don’t do it.my dad killed himself and it destroyed my family.i didn’t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe i’m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done, but people already knew about that.my life sucks because of my dad.he’s the reason i want to kill myself and he didn’t even try to get help.i hate him. i love him but god do i hate him.my mom has her own hand in my depression which if i ever do another post, i’ll get to, but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last 5 years.pleasedontkillyourselfseekhelpyoumatter
does anyone else's parents have no empathy when you're suicidal?
i start considering suicide every now and then, and my mom is horrible at responding to it. i've been called selfish a number of times, been told that i will be harming those i love, as well as such fun quotes as you'll be solidifying your status as a failure, only the lowest of the low commit suicide and i will hate you if you kill yourself.at some point she will pull the i'm not going to talk to you about this anymore because i don't want to reinforce this behavior line. this is usually followed by me getting mad and exploding at her, at which point she'll just ignore me outright for the better part of the day. if dad's home, they will loudly discuss how horrible i am while i'm in the other room.oh, and apparently i'm harming her just by talking about it.mom, you're not making me not want to kill myself. in fact, if that's what you really think, then i might just commit suicide just to spite you. i love you when you're not berating me for occasionally having suicidal thoughts (and/or other bullshit you pull), but when you are, fuck you!i just wanted to rant. does anyone else experience this from those they were supposed to trust the most, their parents/family?
this is just absurd like wtf

it’s not like breaking a bone. if i tell people what’s going on, i get a “yeah i feel that” or “mood” ffs dude i want to stop breathing.
i'm going to enlist
i've been suicidal for a while now but i never had the courage to go through with it.. so i'm going to enlist in the military instead... atleast i won't die in vain with everyone thinking that i'm a loser
i'm never calling a hotline again
yesterday was the second time they called the cops on me. i begged them not to, i refused to give away my location. they still found me, shoved me in their van and took me to the hospital. at the hospital i waited 5 hours for someone to talk to me before they got a mental health professional then, who i had to regurgitate my entire life story to before being promptly dismissed. i would have rather just died than go through all of that. 
why are people saying that anyone under 18 can't be depressed?
i've seen people say that, and that once you're 18 shit only gets worse, so anyone under 18 shouldn't complain. are we really just that annoying?
this sub really helped me, just wanted to say thank you.
i'm using a new account, but previously with my old account i posted here quite a lot. one of my friends discovered my old reddit account and all the posts i made here, and we had a pretty lengthy conversation about it.this sub has some of the most genuinely helpful people, and i really wanted to say thank you to everyone who reached out and helped me on my old account. &#x200b;stay safe everyone.
i just feel trapped
sorry if this feels all over the place, i'm just adding as i remember.also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.i grew up in a somewhat dysfunction asian family.- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as i have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being larger than the other, i would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. eventually after moving to a different school ( i went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) i made some friends and it was enjoyable. my met my best mate ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. my group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when ryan would start to drift away. he had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. i still course myself for not reaching out as i thought he was doing ok, i started attending university this is when i learned he killed himself.- my father was an alcoholic and being asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. there was a time when my mother, sister and i stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.- my brother died when i was in grade 3 from some medical illness which i still have no idea what it was as i was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and i don't want to bring any of that back. some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice i suppose. there was a day where i wrote about how my brother recently passed and how i would be attending his funeral very soon. my teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. this soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. her teacher asked her about the funeral and i don't know what she said in response. later at home, she told my parents about how i told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew they berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. perhaps this is where i started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as i would just get shit on for sharing.- my mother and father divorced while i was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when i see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for letting him into the house. she would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. there are memories of when i was young, i would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and i would come downstairs to see her she would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.- my mother soon started dating again and i remember that she was dating 2 guys at once i think. some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. she asked me which one i liked better and not to tell the guy a about the existence of guy b. i didn't know what was really going on as i was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years i realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. i'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.- my parents work in a factory and immigrated over from china so this was huge. i'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. my father gave me money for university fees but i spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as i was about 18 at the time, and it's not like i grew up learning how to manage my finances, i was and still am young and stupid. i started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. i told my parents who i was living with that i needed a break. if i had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which i am but..... i wouldn't have been able to take it. they accepted my lie and so i found a job and worked. eventually i went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work i'm still missing but with the lies i've told them, it makes sense why they would think i would graduate. my situation is entirely my fault and i don't know what to fucking do. to top it all off, i play far too many video games as it's my escape. recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, i was still playing video games as an escape. she could hear me playing and told me to get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit. i do, i just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. she told my mother and she similarly thinks i'm a human bag of garbage at this point. and i honestly don't blame them. my sister told me once that i am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. i agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. a bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and i'm happy for them. i just see how i'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and i feel absolutely miserable. there's more i can write out but it's already a large wall of text.my university has counselling services i can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........i can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as i don't have co-op. all job listings i've seen for internships list having a gpa of 3.0 minimum and i hovering around a 69% average which is about a gpa of 1.33. i can't get a job without experience and i can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing gpa certainly doesn't help as i can't even stick my foot in the door.i just don't want to be alive anymore. i just want it all to stop. if i kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if i'm not around.
i reach out for once and get fucking denied
i want to kill myself, but in a last ditch i tried the suicide hotline online chat. i was actively participating when the person said they were closing the chat for inactivity. i responded probably less than thirty seconds beforehand. i have to talk to someone online because no one in person believes me, but even that didnt fucking work
i got arrested buying drugs off the darknet that i intended to kill myself with via overdose and now i am facing a felony and 5-8 years in prison. whats the point in continuing on?
i have been depressed for a third of my life (the last 10 years).  i have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  the first time i woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  the second time my parents found me and emt s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  the third time i overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  i don't know if i was unconscious for those 7 days or what but i was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  that was almost a year and a half ago.  every time i survive i try to give life another shot and every year i find myself worse and worse off.  i know i am incredibly lucky but i wish i succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  i feel like i am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.i don't want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  my life had continued to deteriorate and i had gotten to a point where i could barely take care of myself.  i stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  i lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  i asked my parents to take care of my dog because i loved him too much and he deserved better care than what i could offer at the time. its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, i had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  its that i have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like i don't deserve what i have been given.  i am terrified of failing so i take very few chances and unfortunately even when i feel confident enough to take a chance i end up failing which brings me down further.  i feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, i graduated with full ib, honers and a 4.11.  unfortunately when i first went to college i had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.anyways back to earlier this year.  this was going to be my 3rd attempt at finishing my degree and i had failed again.  i have been lonely and single for 3 years, my last girlfriend cheated on me, and this christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so i spent my very first christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state.  things were going downhill and again i was getting more and more depressed.  i started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure i had food to eat.  at this point had lost my job, my friends were sick of hanging out with me because i was too negative.  i felt like i was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life.  i made the decision to order drugs off the darknet, as i had done a few times before and do it right this time.my package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery.  i was arrested and sat in jail for 2 months.  i'm always surprised when i think that life can't get any more unbearable and jail was just that.  after that i was forced into drug treatment for 6 months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision.  my court date is a month away and i am facing a felony and up to 8 years in prison.i have tried everything to get better i have a therapist and a psychiatrist.  i have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin, which doesn't do shit.  i have tried dbt and tms.  i don't understand why i should keep going.  i have completely fucked my life up.  even in the best scenario i will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation.  i'll be barred from a ton of jobs that i was interested in.  i can't even get a job at 711 right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check.  i probably will struggle to get housing in the future.  i can't even imagine having to go to prison much less for 8 fucking years.  i just feel like this is torture, every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day.  my friends and family have abandoned me.  i was evicted when i was in jail and lost most of my stuff, i'm broke.  it just doesn't make sense to keep trying.  i feel like i have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another.  i am so fucking lonely but as much as i would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures.  what is the point?  even if my life weren't a complete shit show i would still feel this way.  i just feel like i am pointlessly torturing myself at this point.  this whole year has been like a nightmare that i can't wake up from.  sometimes i wonder if i actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment.  i forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  i feel like i am just a disappointment and i might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  i have already pretty much decided that if i get prison time then i will do it but i fear i wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  i felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation i feared the most in life.  losing my freedom, my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself.  why should i continue to wait around for that to happen?i
i wish that nobody loved me.
then i wouldn't have to feel guilty for wanting to die.
i find myself crying more in public spontaneously
it's happened before when i was starting to work years ago but at least i could hold it a bit until finding a place to hide and cry, but now it could happen anywhere. i can barely hold myself together enough to not tear when family visits. or in the line on the market, or in a restaurant. yesterday i just started fully crying on the street and obviously people stared at me. it's humiliating. and i can't control it.i'll have to learn to calm myself though. please don't give suggestions, possitive thinking has never worked for me, it actually makes me feel worse.
life is nothing but one big daily task of the same repetitive shit year in and year out i want out this rat race i can't fake it anymore

my dog just passed away
i started considering to end it all a little while ago, when im drunk i have the strongest wish to do itthen, i remember my parents, even if they love me for the sake of social norm, i have those two with me, i couldn’t bare to make them suffer like that, especially my dad, who loves his family the mostcurrently (me, 23, my mom, 57, my dad 59) we had a dog, she was so loved and well treated, she was so smart, dad and i loved her like it was my little sister, my dad relied so much on her emotionallylong story short, she got run over, we got her treated, this morning we found her deadi already had serious depression, family is already struggling to bind itself, ive got no interest at all with nothing or nobody, i already had fear, about loneliness, about my father, and now i fear even more, i fear that he will age more quickly, that he will not fulfill his obligations, we could lose our house, i fear that he will die soon too, if he dies i swear i kill myself in the momenti have already lurked and sadly, posted here i know i will not kill myself now, so if any of you wasted time reading this rn, please go help more critical peoplei just don’t have anyone to tell this, to tell my problems, yo relief what i feel, and just wanted to note this somewhereim just convinced more and more and more to the point im 99% sure that i will have myself killed on some point, i just want to die but also im concerned about my dad and i have plenty of fear
i think the main reason why i don't kill myself is because i don't want my cats to be sad
title sounds like a joke. it's not.me: 41 years old and i've never, not once in my adult life, felt that i belonged anywhere. my childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after i was born. i have no memory of them being together. looking back, i spent a lot of it being passed around. sometimes i'm living with my mother. sometimes with my father. sometimes with my grandparents. meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. they were just keeping me alive. my parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when i was born). my grandparents were giving, but distant. they gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a tv.at some point, around ten years old i developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. i couldn't even say my own name. i remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell i was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. i was seriously thinking that i would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. it was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. today, i'm still a stutterer, but i can work with it. stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. when you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. you get better at choosing your words. you also care less about everyone accepting you. with that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. yet, i still feel like i don't belong anywhere in this world. i never joined the rest of the world. i have no real friends. family connections are tenuous. the family i was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on christmas day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).i thought i would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time i reached my 40s, but i'm not. and i don't know why. maybe i've made my bed here and i don't know how to make it anywhere else.one thing that i can say about myself is that i'm not angry. i don't want to hurt anyone. i don't hate anyone. my situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. my story isn't anything special.i've just always been sad. i don't know how to be anything other than sad. and i hide it. i hate the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so i keep them bottled up. i cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much i like the people i'm around.i've thought about suicide. i've stared at pill bottles. i've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. but i've never done it. never even tried. my feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted every last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. hate your life? change it. quit your job. get a new one. change your habits. talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. start painting. start a blog. learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. if it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.last year, when i was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, i reached out for my idea of a life line:i adopted a cat.a young cat. five months old. a girl with a lot of life left in her. i brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.and i started crying. overcome with emotion. i knew right then that i loved her. and that no matter how sad i am, i need to live so that i can take care of her. a few months later, i thought that she could use another kitty friend so i adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. after a rough first week, they eventually became friends and i now love them both equally. in fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want i shower on these two cats. they get nothing but endless affection from me. i only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). i talk to them and play with them daily. if i somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to paris or somewhere today, i honestly don't think i would want it. as sad it may sound, i'd miss my cats too much. a cat's love is interesting. they place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that i'm happy to fill. it keeps me sane in a weird way.meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. mine follow me everywhere. they sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. if something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. we hide together underneath a blanket.i love them so, so much.they haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. the thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as i do all because i had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. they belong with me and i belong to them. and my cats are both young. my little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. these cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. and i need to be here to serve them. i can't kill myself. i've got a job to do.
does anyone else think about suicide/death a lot but won’t actually do anything?
i just feel like death is constantly in my mind. i wonder when it will be. i wonder if it’ll hurt and what happens after. i often fantasize about dying in a horrible accident that way it wouldn’t be as bad as suicide to my family. just to think whenever i’m driving it’s just a pull towards a tree and i wonder what’s stopping me. i’m not trying to promote this thinking at all! just wondering if anyone else gets these thoughts? it’s just like death wont leave me alone.
does anyone have a hard time understanding how all people aren't actively suicidal
it makes no sense to me 
fuck relationships, whats the point anymore?
have you ever been hooked on someone knowing that you can never have them? well in my case my ex is my problem. ik people tell me to get over her and tell me that itll be alright but it fucking isnt i try my hardest to get my mind off of her, i try my hardest to move on but i cant stand being away from her. shes giving me the hardest time cause she says shes there for me 1 moment then the next shes telling me she doesnt care. fuck sake  if she keeps fucking with my feelings like this ill probably end it all and just be better cause right now im feeling that killing myself is the only way out of this pain please someone help me with some advice, i legit dont know how to cope :(
emergency: i'm a suicidal teen and my family is trying to end my life.
 .i won't give much context, but i (14m) got into an extremely heated argument with my dad over my academic future. i remained respectful, **but he started beating me** and he told me how i'm crazy for liking history and video games, and that i'm gonna suffer and die alone and that no one and nothing will ever love me. i started crying, a lot, and was going to kill myself, by jumping of our roof. however, my dad grabbed me and started beating me, whilst telling me that i wasn't his son anymore. i ran upstairs to my room, and locked the door (we have a special lock that can't be opened and i used that). **mom's not helping either, and she started beating me as well** because i ''upsetted her and god by wishing for suicide''it's been a few hours now, **and i'm extremely suicidal and i will certainly take my life unless i get immediate help from someone. i** have no trusted friends or adults around, and i live in a shitty third world country that doesn't have a good police force (besides they'll sympathise with my parents), and no emergency helplines. my phone has no battery either (im typing om computer), so i have no helpline i can reach out to (i think).please anyone, someone, i need some support of any kind. a simple dm, or something else like a helpline. please, i really don't wanna die, but i feel so useless.help me.**edit: i'm british, but i'm living in pakistan, if that matters.**
25, around 10k in debt, failed university, and today testicular tumor diagnosed. see you on the otherside.
babe i love you forever
when will people realise that when u are having a mental health crisis your thoughts are completely irrational? so sick of people not understanding what’s wrong and asking what’s wrong over and over when it’s just the dark feeling in my stomach getting too much attention from my brainb

does anyone else ever feel like they are destined to kill themselves?
i'm at the point where i don't even feel the sadness nor the depression. i'm slowly losing sense of my identity and feeling a vast wave of emptiness. i feel like my life isn't even mine anymore.
the indian lifestyle makes me feel stuck or trapped
for me, it’s specific to parenting.i feel like the community aspect of my culture has been taken to such an extreme hat i have been deemed nothing more than a poster child. a trophy for my parents to show off to other families like it’s some kindergarten show and tell.“oh my kid got the presidents award” or “my kid got a 1600 on sat and 32 on act” “my kid did 4000 hours of volunteer service and got accepted into princeton!” “oh yeah? my kid is getting a bioengineering degree at harvard!”of course i’m exaggerating to an extent but you get the point. such behavior leads to many parents setting high (and i mean high) expectations for their kids such as achieving a near-perfect report card as a high schooler taking college-level classes. to achieve this, parents attack verbally when failing to meet these expectations, or they constantly compare you to your peers and ask “why can’t you be like them???” which only leads to a resentment towards that peer, or they try to distance you from a social life and divert all the time in the world into studies and books and education and tests and college stuff. just to name a few.it’s been difficult to explain to my american friends this unique situation and i still feel like they don’t get it. the only advice i’ve ever gotten is to “just wait” to move out and go to college and you can go nc or lc. i’m doing that rn but god it just gets harder and harder the more i try to put up with this. my parents are also completely dismissive of mental health problems like depression or anxiety, as “oh your problems are all rooted to that phone of yours and constantly talking to your friends when you could be studying instead” or “you just need to put in the work to succeed and then you’ll be happy” and it’s like yeah that sounds great but i want to get a therapist. it feels like abuse but not to the extent that it is reportable. i don’t feel good about myself and i don’t think a parent-child relationship should be like this. i get respecting your elders but not to the detriment of my own needs. i get that my parents house and feed me and stuff but this should be a two-way street and i’ve been trying for years and years to please my parents but to no avail. rather, it feels hopeless and like i’m walking on eggshells. my grades are slipping and i don’t know what to do.
i made it to 16 :)

does anyone else feel suicidal almost everyday but not act on it ever?
when i say not act on it i mean i've never self harmed, never attempted any kind of suicide or damage. but everyday i wake up feeling like whats the point? the main reason i haven't is fear in case i mess it up and i am in pain or disabled for the rest of my life and the other is letting people down, worried my fiance and mum would blame themselves.i highly doubt i would ever do it but this is the worst i have ever felt. i have been fine for a while, got engaged just 2 weeks ago but now i am bad again.just looking for people in similar situations to talk to
it really sucks to have realized that life is meaningless at such a young age
i realized it when i was 16, i’m 18 now. there really is no point, you grow up, you get a job, you try to make money but always end up not having enough of it, then you die. it’s really sad because i wish there was a purpose but in reality there really isn’t. the only reason i haven’t killed myself yet is because of how sad i know my mom and dad would be. i couldn’t do that to them. they are so loving and they work so hard in this meaningless life just to do the same thing every other mid level family does. i probably won’t ever kill myself, im too much of a pussy, but god does it suck always wanting to be dead.thanks for all the support from everyone:) it has made me a bit happy to know that a lot of people understand. if you’d like, my whole situation is on my other post on my profile. give it a read if you really want to understand what i’m going thru
my depression has made me become such a good liar. it’s frightening.
when you tell everyone you’re okay but you’re actually not. you promise them you won’t do something, but your mind tells you otherwise. it’s hurts being under such intense emotional pain. it’s hard seeming like you’re the happiest person out there and fully functioning but know deep down inside while you’re alone that you’re so fucking unhappy. so fucking unhappy. 
i failed
a couple of days ago, i finally decided to end my life. i decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. so i went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. long enough for the water to get freezing cold. i used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. when i finally got out, i put on my dirty ass pajamas i’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. i tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. as i felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and i freaked the fuck out. i immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. i couldn’t get it back over my head and i was hyperventilating. when i finally got it off, i was just shaking like a leaf. i sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. i ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. but now, i’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and i’m regretting calling her at all. i wish i had just waited until i calmed down enough to try again. i don’t want to be here. i don’t want to be alive. and now i’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. i fucking hate this. i just want to drive my car off of a bridge. i can’t do this anymore. maybe when i go home i’ll gather all the pills i can find and try again. i can’t go into school. i can’t face the fucktards i call ‘friends’. i can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. i just want to go home. not back to my house. back to where i came from. i want to go back to the earth. i want to become one with the universe again, i want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. i wanna be stardust.edit: i’m okay now. i’m out of crisis mode and i’m just trying to take each day as it comes. thank you so much for your kind words and support, it’s helped a lot. thank you.
if anything goes wrong, my first thought is i'll just kill myself
example: i just totally failed my quiz today in class. my grade is teetering and i've somehow managed to get straight a's for 3 years of college. if i fuck this up (my perfect grades) after all this time... my grades are all i am... it's all that redeems me in my parents eyes... without it i am nothing. i don't even deserve to feel this bad, people are killing themselves on the street and i'm just some privileged fucker whining about a 4.0 gpa...i just want feel like i'm worth something and this is all i have left...
people only care after we are dead.
honestly the worst part of the process of recovering from mental illness, is no one cares enough to lend a helping hand despite knowing our situation except the one person you’re paying money to, the therapist. and then once we actually are gone, they start caring. until then we are alone in the fight, and are judged for not getting through the storm alone. i wish it was different but it feels like i am a laughing stock and stepping stone for people to trample on as some trash along the road. it’s great 
nobody even reads my sw posts
i’m tired of being the stupid kid that can’t fit in. i’m tired of being lonely and having no friends. i’m tired of always being the worthless piece of shit no one cares about. i just want to die. nobody would care if i killed myself. i wish i just did it in sixth grade.
you ever just have everything going for you, but you fuck it all up?
life was going well for me. high school was a breeze. i got into a good university for engineering. i had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend/bestfriend. i fucked it all up.it began with me being lazy in university. i procrastinated many assignments to the point where i ended a quarter with 3 f's. i try to fix my grades by the end of the school year. still have gpa above 2.0, so not kicked out yet. however, my fafsa application was declined because of the poor performance. that was the only way i could afford classes as i did not want to go in debt.i decide to do work and earn money. i got a job at mcdonald's and, luckily, did not have to work in service, only production--which is great since i'm introverted. i work there for 6 months and decide to quit one day. thought i'd be able to find a better paying job, but that proved to be more difficult than i imagined. that same year, i had relationship issues. around the end of february of last year, i found out my gf had cheated. though, it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy. i decided to forgive her and continue. fast forward to may 2018, she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him. i'm too in love, so i decide to give her another chance. 1 week later, i catch her sending nudes to the same guy. i forgive her again. december 2018. same time i quit my job. i'm unemployed. 6 months since the last time my gf did anything (i had been with her for 3 years, this was the one year it was bad). i'm looking for jobs, but no one is interested. i'm struggling.january 2019. 20-year-old honda begins to die. i'm left without a car for a month. girlfriend decides to leave me (to be clear, she meant the world to me. she was the only one close to me). i'm heartbroken. in a desperate attempt to save our relationship. i walk to her place, 10 miles away, a 4 hour walk. i promise everything...that everything would get better, and i would fix myself and our relationship. i'm rejected. i'm starting to lose it. i can't live in this world without her. she was the only one, the only reason i kept going. we talked of marriage and our future plans a lot. it was a set path, and just like that, it's gone. february 2019. the last time we talk.i have no one to talk to. she was the only one i could talk to about my personal problems. i had no other close friends. my relationship with my family is almost nonexistent. i'm stuck with all this hurt, and have no way to let it all out. i begin to hang out with my friends online, and begin to hang out with them irl. i tell them about my break up. that sucks, they say. that's all i get. i expected as much....march 2019. me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse. pay is decent and job isn't that demanding. i could do this.since the break up, however, i haven't felt happy at all. i struggle sleeping. any thought of her would just make me depressed. there's no escape from her. so many things remind me of her. i can't listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it. i break down one day and decide to message her. i explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person. no response.2 weeks after getting that warehouse job, i get fired. i hadn't shown up for 3 days without notice.i'm a failure.same week, i learned that someone had stolen my identity back in 2012. i learned about this after doing taxes and stuff. irs stated that i owed $4,000 from 2012. i was 11-years-old then. i didn't work. so i have that to deal with now. on top of that, i owe $2,000 for my car.recently, i've found out my ex has moved on to someone else. there goes my chances of ever fixing that again. to add, being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom i loved to hang out with. since shes no longer with me, i'm no longer friends with them. they were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school.so now, i'm a lonely, lazy, desperate, struggling failure that wants to end it all. i have a history of cutting. i cut so deep freshman year that i have huge scars on my left arm 5-6 years later. i almost committed suicide by stabbing myself, but i pussied out. after what happened to me and my ex in may 2018, i tried committing suicide again through overdose (unfortunately i lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family).i could have stayed in university if i had just done my homework. i could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner. i could be making money if i wasn't a quitter. i'm worthless. i've tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing i desire most now. i have nothing going for me. my relationship with other people isn't strong enough for me to stay. if i live, i'm only going to live in regret...wanting nothing more than to travel back in time and fix everything. i want to die so bad. i'm only 19, but i dont think i'm going to make it to 20.
declining people suicide, is a lot like forcing someone into a car, never letting them out until the car breaks down, and getting pissed off that they want out.

wrote many posts here and it's like the reality. always ignored. no matter what. this probably upsets me the most.

what else can i do instead of suicide?
could i run away to some obscure country? would i leave my old identity behind leave my mum make a missing person report?should i just do something completely fucking stupid and fuck my life up more? at least if everyone knows i’m useless then they won’t expect anything good from me and i’ll be left alone. i don’t want to kill myself that badly but i don’t want to continue living, not like this. my situation isn’t even that bad, i just can’t get this anxiety, insecurity, overthinking, depression out of my fucking head. for years and years i’ve been trapped. maybe escaping for a little while but always reverting back and almost always worse. i just cannot be fucking bothered living anymore. im tired 24/7. socialising is so difficult with this mess in my head, and all i want is friends and a partner but all i do is lose friends and isolate myself because i’m fucked in the head. i just don’t know what to do, i feel like maybe i’ve got some undiagnosed autism or something because i just feel like my brain works differently and i just dont know what to do about 95% of the time. my “cool confidence” is completely fake, i’m just trying to fake it till i make it but it’s obviously fake, i just embarrass myself again and again. maybe i’m asking for advice, maybe i’m venting. this subreddit is so great, i can relate to so many other sad souls and that makes me feel a little bit better.edit: thanks for all the great replies everyone. i wish i could give a meaningful reply to all of them but it would take too long. <3 you all
hey, i reached out on here a while ago, it's one of the main reasons i'm still here. just want to say thank you. i'm in a better place now.

we're all suicidal people who tell other people to stay alive
in most cases, that's the truth.
does anyone else feel a sense of calm and peace when thinking about suicide?
i do, and it scares me. i used to feel panicked and anxious when thinking about suicide and, which would end up in a decent crying session.for a while now however, i just feel calm and relieved when thinking about it. it's nice to feel that there's always a solution available if things go badly wrong, or if i'm too stressed, when all my life i've only heard to just suck it up and keep moving on to fuck things up all over again.i just want to know if anyone else has had this, because thinking like that scares me. i don't want to end it, i know my family cares about me, and i don't want them to suffer.i've had these thoughts for a long time now. the difference is that i don't think negatively about suicide now.thank you for taking the time for reading, please share your thoughts/experience if you can and want to. it would help me feel i'm not alone.
does anyone else love sleeping because you get either dreams or a sense of nothingness, both of which feel better than being awake?
i sleep a lot. as much as i can.feels good to fade away and stop existing for a while.when i have dreams i dream i’m a normal, happy person. i dreamed recently this girl i used to know was my girlfriend. she was having dinner at my place with my family. my parents looked so proud.if i don’t dream, the sense of oblivion is great too. maybe that’s why i want to die so bad. it’s basically just sleeping forever.
i graduated tonight
i graduated tonight, and i honestly did not think i would live to be here for graduation. i’m kind of proud of myself.
mental hospitals never work
so a bit of backstory: in my state, if you show any sign of wanting to hurt yourself or others, can you be forcibly sent to a mental hospital (for a max of 3 days) after going to the er to check if you've tried anything and being assessed by a psychologist (for at least 30 minutes). this has happened to me twice. the first time, i only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully i was released after a few hours.the second time however, was much worse. so i went to the er, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later after being sent to the mental hospital (which i'm 99% sure is illegal). also, i didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after i arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. not to mention while in the er, i overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. while in the mental hospital place, i never actually got better. i just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.&#x200b;tldr; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.edit: some other bs at happened at the second time (which was at a university hospital, btw) included: because my family was calling so much the psychologist outright complained to me about how they were making her job harder. my mom tried to make sure i got evaluated before i left the er but while my mom was talking with the nurse, the nurse hung up and said im sorry, but this is getting annoying right to my face.a diabetic girl was basically being starved because it was the weekend and they couldnt get a nutritionist on the weekend, so a nurse had to sneak her sandwiches.while at the er, i overheard nurses/service techs complain about the mental health patients.
i wish i would get a terminal illness so i could die without having to kill myself

i’m not even going to bother using a throwaway
try as i may, every evening ends the same. i can drink 8 gallons of water, ace a job interview, run a marathon, and by the time i lay in bed and stare at the ceiling the same thoughts race through my mind. “i don’t want to be alive.”i love that communities like this exist. but, at the end of the day, a suicide hotline or a stranger on the internet telling me “it’ll be okay, buddy” doesn’t fix the fundamental problematic default setting of my brain.chronic depression is hell, plain and simple. it’s a constant uphill battle. and lately i feel like sisyphus, no matter how hard i push my disease up a hill, it’s going to come tumbling back down to crush me under its weight eventually.i’m so tired of pushing stones up hills. i’m so, unbelievably, fucking tired. 
self harm and substance abuse are not causes, they are symptoms.
i'm sick of people focusing on stuff that will return if you you dont help with the main issue, it's like taking away a kids phone cause they are suicidal
life is a precious gift. so the creator should love it when i give it back.
it doesn't get better. it really doesn't. 
ever see any of your childhood photos and think someone should have killed that kid. or i'd love to go back and time and end them.?
i know that is beyond dark, but i'm just wondering if i'm not alone in that line of thinking. i admit i was adorable, but sometimes i think about everything leading up to now and wonder if an earlier death would have been best.
i wish i could die without killing myself
like i wish i could just get into an accident and die then that way i wouldn’t have to do it myself. idk it’s fucked up to think that but i think about it all the time
i'm sick and tired of people telling me you're too young to be depressed
i am 11 years old. my dad committed suicide when i was 8. as he was a stay-at-home dad, i had so much experience with playing with him and talking in general. i haven't really talked to many people or made relationships with anyone following that event. seemingly every week some adult is telling me that i'm too young to be depressed, like damn when did they make an age cap. i've thought about suicide for the last 3 years but have only tried once, which failed bad, but recently with people comparing depression to my age constantly it makes me want to try again.thanks for readingedits: hey guys, i just want to thank you all so much for the 30+ positive messages you have sent me. i never expected i would get more help in under 24 hours than i ever had in 3 years. as much as this makes me happy, it also comes to my concern s that there are some horrible people browsing this reddit. i have received multiple messages telling me to do certain things to myself. here is an example: https://imgur.com/gallery/tdycb
i just want a hug
is that too much to ask
school is just so fucked. most of the people on this sub are students
i fucking hate everything and this is the 3rd year in a row that i’d just rather die than put up with this shit. i just don’t want to hurt people around me. 
vote up if you think i should live (ha)
title is some humour because intergalactic laws dont matter right nowi dont think i will be alive much longer, a month away seems very far. my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyonethe one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself, it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle.i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you, etc..  i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me. the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford, i cant afford rent either. i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work. i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boringthere is no real support either, not unless you pay them which isnt real support imho either. i was seeing a therapist, stopped two weeks ago
i deserve to die because i’ve done awful things
not saying what they were. they were not things i knew were wrong till later. if i had known then how much it would hurt people i would never ever done it. i don’t want to hurt anyone, but i have and i haven’t meant to. so all my suffering now is punishment for doing the awful things i didn’t know were awful till much later.
talk to someone yeah i did and it's pointless, rant
talking doesn't make anything better, it just means one more person knows how fucked up and far gone i am, and they can't do anything about it. i've come to realise that there's no hope and i'm better off alone until i can go through with completion. fuck my brain and demons, i can't wait until i delete myself from the gene pool, such a rejected waste of fucking oxygen and space
i'm waking up tomorrow.
i was sure of it. tonight was supposed to be night. my depression was always there, but something told me that tonight was the night i would end it all and relieve myself from this pain.but i didn't. i found myself crying for 2 hours, and then finally picking up the phone for the suicide hotline. i spoke to the most wonderful person on the other end. he told me i was strong, he told me i deserved to live, he told me i was a good person. he gave me a new perspective on how to tackle life. he saved my life.so, for now, i put the tools away, the notes away, and will not send those texts tonight. because, for better or worse,i'm waking up tomorrow.
goodbye, r/suicidewatch.
not long ago i posted here. this throwaway then went dormant. after struggling a few months after i had posted, i had a breakdown in front of a friend. he talked to me for three hours and helped me as much as somebody who isn't me could help. i continued to fight my own personal battle.i won. i fucking won. i learned to not hate people anymore (go ahead and read the other posts if you please). i learned to enjoy life again. i'm smiling as i write this post. i've started helping people as much as i could, and being my gamer self i've sent steam gifts to people who can't afford their own hobby (better gaming than drugs or something, right?). hopefully this is the last time i'll ever post here. it's kinda funny looking back and seeing myself one month ago. i'm a totally new person.so... goodbye.
be careful who you talk to
i’m a female who had an issue with suicide (still do) and who i thought was a friend came over to help me through it. all was good until he proceeded to force himself on me. he used my fragile mental state to take advantage of me. this happened over a week ago and he hasn’t spoken to me since. be aware of who you speak to about this because i don’t want what happened to me to happen to someone else.
just got raped a few hours ago. please someone talk to me before i slit my wrists.
its midnight and im sitting outside. i took a 3hour long shower and i still feel disgusting. i dont know this person. i was out jogging and he jumped me. literally almost ripped my lip off. forced himself on me. im a 17 year old guy. i just need someone to call. i dont know what to do i feel awful.
mcdonald's employee just saved my life.
this is probably not the right subreddit, but whatever. i just needed to say this.it was 4 am. i was cold. i was lonely. i was tired. i was intoxicated. i was depressed. i was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.but i hadn't eaten in three days, and i sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.i stepped outside and lit a cigarette. it was going to be the last cigarette i would ever smoke.i walked to my local mcdonald's. it was the only place still open. it was completely empty. there was one employee left, manning the cash register.i placed my order and pulled out my debit card.sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes.i nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. i could wait for 10 minutes.i listened to the song on the radio. just a couple more minutes, he said.another song went by. then another, then another, then another, and another... he walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. don't worry about it, he said.confused, i walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. so is it ready yet?don't worry about it.i was shocked. thank you, sir.i walked out, returned home, and had the best, free, 5 dollar meal i've ever had in my entire life.i won't kill myself tonight. maybe i won't, ever. thanks man.
my therapist said i had over 5 lives' worth of trauma packed into my 25 years. i don't think the bad times stop. i'm ready to go.
hi there. my name is anna. i'm 25f. this post is going to be incoherent, because i can't really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore. i don't expect anyone to read this, and if you do, i'm sorry.  i've got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different. the one person i told everything too is so tired. i love him very much, but i know caring about me is a burden. he needs more consistency, stability, and sustainability-- things i don't think i can offer with my brain.i think this is a vent, but also the closest thing to a suicide now that i have. it's just the truth of my life, and why i'm ready for it to be over. i was raped at the ages of 4, 8, 14, 19 and 24, some of those years included multiple times. i've been kidnapped / sold. i've been a victim in a shooting. i've been forced to watch children die (murdered). i found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten. i've been severely stalked. i watched my mother lose her battle with cancer. i've had friends murdered in college. i've been severely beaten. hungry/starved. homeless. there's been so much. and i'm so, so tired. if anything, i just want boring years where nothing happens, but i don't think that's possible. everyone says the bad times don't last, that others have had it worse. i'm just so tired. i'm so tired of hearing these things from people who don't have to live with my brain or experiences. people tell me i'm so strong but i feel so weak.  i don't want to fight to live. i don't want to survive anymore. i wouldn't even call this a crisis because i'm just so ready, so calm and numb.if my guy sees this, i'm sorry i couldn't give you everything you needed. i'm sorry i couldn't get better.  take care of the cats for me. i hope you find happiness, comfort, warmth and love.  see you, space cowboy.
i hate “it gets better”
i was told that continually during my lowest points. but its only gotten so much worse. so much so that my lowest points now seem like my highestsometimes it doesnt get betteri cant fucking stand this
i am a ghost
i deleted everything. this is the only social media i'm still active on. everything else is gone. i cut all ties. i haven't talked to freinds in days. i feel completely invisible. but i like it this way. i no longer have to make an ass of myself in front of loved ones. maybe this is a better alternative to suicide... or maybe the first step.
i’m 17 and my life is over..,
i was finally becoming happy. i had a job i loved, i was coming to terms with my family troubles and leaving them behind. i’ve made friends better than any i’ve ever had before and yet i am depressed. i used to think i was depressed an anxious the whole way though high school. i wasn’t depressed, i was sad. maybe more than my friends yes, but not depressed. and i wasn’t anxious, i was just a nervous kid and i forced myself out of my comfort zone and overcame my nervousness. 7 months ago, i got tinnitus. an incurable chronic condition which causes a ringing in my head. for 3 months i was coping with it. until january. i began to develop hypercausis, a side effect of the condition. this side effect is extremely severe. it causes me to perceive normal sound as painful. i am unable to continue my passion of music and playing instruments and it makes everything else in my life almost unbearable. around the same time i developed and anxiety disorder. my heart now constantly pounds in my chest and i have frequent panic attacks. i haven’t heard silence in 7 months, and i never will again.my heart hasn’t stopped pounding for 4 months, and it never will again.this is not living, this is coping.all the positive thinking in the world isn’t going to cure me. nothing will.i have good friends and a family who care about me, but it doesn’t matter. none of it does.
better. i am better.
just wanted to put it in writing. i played football today and studied well. i am meant to be dead but i stayed. introduced meditation exercise and immense focus on my thoughts. this is a war but i am starting to win a lot more battles. i don’t see this as the end, but the beginning of something better.
my friend just shot himself in the head and we are left with nothing but questions and misery
there’s really nothing to say.  he had a beautiful five year old child and parents who cared about him and friends who are now very fucking pissed off.  this is bullshit.  i’m sitting here on reddit because there is nothing to do or say.  he was a great friend and the only person who didn’t criticize me or call me a coward for attempting suicide.  he would always say “me too bro.  it hurts every day”.  and now he’s gone.  fuck you.
every single morning that i wake up i become upset that i’m still alive.

i didn't fucking ask to be here.
this is what infuriates me. you can't kill yourself, think of how it will hurt your family. i didn't fucking ask to be in this situation. if you had given me a choice, i would have said no thanks. now because i had the misfortune of existing, i have to suffer through the rest of my life for other people? fuck that. i love my family, in fact that's precisely why i hate life. knowing my mom is going to die and everyone else i love is going to die. life fucking blows. i would do anything to just cease existing.
does anybody else feel like suicide is their inevitable destiny
i've always felt that i'd never have to work a full time job or go through college because i have this constant, recurring feeling of fate that i'll eventually kill myself. anyone else have this feeling?
thinking of killing myself comforts me because if everything gets too much to handle, i always have a choice to way out.
i don't know if anyone else feels this way, but lately i've been thinking about suicide a lot and it really makes me feel better that i can always make the choice when i want to. and that i don't need to deal with any consequences that come after, although it might sound selfish.
mom just basically told me to go to hell and she’s not listening to me anymore. next time the house is free i am going to prepare me suicide method. this is it i’m finally taking the next step. what a fucking horrible way to treat someone you know is suicidal.
edit: a lot of comments are abusing my mom and saying to cut her off. she cares for me but she had left me crying and hadn’t literally said ‘go to hell’. i used that term perhaps colloquially and she basically told me that she isn’t sticking around to listen to me and stick around to hear me refuse to do anything. she merely left me alone in my room to hurt while she went to make dinner for my brother or whatever. i apologize to those who took it literally. bad communication on my part
my mom attempted suicide today
tw: kind of graphic description of suicide attempt so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her cpr. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the er waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a ct scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 am on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up. 
if you're upset about the election, the place to seek help is not by inviting discussion about it on the internet. including here.
we know that the us election results are adding to the burden of fear and despair that many of you are carrying.  but this particular election has brought a lot of legitimate rage to the surface, and secondarily given others an excuse to unleash indiscriminate aggression against the most vulnerable people they can find.we know that for some of you tonight might feel like the last straw.  it's completely understandable that you'd want help, but the wide-open internet is not the place to seek it right now.  due to the amount of brigading, abuse, and argument they're attracting, we're taking down all political posts.  please seek mental-health support through true crisis resources, which we are not.  the sidebar/community info has links if you need them.
i feel like i lie and fake all my issues and i hate it
i feel like i make everything up and don’t truly have any issues or need any help
i just wish i could die a tragic death without me killing myself
a lot has gone wrong i’ll just leave it at that
my 13 yo daughter overdosed on about 6 grams of wellbutrin and 1500mg of zoloft.
i am trying so hard to make this right. she was airlifted to children’s hospital and now she’s laying in her hospital bed unresponsive and her muscles are jerking. this has been the scariest day of my life. that child is my entire world. she’s all i have. i have out my heart and soul into raising her. i never want to lose this little girl. but here i am. she’s about to be 14. she’s a little on the eccentric side, but she has a heart of gold. she’s never met a stranger. but ever since 8th grade has started, she has been getting bullied. and the teachers don’t really do anything about it. this was her way of coping. i went to wake her for school this morning and found her covered in vomit and she had been hallucinating and having seizures for hours probably. what if i hadn’t found her?why does she feel like this is the only way? i want to make all the bad go away. how do i do this? how do i help her cope? i didn’t know who to turn to, so i’m turning to reddit. please help me understand how to help her. **updatemy daughter is still in recovery but she’s come so far! we are no longer in icu. we were moved to the special care unit which is a step down. she doesn’t remember anything. she doesn’t even remember school that day. she’s so upset that this happened. she said she doesn’t understand why and how she did it. she was hallucinating pretty bad over the last couple of days but that has subsided tremendously, if not completely. she’s still unable to determine if she’s in reality or if this is a dream.  and it’s heartbreaking to tell her this is reality, but this reality is way better than the one i thought i would have. i am the luckiest woman on earth.  
today, i've reached one of the lowest points in my life. i hope you finish reading my post.
hello. right now, there are a lot of words that have stopped really reaching me for a while now. i'm still here. i can't afford to be gone. i am the pillar of other people. that's why, right now, when i'm at my weakest, i have to ask strangers to be my pillar. i'm not really expecting much. i'm just hoping that somewhere, there's someone who's reading my thoughts and letting me be my vulnerable self. maybe after you've read this post, maybe you could take half a minute to wish me better luck. i'm not religious, but you can also wish me blessings. at this point, i'd take anything. but for just reading this, i'd like to say thank you.

i didn't kill myself thanks to this subreddit. <3 you guys
9 days ago on saturday, i decided to kill myself. wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain i would cause to my family and friends. i just woke up that morning and realised i could not take another fucking day. i was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than i was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. funny thing was the knowledge that i was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. i didn't do anything special. same old shit. i even finished off a school assignment for some reason. i don't know why. played xbox. went to gym. went for a run. talked to a few people on skype. walked my dog. had dinner. dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. said goodbye to my dog, told her i hoped other people would walk her when i was gone. said goodnight to my parents for what i thought would be the last time. hugged my grandma goodnight. went to my room and locked the door. decided to smoke some weed one last time. by then it was about 10:30 and i knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so i had some time to kill. said i’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. went to this subreddit. read through all the top submissions and realised i had never tried to fight this. i had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. it helped that i was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me i was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. the next day was shit. still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. but i legitimately tried to get better. and by the end of the day i had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. i felt happy for a little bit. and i realised that i would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. it was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while i was listening to some music. in the days that followed things haven't improve much but i haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  i’m determined to beat this one way or another. i’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. but whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.much love. 
why are we only appreciated when we’re finally gone?
for fucks sake, it bothers me how many people say such kind words at funerals of people who killed themselves. why couldn’t you say that when they were alive?? most of the time they felt so unloved they wanted to take their own life, because no one stopped to say that they appreciate them. that’s at least how i feel.i don’t know if i believe in some kind of afterlife, whether it be heaven or living out a life as a ghost. but part of me wants to kill myself, just to be able to watch my own funeral. call me an attention whore, i get it. but god damn. how do people really feel about me? and how many people are faking it? i want to know if my father tells the truth when he says he couldn’t live without me. i want to know if my mother can finally say that she loves me at my own funeral. i wonder what kind of words my only two friends will say, and i want to see if they actually cared. if they actually were my friends. there’s so much i want to know, and all of it is basically craving to know that someone gives a shit. and if killing myself is the only way of giving myself a chance to see that, why shouldn’t i?
99% of people regretted it!
please, i planned that overdose for so damn long. even got myself an alibi! enough to kill at least three people, but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me. legit, when i was passing out, i have never been so happy, so relieved, that everything was finally going to be over. the first time i attempted, i was fourteen and i was so happy when i passed out and thought it was over. every time, even.can you imagine how angry and disappointed i was this time when i woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so i wasn't a danger to myself? for nearly three days i was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because i was hysterical and dangerous and agitated and all those words to describe someone who just really really really wanted to die. three weeks later in the psychiatric ward, most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because i refused medication. it's easier to pacify someone who isn't given the right to function, i suppose. now i'm back out on suicide watch.i don't understand how someone can put people through shit like that for their own good. well, i guess it worked in a fucked up way. now i want to die more than i've ever wanted to, but i'm so fucking terrified it's going to go wrong and i'll be locked up & left to rot tied to the bed again because i've been in the hospital so many times that they just don't know what to do with me. why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer? i have not reached out for help, i've only tried to die on my own terms, and i get treated like a violent criminal. do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a hospital against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you?why the fuck do people do this to other people? it's so much worse than dying, and now they've even taken away the last freedom i thought i had. i really don't want to live, but i'm too scared to try to die. i can't go through that again. maybe 99&#37; of people regretted it, but for ten long years i've never once regretted it. they don't believe me, though. they just lock me up and throw me back out when they've given up or when i'm stable. i'm not a person to them, i'm just cattle that comes in, gets processed and punished if i resist, and thrown back out. nobody gives a fuck about me, and nobody does anything if i complain because every record tells how hysterical and dangerous and agitated and suicidal i am. no rights, no problems.how is this okay? how is this the world i live in? how can i possibly want to live? why am i put through all this just for trying to die?
i just die inside when my parents mention things i will do in the future even though i have no intention on living that far...
like when my parents say “when you finish university” “when you get a job” “when you get a girlfriend” “when you’re my age” shit hurts cuz i don’t plan on living that long. 
i have sexual thoughts about kids. i'm 26. please don't hate me, i already hate myself more than you ever will.
i wasn't always this way.  but sometime around 2011, i began to notice that i felt certain urges and thoughts when near prepubescent children.  they aren't urges to hurt them or, god forbid, do *that* to them...but i would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet.that sounds really strange, and this requires some backstory on me: since my teens, i've been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom (don't ask why, who the hell knows).  it mostly pertained to people my age...but then i accidentally came across a kid (google image, i don't go to any...*sites*, good lord) and found myself equally aroused.  i was horrified.i know this is really, really gross and sick, i know.  it's happening more and more often, these thoughts.  i had a therapist who knew, but when she moved away, i had no one.  trust me, it takes months or even *years* to build up that kind of trust for me.  i can't even say the...word...itself because i am so sickened by how i think sometimes.believe me: you cannot hate me more than i hate myself.  i nearly attempted suicide twice in college and it was a big part of my rationale for truly attempting suicide in march.  please, please, just...be kind.  that's all i want.  i've never felt more alone.
hey suicide watch family, im just checking in :)
the homeless shelter has been going very nicely, this new city i'm staying in has many kind donators who keep us fed and clothed.the shelter assigned me a case manager that will help me stay on track and focused toward getting on my feet and helping me get my own apartment.ive met some very interesting people, and they all have been very friendly towards me so far.we all like to hangout and chit chat in this garden and also watch court cases together :plove love love you guys.
you know your life is an absolute wreck when you casually debate in your head whether you should go to college or commit suicide instead.
this is really the state of my life right now. applied, got accepted, and getting ready to finalize everything. college starts in a month and i still haven't chosen yet. with each passing day, the latter seems more and more appealing.
just tried, my cat saved me
my hair's soaked and i put away the razor. was in the tub cutting myself to end it all, door was closed but my cat got in and meowed at me and wouldn't leave. got out of the tub and in bed cuddling with him. he saved me, but i wish he hadn't. but i'm safe for now i guess
on the verge of giving up
i am being harassed and the legal system is set up to protect the people harassing me more than me. i keep begging the police for help and  they seem sympathetic but tell me that they can't do anything since i am not being threatened. i just lost one of my jobs over this and have no idea what i am going to do. there is no justice in the justice system.i am going broke from legal fees, bills, and unexpected expenses. the job i lost was only part-time but that $400 a month matters. my ex destroyed my credit so i can't even rely on that. my electric is going to get shut off because the equal pay plan ended and i don't have the money to pay the rest of the bill.i have a vet bill that needs to be paid because my cumstain of an ex never paid it and i moved so i didn't get the bill. my cat is epileptic and takes medication. she has to get bloodwork every year and i don't know how i am going to afford both the old bill and the new one. i'm so fucking useless that i can't even properly take care of my cat.i have a new boyfriend but i'm having trouble enjoying it. he reached out to play with my hair yesterday and i flinched so obviously that he pulled back. he told me it's okay, he understands, and even apologized to me for scaring me. *he* apologized to *me* like he did something wrong. i'm the one that's so broken that i pull away from kindness. he deserves so much better than what i can offer.i am exhausted to the bone. i'm averaging 3 hours of sleep a night and it's interrupted by nightmares. every noise sends me into a panic and i feel too vulnerable to sleep with headphones on.my anxiety is so high that it has  reached the stratosphere. i can't leave my apartment alone without feeling like the ground is going to give way. i can only go out when i am with someone and i just feel so goddamn pathetic asking people to come with me to the store. the panic attacks are brutal and i find myself hoping one will just give me a heart attack and be done with it.i'm just so fucking tired of fighting and getting nowhere. every time i think things are getting better, something happens and they get worse.
i would like to dedicate this to the memory of all the people /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression have lost over the years.
many nights, as i am laying in bed, i think about you lot and all those we have lost. i think about the posts i have read on here, of those i have replied to and those who came here to say goodbye. i remember and i wonder, did she walk off into the woods that night to overdose in peace, did he hang himself in his basement, did he jump from the top of those offices and did she walk away into the cold to never be seen again? did these people go through with it or where they persuaded otherwise, did they succeed and did they find the peace and release they wanted?for the most part, we rarely learn your names, we are usually only left to remember your reddit username and even then, this is one of the only things we know about you. i will be honest, i do not actually remember your usernames for i see so many everyday but i do remember you guys. i think about you often and i just hope that you did find the peace you went to seek. i hope that you found what you were looking for, or something better. if you are still with us, i hope you found that epiphany instead, the one so many of us are fortunate enough to have, and i hope you learned what you have to live for.but for those of you who came here to say goodbye, i do respect you all so much. in reading your words, i am pleased to know that you had thought it through and though you were wanting to end the pain, you did it for the happiness that peace would bring - you knew what you were doing and truly wanted it and were not just doing it out of desperation on the instance of of a thought.i just want you guys to know that, though we may not know, or remember, your names, we do think of you often. you are remembered by those that did not know you and truly missed by those who did. you were remembered and all of you always will be. good luck to everyone reading this and to the memories of those who no longer can. see you in another life, brother.this is for those who helped to save others. this is for those who could not be saved. this is for those who may need saving. this is for those who are reading this. this is for those who are not. this is for those who no longer can. this is for you. see you in another life, brother.
bye r/suicidewatch. i’m getting. therapy.
my mom saw my cuts and now i’m gonna get therapy. i got help accidentally. yay i guess? i hope all of you get the help you need.
“if only they would have reached out” = pure bullshit
  i see it all over the news in these ‘mental health campaigns’, some celebrity going on about how depressed people just need to talk about it. i can already picture people i know saying after my death, “if only he would have reached out”, “if only he would have talked about it”. this is fucking bullshit and they can all fuck right off. i reached out, i tried to talk to so many of you so many times, but you gave me nothing back, nothing! you can only reach out or talk, if people are willing to listen and people are not. i have always been told that i don't smile much, like it was an accusation. no-one ever bothered to ask if i was okay. i wish the transition from life-to-death was a bit easier. it's not nice to know my last moments will be filled with instinct driven panic and regret. i just want it all to stop. i need it to stop. i'm tired.
do you guys ever wish that there was a simple button that would give you instant and painless death when you press it?
if there was such a button, i would have pressed it long time ago...
why can't there be an easy and peaceful way to die?
i've wanted to kill myself for a while now, but i'm afraid of suffering or being in a panicked situation even if it's only for the brief moment. why are the only options inhumane methods? it's so stupid that society is against assisted suicide, especially because what's the harm with it? some might say it's unethical, well it's also unethical to force someone to kill themselves inhumanely... i hate this. 
listening to music while drunk is amazing
hopefully i won’t wake up tomorrow
does anybody actually wake up every day thinking wow i can't wait for another one?
it's just day after day of agony, i can't comprehend that people actually enjoy it.
my experience with “reaching out”.
ppl: “people need to reach out when they’re feeling suicidal. there’s help available out there. you matter!”me: *reaches out*ppl: “omg you’re just looking for attention lol stop being so overdramatic.”
the suicide hotline saved my life last night
i was very nervous about calling but i don't regret it at all. amazing resource
...
feeling unappreciated. like people won’t accept me for who i am. that i’m uninteresting and a burden.i’m tired of acting happy.i’m tired of living.i want to leave... but fear stops me.i don’t want to hurt my family.i don’t get treated well.emotions hold me back.nothing excites me.my future ambitions are gone.i love sleeping because it’s the closest thing to death. i’ve started working out, eating healthier.a lot of things i want are given to me.i’m thankful for all of it, but that won’t save me.i just want love.from anyone. a family member, perhaps a friend or stranger.but i feel that even if i find love it won’t be enough.when will i ever be satisfied?i guess i’m stuck here until natural events are the end of me...
my girlfriend committed suicide, and i'm worried i'll end up doing the same
my girlfriend of over 5 years committed suicide a few days ago, and i feel like i'm fucking dying inside. on one hand, i feel so much emotional pain that it's killing me, but on the other hand, i also feel so numb and empty and lost. i can't process it.i wanted to propose to her. the worst part is that the reason she did it was because she was being sexually abused by a friend of mine for years, but kept it a secret from everyone because she was being blackmailed by him. i feel like it's my fault. i should have realised. i should have stopped it from happening. i can't believe i let that piece of shit anywhere near her. i feel so much guilt that it's driving me crazy.my head is a mess. i haven't left the house for days. i haven't spoken to anyone. i've been ignoring all the phone calls and text messages from my family and friends because i can't bear talking about it because i don't want to acknowledge that it's reality. i haven't opened the door to anyone who's tried to come and visit me.i can't sleep properly, i've practically been starving myself. i just keep thinking that i wanna die. in the shower, i wanna drown. in the kitchen, i wanna take a knife and just end it. i can't take this feeling. i just want her back, i love her so much, and i don't know what i'm going to do without her.i hate everything right now. and that evil fucking son of a bitch is probably gonna get off free and not even gonna go to prison because i don't have any good evidence. everything's just a mess, and i feel like i'm not fully in control of my own actions at the moment. i don't want my family to find me dead, but i feel like it's what's gonna end up happening if i can't get my shit together. sorry for the long post 
it’s just sad because the only thing i see in my future is eventually killing myself.
i am just imagining doing it now. it sounds so nice, peaceful. i just want things to be quiet. somewhere beautiful. i won’t kill myself today, and not tomorrow.i know that killing myself means hurting my family. i’ve seen how suicides affect people. but i’m in so much pain. i’m 4 days clean from cutting. the mental and physical pain are so much sometimes.anytime i’m feeling something other than sadness or depression i know it will fade.i feel like i see the world for what it is when i’m depressed. i’m more creative when i can think.idk i’m just kind of ranting.you guys don’t need to send me to someone to talk. i’m okay. today’s my first day of being on a new antidepressant so eventually i will get better.i am seeing a psychologist though i think i need to talk more often to them.
must feel amazing to not want to kill yourself at least 5 times a day.
i don't even remember what a normal life feels like after starting this beautiful depressive journey in october 2017. some of you are so unbelievably strong that you are still here after eternities of pain.&#x200b;also blows my mind that there are people out there who don't want to kill themselves at least 5 times a day. &#x200b;&#x200b;rough life, eh? 
stop trying to fucking guilt trip me
*“your family will be so distraught if you hurt yourself!!!”**”you have no idea how much of an impact suicide will have on those around you!”**“imagine the reaction of your parents! imagine them reading the note! receiving the call!”*....wtf,,,, i know you have good intentions but *please*is this really supposed to make me feel better? all it does is fill me with guilt,,, and fills me with the realization that i have to live in fucking pain until the day i die,,, or until everyone who “cares about me” will die.
i understand suicide
i'm starting to understand people who commit suicide. it's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. you have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. you just don't want to fight through the day anymore. i think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. for some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. being alive and living are two different things. maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking, they couldn't give a minute to realize. death is funny like that; it's not always on a physical level. i have struggled with my depression the majority of my life. while those i care about thought i've gotten better, the reality is, i've just gotten better at hiding it. there are nights that i lie awake dreading waking up, living the day that just ended again, over and over. it's a cycle that never ends...nothing ever changes. nothing good is sustained. life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today. every bad decision plagues me and losses i've suffered haunt my thoughts. on the rare occasion i attempt to reach out, i know i will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand. there is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line. night before last, while lying awake, i realized i understood people who committed suicide. that scared me. i am in a dark place and i have never felt more alone in my life. this is a time where i could have used the most support. at this time i no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships. it's taking so much effort and i need to put everything i have left into my children. they have to be my primary focus and i'm just not sure i have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter/sister etc.
i never had anyone to support me or genuinely care about me. i turned 22 and i’ve realized how pathetic my life is. i graduate soon, and i plan on going away forever... the thought of that is my only relief right now.

so the suicide hotline just hung up on me. twice.
i have no one. having a breakdown. called them for the first time ever. apparently i wasn't suicidal enough. fuck me, right?
suicide hotline hung up on me
i told them everything that was happening and that i don't want to go on and they said sorry we couldnt help you and disconnected. are you fucking kidding me? like i was placing an order at taco bell. i feel like they answered my problem right there. it's a good thing i don't have my pistol. fuckin hell. how can you claim to help anyone suicidal with resources that can't help people? now i want to run headfirst into traffic. 
this sandwich doesn't taste good.
it doesn't. bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. it doesn't really taste like anything at all. it should, though. it's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. i'm a heathen of sandwiches). tons of flavor. i used to love this sandwich, and i'd eat it while doing things i loved to do. it was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. i think the only thing i never used this sandwich for was foreplay. mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   i guess it's not just the sandwich. on my other monitor, i'm rewatching dragonball z for the umpteenth time. majin buu is paused, looking like an idiot. i love dragonball z. watching it is supposed to make me happy. same with everything else i've tried watching for the past two days...west wing, pacific rim, jurassic park, freakazoid. temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. nothing is.  i'm so exhausted. i've been exhausted for weeks. but sleeping is terrible. all i do is lie there and think about people i've hurt, friends i've lost due to ways i've treated them. there is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. i catch glimpses of them -- accidental snapchat stories and things like that. i look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so i can hear them talk to me again. it's a common fallacy in the world that somehow taking responsibility for your actions makes everything okay. i almost wish i was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, i'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing i can do about it. so i lie there, listening to white noise or comforting asmr videos to try and keep my brain at bay. usually though, i'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? how will certain outliers in my social circle find out? who will be mad, who will be devastated?  i never intended on posting to this subreddit. i've lurked here many times when i was feeling suicidal, and i'm not exactly sure why. reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. and typically, i'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when i'd read other peoples' stories. stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. the worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. me? i'm just...weak, i guess.  i've been fighting off my own death since i was 14-ish. i've attempted suicide a handful of times already. i was a cutter as a teenager, then i moved to more drastic attempts. had to be talked down from an overpass once. my most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my klonopin prescription, march 2017. that was the closest i've gotten to death. right after i did it, i called my mom. i wanted to die but...i was still scared. i was sobbing on the phone. when she realized what i'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. by the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. i'd lost motor function. i vaguely remember the phone call, and i vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  anyway. this sandwich doesn't taste good. life has lost its flavor, and i'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  in november 2017, my life broke down. hard. i had been living on my own, in vegas. i had a great job with a great company, making decent money. it was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view i was unhappy. but if i looked at things in a macro sense, i was doing great. i had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time i was working bananas hours, i was hopefully working towards a new promotion. i had goals. i was really trying. i was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. everybody was on board with my mental health. i was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. my therapist and i were several months into the process and i felt comfortable talking to her. i was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  so, then it all just went poof. i broke down. stopped going to work. stopped talking to anyone. just, abruptly, one day. didn't show up, didn't call. my brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. i hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to facebook. eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. i returned, but nothing changed. i lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than i could. i went to be with my parents in ohio to try and sort myself out. stayed there for about a month. visited family. tried to re-center myself. same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to vegas in january.  got back to vegas. walked into my apartment and i realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. i was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. and that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. i'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. calling, texting, trying to reach me, and i'd blown them off. their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. you can't help someone who won't help themselves.  and that's exactly what happened. all through january, i stayed holed up in my apartment. i burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. i neglected my bills. i didn't care, at all. i let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when i was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. it was fine by me. i just...i felt like i had been switched off. whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and i was just drifting along the current until i washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. i insulted people, i hurt people, i did things i regret. i think i may have caused that close friend's cat to die. i had some sort of other person or personality take the wheel for a few days. it's all kind of a blur.  but eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. she took me hiking. i saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. i had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than chinese or dominos delivery. we got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that i'd still been holding onto out of denial. we wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. she took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. she did a one-woman barn raising.  she left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  i didn't.  in no time at all, i was just as withdrawn as before. even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   my father showed up one day. i let him in. we started packing my belongings. the movers showed up. we sold my truck. i tried to hold my head high as i said goodbye to my friends one last time.  we'll see you in a few months dude.  it's just a temporary thing. you just need some time to figure yourself out.  i knew it was lies. i knew even then, i wouldn't see these people again. i really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. but i knew this was different. it felt different. because it didn't feel at all.  i drove back to ohio with my dad, and i did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. my mind was swimming and i really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but i knew he was excited so i tried to fake it for him. when we finally got to the house, i hugged my mom. she was so happy to see me. so relieved. it's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. i took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  and i sobbed. i sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. this was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but i knew deep in my core that it was the end. i looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that i was already dead.  that was early march. here we are, nearing the middle of july. i still tried, to be honest. i tried, despite having no desire to do so. i tried to find solace in my family and i tried to rekindle my love for music. i joined a band. i started posting my own solo projects online. the band thinks i'm great, and the solo stuff i've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  and none of that matters.  i've never thought to myself the world would be a better place without me. no, i'm fully aware that i bring joy and light into peoples' lives. i'm funny. i'm talented. i'm smart. i'm not half bad looking, either, when i take care of myself. honest, i know all of that. i just...i don't \*care\*. i'm so exhausted. i'm so done. it's going to be in the next day or so. there are train tracks not too far from my house...i'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until i can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. i can't fight anymore. i can't keep living life where i cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. i can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. i'm exhausted. i'm all out of fight.  this sandwich doesn't taste good.
on having no friends in your 20s
the schedule is always the same: you work 55 hours each week and work out 15 more. you eat takeout at your desk. you stare – blankly – at others from whom you feel depersonalized and disassociated. they stare back. they glare back. they retch and recoil. you go home and eat more takeout and stare some more – at the wall, at the ceiling, out the window. you watch the world turn. you regret. you speak to yourself and diagnose yourself and add and subtract and divide and grind your teeth and lament and-nothing changes. you stare down and seek reprieve in the rug. you hug your knees and smoke a hundred cigarettes. you exercise again and read a little. you return to work and lie about your weekend plans and your mental health. you hope and dash those hopes. you wait and pray. you shower too long. you eat too little. you never sleep.you resolve. you plot. you choose the tools. you cradle them and know you can end it in minutes. you cower and retreat, and it comes in waves and you attempt again but flee again too. you cannot tell anyone. you cannot hug anyone. there’s no one to hug.your parents and grandparents age. they inquire ceaselessly after your condition. you lie again. you say things are fine, the social life survives, you enjoy work. you enjoy nothing. you drink. you smoke. you masturbate. you cry some more.nothing changes. spring fills fragrant the air and summer brings its heavy trod. the autumn wind bites and the weeks stretch on. the days grow longer then shorter again. the walk is the same. the work is the same. the nights are the same. the sun and moon and stars and horizon are the same. you are the same.nothing changes.
nobody fucking cares before you have actually done it
but then, it's too late to care anyways. care for one fucking time, ignorant dicks

##edit:  june 11, 2012:  we're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending pms inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  thanks!##if you get a pm that looks official, encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to painless suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch)**.  please **include the reddit account** that the pm came from.  this person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our ops with pms that appear to come from us at sw,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  *******if you get one of these pms, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       he's** ***using you*** **to target /r/suicidewatch.*******despite what the pms claim, please be assured of the following:* the sw moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  we more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   the troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the ops were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the sw moderators.* calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   it's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  the troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  this is completely false.   a rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  they only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  * in almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  that means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  however, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  if you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (and it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)* the pm claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the painless methods.   this is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=rst4hnnkowkc), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.*  the troll is also subverting the mission and intent of exit international.  their peaceful pill handbook, which the pm links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  it's very important that you report any pms of this nature.  please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the pms, or defend the troll's actions.  
we euthanize pets when we think they have no more quality of life left and it’s deemed the “responsible” thing to do. but when a human knows their life and that they have no hope left, suddenly everyone becomes the expert on “suicide is selfish and there’s a chance things will get better”
i don’t want to live out the next 50-60 years of my natural lifespan in pain waiting for the day to come so i just want to take matters into my own hands now and save myself the suffering. i don’t need judged and told to hold on because things “might” improve. my life has had 17 years in it. plenty of time to live it and know it’s never going to get any better. if things were ever going to get better and my life was going to improve then it would’ve happened by now
i hate that you can’t be open about wanting to kill yourself because then people just put you on an involuntary hold and make things worse. goddamn i want to die

not today
i talked to her. she doesn't want me anymore. she said she wants eternal peace. was planning to give her that kind of peace. i talked to her mom, who i considered a mother.  she tried to talk me out of it. i still drove to the mountains and was planning to drive the car to a cliff. someone called me, a friend. she asked how my day went and i cried and told him everything.... i just came home from the mountains... not today..
holy shit dude i remember thinking how bizarre the idea of suicide was back when i was a kid and now im here longing it more than ever :/
for me being suicidal feels too normal now if im not suicidal i find ways to make myself fall back again this is plain awful
i just tried to call a couple of suicide prevention hotlines
and they were so busy that i was placed on hold, or asked to leave a message for a call back.i have been seriously planning to kill myself today - i have enough sedatives for a lethal dose, and i’ve had a bottle of wine to myself genuinely planning to eat the lot, but i’ve been fighting the urge all day and i finally tried to call someone.the fact that the lines were so busy made me realise i’m not alone - there must be countless people trying to call my country’s helplines and somehow it’s oddly comforting to know that the reason i can’t get through to someone is because so many other people are right on the edge.i’ll keep trying to get through because i need someone to tell me i have a reason to keep living, but i just wanted to say that it was eye opening to realise so many people are in the same situation. it’s not like resenting people being in front of the queue at the supermarket. there may be someone out there with their wrists open and bleeding out, whilst i am just very close to acting. who am i to take their place in the queue?i guess it’s just strangely helpful to know that there are so many people feeling the same way i do.love and well wishes to anyone reading this.  
my new year's resolution is to work up the courage to commit suicide
27/male/worthless
today i made it to 21
i made promises to myself that i would not make it to see today. but after 3 suicide attempts, 4 psychiatrists, 2 weeks in hospital, and four different mental health diagnoses (and that’s just over the last year) i am finally doing well and would consider myself healthy. i don’t constantly want to be dead anymore. it took work but things can get better. please keep trying!
update on the warning about pms from koko (/u/itskokobot). **please continue to report any sightings.**
[original sticky post from december here](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/5jin1q/warning_if_you_get_a_pm_from_uitskokobot_please/).   koko is a chatbot application that claims to be able to identify people in crisis and also do ai-based therapy with them.  the koko team had had some conversations with some reddit staff members, but then turned on their bot here (reddit account /u/itskokobot) prematurely and without proper communication.   based on the sw/depression mod teams' investigation, we don't recommend this service as either safe or effective. the reddit community team has been keeping us informed as this situation has unfolded, but we haven't had any definitive news to report to you until now.  the bottom line is that:##although a possible collaboration between reddit and [koko](http://itskoko.com) was being considered, reddit's community team has requested that koko's team disengage from further discussions and work on reddit.##**please continue to report any private messaging or other activity that appears to be related to the koko bot.**edits:  fixed oopsie in link, added some background.  
april 2017 i would hold a loaded revolver to my head nearly every day and try to work up the courage to pull the trigger. if i could go back in time, i’d tell myself to do it. nothing ever gets better.

they found him
my ex boyfriend of 5 years and best friend of 6 killed himself about a week ago and they just found his body in the woods. i feel like everything i touch dies, this is my third friend who has killed themselves. i can’t even begin to figure out how to process this. i’d used to call him on my bad nights and he’d talk me down and he promised he’d be here and alive as long as i was. i feel like it’s my fault, i feel such an immense amount of guilt for neglecting him in his final week, almost taunting him. i can’t stop crying unless i turn back to substances but i know he wouldn’t want it like this. i can’t help. those five fucking words destroyed me.[they found him.  he’s gone.](https://imgur.com/a/gz27ppe)
does anyone else feel suicidal but still obliged to try to help others in the same situation?
i can’t bear to think of someone else doing it but for me i want to edit: wow... shocked to see how many people feel the same way i do. just wanted to say thanks for all the replies and kind words
valentines day, the perfect day for me to kill myself
i've been stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety-depression-loneliness for over 4 years now. for the past 2 years i've had pretty much daily suicidal thought, i wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day i'm gonna hang myself.i'm 21 and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way. i have zero confidence, i haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure i am. got a horrible relationship with my parents. i don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me. losing touch with my only few friends. been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when i was about 9. i've never even kissed a girl and now it's too late for me. i'm hopeless cause i'm too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone. i'm skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will.love only gives me negative feelings. it makes me anxious, panicky, makes me realize i'm not good enough. all the stuff i haven't done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore. for the past months, despite trying to surpress it, i've been falling in love with the only female colleague i have a pretty good connection with but she's rediculously far out of my league, quit a lot older and will leave soon so it's another heartbreak either way. better end it before yet another all time low. i have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal. so hopefully 14/02 will be the last day of my useless insignificant existance.thanks for your interest i've you've been reading untill this point.
does anyone else dream/hope of dying in their sleep?

my wife fucked 4 men
my wife just told me that for the past 6 months she has solicited sex via tinder. i want to die.
every night i wish i would die in my sleep
but i'm still here
does anyone else find that the fear of what’s on the other side keeps you from killing yourself but somehow that makes you more depressed?
i just feel like that survival instinct that kicks in just makes everything ten times worse. and people who say well that’s a sign that you shouldn’t do it don’t get how that isn’t it at all. i’m already not human i’ve already lost my mind i have nothing left. like it just feels like torture.
i didn't ask to be born, but i'm here and i'm forced to function and work on a world that i objectively hate. what do i do about this?
obviously, nobody asks to be born into this world. i certainly didn't, but here i am at 24 years old. simply put, i objectively dislike the world and society. i didn't ask to have to need participate in society and  to work in order to pay for food, shelter, etc., but of course most people will just say i'm lazy for not wanting to work. can they really just not wrap their heads around that concept? how can i get over this involuntary existence without deep downbeing miserable every second of my life until i die? again. i did not ask to be a part of this, but since i'm here i have no choice other than to work and he miserable until i die. i feel so stuck and i also feel that i've never actually heard a real answer to these feelings other than well duh nobody asks to be born just get over it. what the fuck do i do with that?
crippling loneliness
i feel as if none of my friends actually like me. i hate my family. all i do is sleep. there's no fucking point.
i should have killed myself in 8th grade when i had the chance.
who ever said it gets better is a fucking liar. fuck you. im done. 
i need help... but i don't know what kind.
i’m just putting this out there because reddit seems to be the only place i can talk freely.        i am so lost i don’t even know how to explain it.        when i lost the only guy i had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. i never recovered from that. all the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     i kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. just enough to stay afloat. for a while i could live off that.     but then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     it’s not that i couldn’t do more – i was, and am, capable. it’s just not in me. i have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. i fear waking up, and cry every morning when i do.    i am not pining for some guy anymore. i don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like i’m completely empty. i just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. it’s like everything that i was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    i have, technically, a boyfriend. but he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. when i try to tell him how hopeless i feel… if i dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. a locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. nothing ever changes. nothing gets better.     and everything just keeps getting worse.        now, i can’t make this month’s rent.         i was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. not because of a boyfriend i am so indifferent to that i can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that i might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if i do go home, even if i do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.        i have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. i have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. the pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. guns aren’t available in this country. i have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. perhaps the best option i have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. i heard you just go to sleep.        but i know that i didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and i haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason i am here typing this long, long note out. so something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. i don’t know what to do.         ...i think that when i wake up tomorrow morning, if i don't feel any better, i will just go ahead and jump. the station is only a five minute walk through the park. it only gets worse from here, anyways.                      **edit:** when i woke up this morning, the first thing i did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. and i burst into tears. seriously. i have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as i do here. i found people to talk to, people who understand, people who sympathize, people who listen, people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any i have felt in years. there are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief i feel. it's like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out.            since i'm not really sure what to think and how to react, it has helped so much to read your messages. i will prepare something, some kind of *ongaeshi*, i will post it up soon!          once again.....    thank you for caring about me.
i just want to know how to leave without making my mom sad.
how is it, that i’m so young with so much life ahead of me, yet i feel so fucking trapped. i feel like i’m under water so deep and when my fingertips finally touch the surface i’m pulled back down. i don’t see myself graduating, i don’t see myself getting married, i don’t see myself giving birth, i don’t see myself in the future. i just want to know how to leave without making my mom sad.edit: i am still here. my life has took a turn and has changed me. i look at life so much more positive now. if your scrolling deep down into this subreddit right now please read. if you are struggling, or relate to the past me^ please, know that no matter what anyone tells you, you are enough to stay on this earth. no matter what you go through, or how sad or depressed or suicidal you are right now, give yourself a break for a day, realize that you are only human and that you don’t have to meet anyones expectations. go at your own pace, you’re here for a long life, take it slow. things will (eventually) get better. go talk to your dogs, your cats, your fish, your mom/dad/sister/brother/grandma/grandpa/cousin/aunt/uncle, anyone who brings you a good laugh, and if you don’t have many of those people talk to me.  in conclusion, your mom will be sad. so please take into consideration that you’re worth every breathable second in this world. <3
those cheesy suicide prevention poems
go onto any youtube video, or anything that is related to suicide, and you’ll get people who say something along the lines of this chessy ass tumblr shit.“your skin isn’t paper, don’t cut it. your life isn’t a film, don’t end it. your face isn’t a mask, don’t hide it. your size isn’t a book, don’t judge it. don’t kill yourself, people out there care about you.”fuck off, we all know whoever came up with this quote don’t even know what depression is like and just made it up on tumblr to get likes. if you did know what depression is like, you wouldn’t say that cheesy hollywood bullshit. it’s sad too, because i saw a video of a kid who committed suicide, and the whole comment section was copied-and-pasted-filled with the same exact verse. if i was the kid who killed himself, and i was still alive somehow, i’d feel disrespected as fuck that all of these people are pretending to feel bad for me and sharing those cheesy ass rhymes. bullshit.
anyone else get super depressed around the holidays and just want to say fuck it and end things? feeling that way now!
i suffer from depression, clearly. however, this holiday season i have been feeling it extra hard, and i don't know why. i have tried to do everything i can to cheer myself up. i've gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones, even wrapping them nicely (not an easy feat for a klutz like me), was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews. tried dressing a lot nicer at work. figured fake it until i make it. it's worked in the past. but last night i found myself driving to my local gun store, about 30 minutes from me, and looking at guns to buy. i used to have a decent sized collection / cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations. then over time i would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck. i don't have any more. i bought a kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldn't do it. just ending up cutting a little. however, last night i found myself wanting to buy a gun. however, with me as someone who likes guns i want the gun to have meaning. isn't that fucked up? like almost anyone will do, but i wanted something specific. found one that was almost exactly what i wanted and priorly owned, but didn't end up purchasing it. instead i drove around for a bit and just meditated. although i am debating going back there today, getting that gun, driving to some scenic place and redecorating the interior of my car... i hate hurting people. i have seen what suicide has done to people. my best friend killed himself while drunk almost 5 years ago. it tore everything apart. my girlfriend's brother killed himself shortly before thanksgiving and it has torn her apart. i have tried being there for her but of course keeping my feelings down. i also fear what does or doesn't come next. i most likely won't do shit, as i am a coward and i care too much, but damn do i want to just end my suffering...
fuck girlfriends i just want a friend
people always talk on here about being lonely and wanting a girlfriend but i honestly couldn't care less, i just want a friend. a single one. when you think about it, love is kind of selfish... the idea of wanting one person all to yourself *forever* is kind of psychotic. with friends however you can maintain a healthy distance but still enjoy each others company and also genuinely care about them. anyone else feel the same way?
i've wanted to kill myself for awhile now, but just had my favorite soup

my sister's suicide this week.
i’ve never posted here before, but i thought i’d share my story due to events that happened this week. i am sophia’s younger brother (i have two older sisters, as well), and i am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. this is her reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/humanzucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/humanzucchini)). i was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since i last met her in september 2018, and it’s unfortunate that i was not given the chance to contact her, as i have autism and depression too. i had no idea that she tried to run away before i contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.&#x200b;we had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in august 2018). i genuinely believed she would come home for the easter holidays in a few weeks, as i accepted that she didn’t want to come home for christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. this tragedy has brought the family closer together: i had a heart-to-heart with my father, who i thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; i vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; i promised that if i ever felt like this, i would get in-touch immediately; i contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. i have been taken aback by all the supportive comments i received, even from people i never really spoke to that i assumed didn’t care for me.&#x200b;she was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me i had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. i don’t want the same fate as her, because i feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and i want to change it for the better in my life. aside from the times that we fell-out, i tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. i gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; i asked if she wanted to play smash bros. (i tried to teach her how to play, and i remember the time that i had a 300% handicap and still won); i asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (steven universe, invader zim, star vs. the forces of evil, etc.). i respected her decision to focus on her studies (i would have done the same), and i thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.&#x200b;whenever the funeral service is planned, i intend to sing ‘love like you’ (the credits theme from steven universe), in-front of all the attendees. she couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. i remember she was listening to ‘stronger than you’ and ‘dear old dad’ whilst studying at home. thank you for all the memories, and i won’t let you down.&#x200b;i posted this here, as she posted on this subreddit this month, and i want to help and talk to people who feel this way, because i have felt like this before. i also posted this on suicide bereavement. 
thank you
i dont know if this post breaks the rules, but ill try my luck with it. i just want to say thank you to every wonderful human being who adds to this subreddit. as someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts forever, finding this community has been amazing. one of the worst feelings ive ever had was being completely and utterly alone. i cant even imagine how much easier my struggles would have been with awesome, compassionate, empathetic people like you. please know that you help so much. thank you. 
i just need a hug
that's all i need, a 20 min hug from someone who needs it back. 
don't take the pills... it hurts
so i don't think this will stop people from ending their but maybe it will make someone rethink it. today i tried to overdosed on 1000mg of antidepressants, at about 8:30pm i took ten pills and waited.now obviously, i didn't die. but it feels like i am. after about an hour i got dozy, had a hard time keeping my head up and stuff. i wasn't scared, i wasn't sad i was just so groggy. ten minutes after that my stomach began to ache.for half an hour i threw up stomach acid violently. i felt like i was going to pass out, so i went to my room to lay down, hell i should've gone to a hospital. the dizziness got worse and i was gagging constantly. i couldnt lay down without hurting, i couldnt sit up without falling down and standing up out of the question. even now, almost four hours later my body is in small spasms and i'm having a hard time just typing because my body is shaking uncontrollably.my head still hurts and i cant focus on much, im exhausted and i cant sleep. this isnt fun, i wish that i didnt do this honestly. i wish i didnt try like this. so if you read this and youre thinking of ending your life with pills, just give it a second thought because its not a painless death.
i woke up
i woke up this morning, and the moment i opened my eyes and understood that i was awake i started crying.if that's not a sign then i don't know what is.
“if you feel suicidal, call the suicide hotline or 911”
i can’t deal with constantly hearing and seeing this. once, a long time ago, i called the suicide hotline and then they sent a ton of police to my house. now i can’t drive for fear of getting pulled over by the police and getting triggered. i hate hearing it all the time, it’s just a lie. they aren’t going to help me, they’re going to send police to my house who will take me to a hospital and lock me in and then send me a bill that i can’t afford. i wish i could actually talk to the suicide hotline people without a legitimate fear of being locked up in inpatient.
so i listen to music to calm myself and to numb down my suicidal thoughts for a bit, is this weird or do other people do it too and btw i usually listen to iamjakehill’s suicidal thoughts song look it up on youtube/spotify if you’re curious and this sub honestly makes me feel at home thank you
have a nice day:)
i've finally hit my limit
i've been steadily getting worse over the past six months. no amount of medication seems to be helping, and i can't for the life of me seem to be able to get into counselling.finally got some respite in a small holiday for a wedding, and when it came to it i freaked out and missed the entire ceremony, set of the alarm to the villa and ruined everything. the reception is happening as i type this.now i'm just in bed absolutely dreading having to face everyone again. i've no handle on my anxiety and i've no idea where to even begin. i'm sick of fucking up absolutely everything. i can't do this anymore. i feel so ridiculous for being set off by this one little thing, but i've hit my limit. i plan on killing myself the night we get the plane back home. eeeh, thanks for letting me rant i guess. see you on the other side
my best friend and partner in crime just committed suicide, i'm going to join her this evening.
my entire world has gone from shitty but bearable to just 'gone' in the last two months. i had to put my schoolyear on hold because i got diagnosed with depression, got put on antidepressants, my parents consider me a failure but throughout all that, i had one light, one rock to lean on. i would always look forward to doing stuff with her and now she's gone, just like that... she even made me a promise that she would wait but i get that she couldn't wait for me. that's ok, i have 80 clonazolams, some flunitrazolam and some trazodone that i will take this evening with some drinks so if it doesn't kill me it will knock me out nice and long so i wont have to deal with reality for a bit.
have you ever just extremely regretted all your choices that have led you up to this point? and the fact you can’t go back on those choices?

dad's friends raped me.
i feel paralyzed. i barely had enough energy to open up the computer. i don’t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light. i’d been in the shower for almost an hour and i just can’t get it out. it’s crippling me and i’m helpless. i have no one else to tell this and i just want to kill myself. i just want the pain to end.i feel so much hate and anger but i can’t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them; even you dad. i hate you so much for letting them do this to me. i hate you so much for doing absolutely *nothing* while they raped me. is that what friends do dad?; getting you drunk and raping your daughter? none of this would’ve happened if mom was still here. she would’ve stopped them. it hurt so much i thought they were going to kill me. now i wish they had.you changed a lot after her death. you stopped asking how my day was. you stopped coming to pick me up from school. all my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but i only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. that’s how much i love you. do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you’d do for me? you only had to show a little of it dad. you only had to stay sober. you only had to remember that i’m always here for you. but no, you chose the bottle over me. and i didn’t mind cleaning up after you. i didn’t mind when you talked harsh to me even though it hurt like hell. it’s the demons you brought in with you. you let them take control of you. you let them hurt me. but i still love you dad. i always will. maybe when i’m gone i could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to.i needed to tell all of this to you dad. i needed to cry on your shoulders one last time but i don’t have the courage and you don’t have your mind. i hope it’s not you who finds me. sweet dreams dad. remember me and please forgive me.
kinda wish i could just restart as a different person
there's no extremely traumatic event that happened in my life, just unhealthy people propagating and creating more unhealthy people like me. i don't want to die, but i don't want to live this particular life either
dying tomorrow or 60 years from now, what does it matter the end result is still the same why bother enduring 60 years of a shitty life when you can just end it?

i'm the worst doctor in the whole world
i can't do anything right. academically i faceplanted my way through school. socially i can't even get a girl to hold my hand. even michael rotondo that 30-year-old basement dweller guy had a exwife and son.if nothing else medical school gave me the necessary information on how to go out peacefully. was it worth $200,000? i don't know but luckily after this evening i won't have to ponder it anymore.if someone finds this from my browsing history: i'm sorry to mom and dad and i (first name initial, you know who you are). if it helps, i was going to kill myself earlier but wanted to wait till graduation so at least you can know your son accomplished something in life. please use that to comfort you in the dark times ahead. i'm in a better place now.
being “fine” or “numb” but you still wanna die is the worst
when you can have a good day or be feeling alright but still wanna be six feet under
i was wrong
i hate when people say to think of how much pain you'll cause others. they'll get over it, i always think. i'm just a burden anyway. they'll be sad for awhile, but better off in the long run.yesterday i intended to kill myself. my ex/roommate (it's complicated) caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me. when my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me. she was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong, but i could feel her whole body shaking.she sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular. just talked, joked, and laughed like we do. but even half an hour later i could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine. she was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me, but inside she was a wreck. later, when i went up to our room to sleep, she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow. it was such a small gesture, but it  made me feel loved.i knew she would be sad, but i still underestimated how much she cared. i don't know if i'll ever forget that feeling. i don't think i should.i wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like i do. i was wrong. you might be too. there are plenty of people in my life who have turned out to not care at all when i thought they did. there's at least one who cares a whole lot more than i gave her credit for. 
i wish...
...i could donate my lifetime to somebody that is in need of it. like young people suffering from deadly diseases or something. they want to live but can't, i don't want to live but can. would be the perfect swap.
i wish life had checkpoints or a reset button
2018 has been absolutely horrible for me. i feel like i've ruined every connection to people i had. it feels like everyone hates me. i have a severe lack of trust in people that over and over again gets proven justified. i barely sleep at all or i sleep too much. i cry every day multiple times but most of the time it's for no reason at all or it's because my life is just so sad. i can barely function at work. i've been struggling with food for the last few months where i can't seem to eat normally. it's either eat way too much or i go at least a day without eating. i keep planning to do things like go for a walk or go see a movie by myself but i fail every time.i wish it would just stop but i feel like i have absolutely no control over what happens in my life and there's no way to change it. 
i want to die so bad
i want to die so bad. i'm tired of being alone, i'm tired of feeling worthless, self loathing, i'm just tired. i'm tired of people taking me for granted, i'm tired of watching people fuck up after i put in effort to help them. i feel so undervalued.i hate myself...i want to kill myself...
why are people acting like it's always irrational when somebody wants to die?
i have no friends, no social (or any) skills, no job or any normal basic experiences. i don't fit in anywhere and i can't function in society. it makes sense in my situation that i want to die. i believe almost everyone would feel the same if they eyperienced the same things. i don't feel human anymore. objectively it would be better if i didn't exist. i just keep suffering and it's exhausting and tiring.
nothing makes me want to puke quite like it gets better

i'm so sick of this find a job you love bullshit
there's not a single job i can think of that doesn't sound like 100% misery, i don't even want to be alive, yet i'm forced not only to be here, but to pay for it
anyone just living life like im gonna end up killing myself anyway
and sometimes when things get better u already fucked up ur life so bad?? so like might as well just kill myself??
i feel like the struggles of young adults and teens on this sub aren't treated as seriously because they are young.
i've seen many people here see someones age being under 25 or so and just downplay their feelings because they have a lot of time to fix it. i see it especially with teens. many people simply say to give it time, your angsty, your horomones are raging, etc... and i wont deny that certainly plays a part in it. however, i think it's dangerous to put all teens under this blanket, as many are truly suffering from issues that cant be fixed by simply becoming an adult. someone looking for support here doesnt want to have their feelings downplayed and ignored, regardless of the cause of them.
how i found my older brother commited suicide
i am 26 years old right now, and not a day goes by where i don't think about my older brother. people used to ask me when i was a kid if i had any siblings and i would always point to my older brother and say he's my brother. now i just say i'm an only child and leave it at that. half of my friends don't know i had a brother, because i don't want to mention it. well, here goes the story that i never told anyone before. me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod. we used to do everything together. play sports, watch movies, and like other brothers, we used to fight. but with every fight, we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other. i used to say rude things to him, i used to call him a jerk and a mean person, but i never really meant it. so my brother was 18 years old when he was dead. i remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide, and he was complaining about something to dad, that i never really know what until i later realized it was about anxiety. he taught me how to make something called paper airplanes, where you got paper and made them into airplanes. it was fun, i used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far it would land, and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning. every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when i was just waking up. sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other.so one day, i woke up. i looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room. i guess i slept longer than him, but i never do. he usually wakes up at like 7 am in the morning. i checked the time and it was 11 am. i made a paper airplane and threw it at his room. he would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when i did but no one came out the room. i opened the door fully and he wasn't in his bed. that's when i looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of, it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was. i saw the closet was mildly open and that's when i saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day. i saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed, and his face with a pale expression, almost like a frown. i remember his skin color looked odd. i thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller. i saw something was holding him up and then i saw the little rope by his throat holding him up. i didn't know what he was doing, i thought it was a prank he made to scare me. i touched his chest and then pushed him. i then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad. by then tears were on my eyes.but i can tell you right now, if i had to choose something that tore me apart more... my brother's lifeless body or my parents reaction to it, i would have chose parents reaction. my dad came into the room, followed by my mom, and for some reason i just didn't want to be in that room anymore and i let myself out to the hallway. then i heard screaming of my brother's name from my mom, and then some type of noise. i think it was my dad pushing my brother's body, like me. they started sobbing. i went to peek back in the room and then i saw my dad shaking and whimpering. he was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me, my brother, and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop. my mom was just standing there with her lips quivering... her teeth shaking, and her eyes were red. i didn't notice it but i was crying too. my whole body was shaking. i ripped up all my paper in my room and i felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides, i then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours. i never wanted to leave the room, and all i could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that i was in. i tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself, i used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up, i scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but i never woke up. i never woke up.every night now, i always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now, and if he would have had a family by now. every year on the day of my brother's death, i throw a paper airplane to a river, and every day i would hope to wake up in my room with a paper airplane lying in my bed, from my older brother. that's the story of my brother's suicide. 
i was contemplating on ending myself today, but i found the motivation to keep going in the most unusual and shallow circumstances.
i’m latino, that’s something important to mention.anyway a family friend had just died, and they did a crap photoshopped a picture of him on his bike in the sky with angel wings and a halo. that was so tacky, omg. if i’m even younger than him, they will make it even more tacky. i refuse to de disrespected that way. i have decided to outlive all my family.
to therapists or anyone who says suicide is taking the easy way out vs working to make things better, fuck you all

does anyone else wanna die but doesn’t have the guts to kill themselves
i just want to get hit by a car on the way to school i feel like my life is so worthless. tryna find a reason to live is so hard 
why is suicide looked down upon but mental health is often overlooked during the entire buildup?
what's the point of going on when you lost everything? no family anymore, no gf anymore, no joy in life anymore, no pursuit of knowledge, due to depression confiding you to a bed, no bettering of yourself through exercise due to debilitating monotony of earning a paycheck bi-weekly while executives earn 10-100x your salary for your menial work.i read that alan turing, who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during world war 2, was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay. his hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life, his thirst for knowledge, and eventually made him take his own life. was he weak? no, but defeated, chemically and without purpose.we're told suicide is selfish. but if it is so selfish, why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone? where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks-months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support?nobody wants to hear your problems. if you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while. life's short, you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck. people will always remember your wins, but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized. then you ask yourself am i doing enough, is it worth bringing up, or is the harsh reality that nobody really cares until the decision is made?
how can't people be depressed
seeing how fucked up and selfish humanity is?i just can't bare when i point out animal cruelity  or wage slavery or bullshit in religion or bullshit of politics and non depressed people are like whatever... what can you do... focus on being productive.oh yea, productivity i love that word, it keeps sheeple in a fucking line... just obey your 33 loving  overlords and then you will get a cookie and a paycheck to paycheck life. 
it's time. goodbye reddit.
i am currently driving to visit my grandmothers grave for one last time. then i will attempt to od, if i fail then i will give an update. if i don't update then i am either dead or in the hospital. i just thought i should update those that have tried to help me. thank you all and please just remember that my mind was already made up. to everyone else on this sub reddit. i hope that you all can overcome the difficulties that are trying to bring you down. if not i understand, i am in that place where it will never get better. goodbye. i love you all. 
i tried to ask my family for help, and their answer is god.
im from a third world country, and my entire family is very religious, i'm not. while i respect their choice to belive in something, they dont respect mine. they think that depression is a joke, that it's just an excuse for lazy people. i tried to explain to them how the human body works, but a simple concept like cells and hormones doesnt make sense to them.im alone. im 20, i dont have a job, i dont have friends, and the only joy that i have in this world is to talk with my online friends and that is starting to fade away. i never met my mother and my father ( the only person that tried to help me get out of this hole ) hanged himself 2 years ago, and now i have to hear things like he is going to end like his dad if he doesnt find god.help me internet.
[f17] - feeling numb and lonely as fuck
thanks to my fucking shyness and awkwardness i ended up being seen as a weird and retarted kid since my age of 6, when i started school. parents were so worried about me they forced me to hang around with neighbours that didn't like me that at all. i was neglected and made fun off every since. i also had acne and poor motorics which made me ever more sadder. now i'm in high school and a little progress happened - it seems no one cares about me, i'm in a club, looking better... but scared of future and everything. i have 0 friends, never had a bf, believing i must be very boring and aloof to actually have meaningful relationships. i'm ok with family - but i never told them i want to kill myself. i plan to visit a halloween party at one club alone and if nothing happens i'm gonna overdose. i just wanna feel loved at once.update: omg i didn't expect so many responses to come up that fast... thank you all!
i can't be the only one who started 2019 in tears
i wish i was brave enough to follow through with it. i can't because i don't know what awaits me after that. i can't put my best friend through another suicide funeral. i'm in tears
please kill me in my sleep please kill me in my sleep please kill me in my sleep please kill me in my sleep thanks

i wish i was never alive. i don't want to die, i wish i never existed.

wake up, browse reddit, watch porn, contemplate suicide, repeat
man fuck this shit. people say it gets better, no it gets worse. legitimately considering trying to stab myself in the jugular. i was sexually abused and mutilated and no one cares. people laugh at my problems call me crazy. theres to much contradiction here. hurt me, tell me its no big deal, tell me i'll get over it, laugh at me. either kill me or care for me i can't stand this inbetween flip floppy bull shit. its torture. everyone would be better without me anyway i'm just a problem generator. it hurts so much. if theres a god he knows no mercy.edit fuck, man i need some weed. i need some love. maybe i'll find some at the bottom of the river
my sister told me to kill myself
my sister and i used to be best friends. but i noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a grudge against me. she got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. i tried to connect with her because i still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. and because of this, my sister and i haven't spoken to each other in three months.my sister was up at 4:00 am today and i couldn't sleep so i went to her room and told her to go to bed. she started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. as soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.five minutes after that happened, i heard a voice in the dark say, i hate you. i wish you would die. go kill yourself.i realized that it was coming from my sister's room. i got up and said, what? what did you just say?i hate you. i wish you would kill yourself. just die already.i didn't know why she was saying this, so i started crying and went downstairs. my heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.i told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. my dad stayed with me, and held me as i cried. he said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.she never did. in fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. she pretended that i didn't even exist. she was happy.the worst part, was how my sister *knew* i was suicidal. back when she was nice, i told her about my feelings and how i wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. now, she shames me because of it. she shames me for being depressed and tells me that i was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. she told me that i was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. she told me that she hated me everyday.this morning, i tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but i failed.now i have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.edit- part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/cgh5nz/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/cgh5nz/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself_part_2/)
i don't think life sucks, i just genuinely believe living isn't for everyone
grew up in a household with parents passively hating eachother for the past 12 years openly in front of me and my siblings but won't divorce because they can't do well financially on their own. would often talk bad about the other to us and would use us to communicate when they wouldnt want to talk to eachother. did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and i started having anxiety and panic attacks. i couldn't focus anymore and started giving up on school, stopped doing all activities i used to love and harmed myself. started having suicidal thoughts and a year after i attempted. felt a little better after some hospitalization, but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments.was suicidal again but somehow got a great boyfriend. i've been so happy with him these past months. but with him only. i was just as depressed and suicidal as i was before, except when i was spending time with him. i don't have any goals in life anymore, i can't go to college and i work minimum wage. also, i'm really sensitive about what's going on in the world and it makes me loose hope for humanity. i don't think life sucks, i genuinely just believe living isn't for everyone. some people are able to make the most of it and find happiness, but some just don't have the right mentally and tools and it should be okay for them to leave if that's what makes them happy. it hurts to have someone you love die, i understand that, but what good does it make to try and keep someone who isn't happy and won't be happy in the future and let them suffer for years to come? wouldn't that hurt? also before you guys mention my boyfriend, yeah i love him, but love never really lasts. and at this point, i'm so sensitive that if we ever have a fight or go through a rough time, i would definitely break and kill myself, cause he's pretty much the only thing that still makes me genuinely happy. and i can't imagine how bad it would be if i left that way, i don't want him to blame himself, he doesn't deserve that. i would rather leave when we're still on great terms.
3 weeks ago i attempted suicide and no one knows
november 23, 2019 i attempted suicide. i have not told anyone, or very little people. i tried to hang myself due to a broken heart and stress. after the attempt i started to view the world around me differently and see that maybe i am wanted.... i haven't really felt the need to take my life after that as i met a guy whom i like a lot. the work day after my suicide attempt was different, i noticed people actually seemed to care. or, i saw some accomplishment in myself. i yet to seek help for my mental issues, but so far im trying to figure things out.
does anyone feel like a functioning suicidal?
i feel like i could end it all at any second and get some relief. but i also go through the motions of life like i'm planning to live for so much longer. i go to class for the most part, eat food, try to look groomed on the outside. in a way, i feel like people can't take me seriously. all my so called friends just look at me like there's nothing wrong with me. even though i tell them things, it's like the end of the day i look okay on paper, so i must be okay. my parents know i feel like this but they already have my life planned out and i feel trapped. it's been a constant trend in my life where even if i tell people i'm struggling, no one believes me. i think that's part of what has driven me to this point because no one wants to help. i don't know if i'm the only one who feels this way edit: i'm honestly surprised at how much attention this has gotten. i just want you all to know that your feelings and thoughts are valid no matter what and should be treated as such. there's still a lot of stigma about mental health in general but i fully believe everyone is entitled to treatment and a therapist who will sympathetically listen to their problems no matter what. none of you deserve anything less than that. i've tried my best to respond to all the people who responded but my inbox is always open to messages if anyone wants to say anything. thank you guys so much for making me feel like this isn't so abnormal
i stay alive because i’m guilted into remaining on this earth to avoid causing pain to my loved ones.
i wish i had the inner strength to actually follow through on my plan - take a greyhound bus to a different state and and kill myself there. no one would be able to identify me, i would be a jane doe and my loved ones would just think i got kidnapped or something. 
is there anyone else struggling today?
or is it just me?
relationships are temporary, be it friendship or romantic relationships. i feel so alone and i can’t grasp / hold on to anything because they always just go away at the end. it’s so painful to live i don’t wanna see another day. i feel like i’m living inside a game that i can’t quit.
we are all alone, you are either aware of it or you are not. 
not expecting much from here. even the crisis hotline counselor was speechless
i just need to vent.i'm a single gay man in my late 30's. seen multiple mental health professionals over the years. been there, done that. have a couple of college degrees. i don't drink or do drugs.i always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment. i found myself working with autistic children and public service which i liked, but it's not a stable job. i had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation (not important what). realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over, i quickly landed a job in corporate america.then i was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the da, i got five years probation and two suspended sentence. i was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew - my job, my neighbors, my family. a year into probation, i got violated for having a bullet. ironically, i had purchased a gun in case i was facing serious time. so i went to prison for two years. it was awful. there was nothing rehabilitative about it. while everyone talked about getting high once they got out, i talked about getting a job.i was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood. i found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check. a year later, it went out of business. i said fuck it and started applying for those high-paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check. it worked. i landed the highest-paying job i ever got. with health insurance too. it was a lot of work, but worth it.lately i had been feeling suicidal. burned out. anxious. overwhelmed. the one thing that kept me going was my job. it took up most of my time and gave me financial peace (which is underrated).then i got fired today.not sure what happened, but three months into the job and passing my background check, they fired me for lying. it's beyond me how they found out. i think a co-worker found out and dropped a dime on me. i was a good worker. i left feeling ashamed, degraded, defeated, etc. i can't do this again. it's not like there was good jobs for a middle-age felon. that's a lie. been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didn't and couldn't help. it had to be up to me.to keep on trying to make it is senseless. it's insanity.i called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor. he was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days. i wasn't expecting anything.i think he understood. killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years.i've been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief. i thought about killing myself only after my mom dies, but truth be told i have been and am in too much pain and it's not fair to me. i'd rather die and leave my savings to her. i feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something (they couldn't or wouldn't).there is this part of me that fears death less. what i fear is my future. at least death is inevitable.again, not expecting anything life changing on here. the next few days will be brutal. i have crossed a point of no return today.&#x200b;edit: i spent the better part of the weekend getting high off my ass, binge eating and sleeping. i looked in the mirror and look like shit. my apartment is a wreck. i thought to myself what my next step is and all of them were tying up loose ends. it's just too complicated, high-risk low-reward, expensive, much pressure, etc. to move on with life. it takes up too much of my life and i was already dealing with too much and i don't have the energy to do it anymore. people like me who choose life under these circumstances end up going back to prison and/or on the streets. i'd rather die.
i got into a car accident this morning and my last thought before impact was “i hope this kills me”.
i hit my head and likely have a concussion. i’ve had headaches and slight dizziness all day. can’t afford the doctors bills, and it’s the end of the year so it’s not like paying towards my deductible would do any good. so, may as well say fuck it, hope that i die in my sleep, and let it be. suicide to me has become similar to the ending of batman begins. “i won’t kill you, but i don’t have to save you.” so bring on the tobacco, liquor, or whatever. let it be “stoicistic suicide”.
how many times do i have to google i want to kill myself before i actually do it?

took the pills, drink the beer, get cold and post on reddit before i die.
been putting off killing myself, but i took the pills (benzos and opiates and can depressant meds) this time, drank some beer to kick it all into gear... fingers and legs are getting very cold... i just wanted to say goodbye to everyone here... you all tried your bestedit: added some more meds to make sure it does the trick. just so done---dec 8th, 2018i am so sorry to all of you! i did end up overdosing, but not enough to finish the job. i ended up getting really sick though and puking on pretty much everything. i have a traumatic brain injury (childhood abuse and concussions) and so it affected me a ton because of that. i spent the last several days not able to focus my eyes. i would wander around my room like a zombie, not able to comprehend pretty much anything. i am on a ton of meds for other medical stuff and i got really sick from not taking my meds when i was not able to think clearly. i am finally able to read (and comprehend), otherwise, i would have updated you all... i honestly didn't think my post would get any attention, and i remember only bits and pieces of the last several days. i am still not to 100% but no one knows, except for my friend who has also attempted; i didn't want any judgment. i am doing okay, had some si's creep in again but i beat them back. i am still in a daze that i could have died... and i was, and am still, okay with that, but now it feels like life is super surreal... you are all really kind, and seeing this much love from so many strangers has helped me in a significant way
i often fantasize about what others would do if i ended it
i imagine my teachers talking to my classmates about how i was found hanging in my room. i imagine people finally realizing that i wasn't just having a few bad days, that me saying i want to kill myself everyday was real. i imagine the utter sadness and horror people would experience knowing that i'd done it. i feel like i get closer every day. every molecule of my very being is begging for the end, and i don't think i can keep holding them back for long.
i honestly can't come to terms with the fact that i will spend the rest of my life working, for nothing, and that i have no choice but to be a wage slave, it just drains me so much i feel like nothing is worth it

i don't think people really care until you actually die. and even then they might not care
if i make a post on reddit i usually get ignored.even when someone listens to me and responds, they usually ghost me after some time.if i want to talk to a professional, they are only there because of money, because they know that it's their job and they have to do it because if they don't they won't have money to eat.no one really cares
anyone wish they would get hit by a car or bus or get an incurable cancer, instead of the stigma their family would receive from suicide.
i wish i got hit by a car or bus or got some incurable disease to die. i truly wish somebody facing death from a disease could have my body so that they could use it well and develop friends and relationships and spend time with their family and pursue their dreams. trade me please, i know what i would be walking into and wouldn’t regret a thing. i don’t want my family to receive the stigma from my suicide. people will think they have failed me or that our family is broken. it’s not true, it’s me and my fault. people can say you’ll be dead so why would you care. truth is we don’t know for sure what happens after death.
i feel like a robot that the only way to turn my feelings off and put my mind on “numb mode” is by aimlessly watching youtube videos
i wish i was dead
someone saved my life today
i know this is a bit different from what people typically post on this thread but i don’t know who to tell. i don’t want to tell anyone that i was minutes away from killing myself. but that’s exactly what just happened. i’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. things haven’t been easy for me. i’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. all my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and i still had one more to do today. i’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. i recently changed my major to geology from accounting. my mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). my dad is an economics major. they don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. this, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. i’m sort of the black sheep of the family. anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their ssn for my federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill i’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my fafsa application. i tried to get a loan with my bank where i have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. my parents refuse to sign it. i reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and i shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and i go to the same university). i wrote my suicide note and i was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (paxil). everything felt entirely perfect. i was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. but right as i went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. i answer the door (my paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl i’ve seen once or twice around. she says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and i was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. i’m an extrovert so i just feel weird doing stuff alone.” i don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from god. like maybe god or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. after she left i sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off. when i go home i’m going to check into a psych ward and get the help i’ve been procrastinating on getting. i’m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder, and remember what happened tonight. the timing of everything that happened tonight wasn’t a coincidence at all. 
i catch myself wanting to go “home” but not knowing where that even is
i catch myself saying it in a room of people, at work, while driving, while in my bed, while eating in a restaurant. doesn’t matter where. it’s just always playing in my mind. i’ve never really felt at home anywhere, and i hate saying it because of that.
“death is permanent you can’t come back”
it’s amazing to me how many people say this sort of thing to stop someone from wanting to kill themself. don’t you get it? that’s the point. i don’t want to be here. i don’t want to change my mind. do you really think i’m so delusional that i believe i’ll die then decide i could have lived longer and come back? are you really so delusional you don’t see i want to die because it means i won’t be coming back?
psa from the mod team: please don't report posts just because they seem high-risk to you, thanks.
we've had a sudden uptick of anonymous people (or possibly one energetic person) clicking report and specifying something like viable threat of self-harm as the report reason.  we have no idea what the motivation is for these reports, but this is a dangerous and ill-advised practice for the following reasons:1. reporting a post increases the probability that it will be snagged by the reddit spam filter.  this is entirely outside the moderators' control.2. the criteria for these reports seem to be pretty random, and [do not correspond to established, evidence-based risk assessment criteria](http://redd.it/1c7nqf).3.  most of the reported posts have had some good, supportive responses, so there doesn't appear to be any special action warranted on the part of the moderators.  4.  what it says in the sidebar is true - we don't have the resources to trace the source of any post, but we fear that this is what our anonymous reporter is expecting.  so we'd like to point out that outing someone can actually increase the inherent risk in a situation rather than decreasing it, especially in the long term, by discouraging them from opening up about their feelings.  involuntary interventions are almost never necessary, and almost always traumatic.  it's important to remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention.  it saves far more lives than it costs.  the times when outing someone is the safer choice are the rare exceptions, as when someone gets entangled in a safety harness and needs to be cut out of it.  if you think an op needs any kind of special help or intervention from the sw mod team, please [send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch), thanks.  
attempted suicide two years ago. just got facebook timeline and saw something...
i attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.it wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, hey, i'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever. i was unconscious for over 24 hours. my roommate was the only person who knew at the time. i just told him i got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. i had taken three half-full bottles of pills. it was a spur of the moment decision and i had convinced myself that i wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. two days later i could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. i may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.i don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. so i was surprised to find some facebook posts just today.looking back, i posted every day. something. oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. and then, there was a three-day period where i posted nothing. i knew immediately what those three days were. but there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister... brudder! are you alive? :) holy shit.i read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when i was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. i chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. don't be a fucking idiot like i was. if i had killed myself, i would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.if you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.i hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. my sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.**tl;dr - sister jokingly asked if i was still alive after i almost killed myself.**
sometimes i wish something tragic would happen in my life so i have a reason to justify my depression.
it’s fucked up thinking i know but i just got these weird af scenarios in my head and i know it ain’t right. i know i don’t have enough to be sad about even tho i know that’s not how it works.
why do people freak out so much when they find out you want to die?
it’s an honest question. like, it’s hard to believe there are actually people on this planet who think life is worth living. i honestly can't wait until i don't exist anymore...
committing suicide would be selfish, because it's making your loved ones live in pain for the rest of their lives just so you won't have to suffer. uh, so then aren't you pretty selfish for forcing me to live in pain for my entire life just so you won't have to suffer?
sorry for title gore - i'm getting so sick of my being suicidal automatically being attacked with accusations of being selfish, because of how much it will affect the people around me if i did it - which, by the way, is pretty much the only fucking reason i'm still here. i've been suffering for a long time, the only reason i'm putting up with it and haven't just killed myself already is basically for my family. so they won't have to find my body, so i won't leave the couple of friends i have alone, so no one else will have to suffer like i'm being forced to. but no, yeah, i'm the selfish one.i don't want to live anymore. you're the fucking selfish one for forcing me to just for your own fucking happiness when i've been telling you for years that i am not. happy. it hurts. it really hurts. if you truly loved me, you would let me end it.
your kid's mental state is more important than their grades.
i'm fucking tired of adults only fucking worrying about grades it's fucking stupid. (ex: my parents know i'm suicidal, only worry about grades) i don't fucking care about grades if i'm planning on killing myself and i don't think y'all do either. and it just makes it worse for you to say 'you working on you grades?' all the time when im clearly fucking looking like i am wanting to die. but no.  to them that's not fucking important.
i appreciate not killing myself last night. i appreciate all these people being here for me. thank you! always thank you!
omg! so far i could see this. i am really crying now. thank you!thank you for my first gold. thank you.
i've realized why people kill themselves.
since the day i was born, i've always been alone. i've never been able to form a connection with anyone. not even online.and suddenly, it hit me. like a sledgehammer right into my face - **i am completely alone in this world.**even though it may seem liberating or romantic, it isn't. it's the cold hard truth i'll have to face for every day until i die.i don't think i'll be able to bear that burden.
so many people want to die
for the past two years i think i won't be able to recall a day when i woke up or before i went to sleep that i wouldn't think of death.this is my first post on redditactually made an account just for this group. i think it is just sad that so many people are unhappy. myself included.i can't say  don't die cause i want to myself. if it wasn't for my family, i guess i would be soil right now.not really sad. just find life pointless.people piss me off, but at the same time they make me happy and it is essential to hang out with them so we won't get more depressed. almost 660 people are active out of the 1.000.000 something in this group. don't know if they died or stopped thinking about death. i hope they are peaceful either way.
everyone in my family i cared about is dead at 19 and anxiety is making me want to die.
my dad was an alcoholic and killed himself when i was 10. my uncle who was like a father figure to me died of cancer when i was 13. my grandpa who was also like a father figure to me died of a major artery burst when i was 16. my mom was very mentally ill, she attempted suicide many times throughout my life since i was a kid and in some ways she was emotionally abusive to me but i still cared about her and she died of cancer last march, i'm 19. i'm living on my own now and have to pay bills but the problem is i have nearly crippling anxiety which makes it hard to work because almost everytime i go in the whole time i have really bad anxiety and keep having the thought repeat in my head that i'd rather kill myself than continue feeling like this. i've been working for 3 weeks now and almost everyday i've burst into tears while working. for the last month i've spent every day wandering whether or not i should kill myself i really enjoy living and for now i'm too scared to kill myself but anxiety is a cunt.
technically if i did kill myself the problem would be gone

no job, no friends, and family that sees me as a disappointment.
i know these type of posts are seen all the time so i don’t expect a lot of interaction with mine. i just need a place to vent since i really have no one else to go to. i’ve felt like a loner for years now but i’m at my absolute lowest at the moment. the one companion of mine that i had for almost 8 years, my dog, passed away last month. i always said i wouldn’t kill myself as long as he was here with me and now that he’s gone i see no other reason to keep going. i graduated from college this past december and haven’t been able to land a job since. most days i just sit and play video games because i just get so angry at all the rejection from employers who say they’re hiring for entry level but require 2+ years of experience. i don’t have any skills. i tried to learn programming but honestly i’m just not very tech savy and i just don’t have enough time to learn before my situation gets worse. i feel like i’ve let my family down, especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college. killing myself would just be doing them a favor. at least i would no longer be a burden. the people i thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process. only things that seems to keep me somewhat happy are sex and alcohol. i don’t see myself being the type of person to commit suicide by hanging or an overdose but honestly if the rampant sex with strangers won’t kill me, the alcohol poisoning sure will. 
i hung myself, but woke up on the floor.
i tried to hang myself with a belt two days ago.  i blacked out and woke up on the floor.  the leather around my belt buckle broke.   i don't know how long i was unconscious, but i must have hit my head and hip very hard when i fell.   i have some broken blood vessels in my left eye.  i have no one to talk to about this.  i don't know how i feel about it.   i'm not feeling any relief that it didn't work.   
i wish someone would murder me so i don’t seem like a disappointment to my parents and people don’t judge my parents based off of my decision.

my dog stopped me
i changed all my emergency contact info from my parents to someone else months ago. this way my school and local police department would never know who my guardians were. today has been the hardest day in the past few months. a situation that happened to me when i was 15 happened to me again today. i already have really bad ptsd. so today made it worse. i cut myself for the first time in a long time. but i did it vertically this time. i tried to kill myself but my dog came up next to me and tried to lick my hands. i love him more than anything. i want him to never experience pain or sadness. i want my dog to have the best life fucking possible. he’s the only reason i didn’t kill myself tonight. 
i always tell this board i’m going to kill myself...
and i always really mean it when i post it. then i wake up the next morning and feel okay again. sometimes it takes a little longer. maybe by the next afternoon. and then i delete my posts on here.it’s better to post here than to tell someone i know in my life. here, i’m just an anonymous weirdo that keeps crying wolf. barely anyone even comments. years ago i used to tell the people closest to me when i felt like this and it drove them away. it got me sent to a hospital and then stuck with a medical bill i couldn’t afford.it’s better to just post and delete here. just another name on this board. i’ll probably never really do it anyhow. 
as of 1 hour ago, literally all my friends are dead.
all left me in 2016. my best friend was the first to go. she started doing heroin against my warnings. a week after her first time trying it, she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers. i remember the last text i got from her... next was someone i reconnected with at her service. i hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. he never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew i would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. his car flipped and his neck snapped on impact. this year has been emotional torment. i said i couldn't handle any more losses. then an hour ago, i get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer... i can't do this anymore. i'm sick to my stomach. i'm all alone. i have literally no one to talk to... all the people i could find comfort in are gone... maybe if there is an afterlife i can see them again...
a crude pic from someone who has been there.

it’s impossible to talk about suicide
people don’t wanna hear about it. suicide lines are bs. if you do open up to someone they suddenly become responsible for your well being which is a difficult position to be in for them. it’s also emotionally draining to listen to someone talk about it. i feel like a burden because being suicidal makes me one.
i attempted suicide and now i'm at the hospital
i survived bitch! well, here i am in the hospital getting some help and sleep. they gave me a really good pill that was amazing for my mind.edit: thank you everybody, you guys make me fell betteredit 2: i left the hospital hours ago, not gonna lie, i feel stoned but good so far. i'm having a good time watching tv.edit 3: things will get darker but my pills do the job, don't let your mind kill you.
something worth considering the next time a case of the bad feels hits <3

i want to go home
i want to go home.not to a place in my mind i once knew. not to my birthplace, or the town where i grew.not to my family that left me alone. not to the land or the house that i own. not to the west where my heart says i should be. not to the places i would one day see.not to the bed where i lay down at night. not to my “friends” who stay out of sight. each day it gets harder and harder to stay.afraid to tell anyone the things i should say.my mind has betrayed me like everything else.i finally realize, i have to do it myself. the truth that i find so incredibly sad:i have no home. not like i once had.i am tired. i am weak. i am angry. alone. i have made up my mind...i am going home. 
today i threw away my rope
throwaway since i don't really want this on my main account and i'm not sure if it belongs here. i wrote my suicide note yesterday and attempted suicide. i won't bore you with the details of that but it didn't work, don't think i did it right. this morning, i took my rope that i have (the only rope i had, specifically for that purpose) and i threw it in the trash. i ripped up my suicide note. i've told myself that i'm going to stay here and fight, even if i don't win, i'm going to give it a damn good go. it might seem rather insignificant, but throwing that rope away, the rope that was always there for me to use if i felt like it, is a big step for me. 
i made it to 15 :)
before on this subreddit i posted about how i was going to end it all in my birthday before i turned 15. here i am though. although my family situation hasn’t gotten a lot better there’s still proof that it’s going to get better over a course of a year or so. anyways don’t mind this i just feel proud.
i feel sucidal again.
i hate being suicidal. should i call them?
i think my depression is finally passing.
i've found a reason to live, i don't want to die anymore. and i'm beginning to enjoy the things i used to love before. i feel happy for once, not that numbness i felt for so long. it's been a difficult battle but i think i'm winning it.
why is suicide so bad anyway?
people keep trying to talk me out of it. i don't get why. they keep using different types of arguments, and i really don't believe in any of them.is it selfish because of the people who care about you? well, how is me living a life i don't want to just to comfort their lives not selfish from them? moreover, what about the people who have no one to care for them?(not my case, but still, it's quite a common cause of suicide)is it cowardly? i really don't think so. every little inch of your body tries to stop you from doing it, so coming to the decision, and moreover actually doing it takes a lot of courage and determination.do things get better? well, what if they fucking don't? for years, i keep hoping to get to a better life, to start properly enjoying it, but it just doesn't work out. i even moved to a different country, hoping for a new(and better) life. truth be told, i'm just not meant to live a good life. i don't know, maybe i was a massive asshole in a past life(if that's a thing) and now karma is working its way.people are so hypocritical, i swear. they all use the my body, my choice argument to support transgender people(and more others, but this was the first that came into my mind), yet they fail to acknowledge that this principle works exactly the same for suicidal people. i never asked for this. if(well, obviously hypothetically speaking) i could have gotten a choice whether to be born or not, i might have just said no, so i should have a right to end my miserable existence whenever the hell i want. after all, i have a right to live, not an obligation to do so. huge difference.*edit*: in all fairness, i have to admit that there are situations in which suicide is kind of a dick move. for example, if you have children which still depend on you, killing yourself would more or less ruin their future. so yes, in that case, i disagree with suicide. however, i'm single and i don't have any kids(or any other person whose life depends on me other than myself), so offing myself would not affect anyone in the end.
wanted to share this with you guys - i asked out a girl today
(xpost from r/foreveraloneadating)i was on the train to penn station and i saw a 10/10 girl reading a book and sat next to her. along the way i asked good book? and she said yeah and told me about it. then, when the train arrived, i said, i'm sorry but i have to ask i'll hate myself if i don't - you are absolutely gorgeous and you seem really nice; if i gave you my number would you give me a call? she said sure and took my number.
i've lost my son to suicide last week
hello humanity.last thursday, my son alex took his own life. he left no note and there was no indication of his intention to do this. our family came together in this great sorrow.i would like people to take away light from this event. alex was 25. he was a beautiful and kind person that knew how to give but had difficulty in receiving.we, all of us question what more we could have done to bring more love into his life, but we have no answers and we feel a profound sorrow at the loss of  this beautiful man.please, i ask that anyone just please take a breath if this is your contemplation and know that you are loved even if in your moment of despair in that dark place. please find that you are love and that you have love to give in this world. there are still people, perhaps some you have not even met yet that need your love in their own life.know you are light and you shine farther than you yourself may be able to perceive. know this. take that breath. find your peace in the love you have and the love you get.peace.
no throwaway account. it's me. i need help. the suicide hotline has been useless.
i owe thousands of dollars.i have been stabbed in the back by yet another person, worked fifty+ hours and got paid nothing and now i'm going to screw my best friend with no rent payment this month, or money for anything else.but who gives a shit about money. sure, i made a mistake working two months for no pay with someone else and am now screwed. (different than above) sure, the person i trusted most as a friend i just found out has been ripping me behind my back because she thinks i'm in love with her. the person i am in love with, my ex-wife, has moved on, despite the fact that she promised a second chance after i took some time to fix myself and my problems. i have no job. no one. my family is utterly miserable and just judges everything that i do. i am 28 and cannot even afford the healthcare i need to take care of my ms, my collapsed ankles and my add which keeps me from focusing on anything. my hand is shaking like mad and i'm doing what i can to avoid painkillers.i know it's completely stupid, but i find it hard to believe i'll ever find anyone who will love me as much as the two people i've screwed over. i'm out of options and pretty sure i'm at my limits.i never went to europe, never even went to the east coast. if i believed in reincarnation or religion, i'd probably not be as worried, but at this point, i've got nothing left.the suicide hotline was useless, my therapist is an idiot and i can't afford her anymore anyways, my friends are clueless and i'm out of options. reddit is my last hope to maybe find someone to help me out. i just can't seem to find a reason for myself, yeah i know i'm insanely selfish, but i just can't seem to find a reason to stay here.
i went out last night, and you won't believe what happened. it has to be a sign...
i'm not religious.  i don't believe in supernatural things.  but is this a sign?yesterday was terrible for me.  every day is now.  the only thing i have that makes my life worth living - my girlfriend - is about to be gone.i don't have any friends or a social circle (literally zero friends or family). i've been trying to go out at night - maybe i can meet another girl the way i met my girlfriend.  maybe i can stay alive.i got downtown and started walking over towards the bars. that's when i saw something approaching me.  it was a huge group of people, running with flashing lights and all wearing the same shirts.   it's like they were running a marathon.i asked someone what was going on, and that's when i saw their shirt.  it said one night.  one goal.  stop suicide.they explained to me that it was a charity run to raise money for suicide prevention.  is this not just a sign of something?  this is the darkest period of my life, and i've been through some shit.  but last night, when i decided to go out instead of hyperventilate and cry in my apartment, that's what i came across.
to those saying 'you'll hurt so many people by dying'
look, pal. i've got nobody. i've celebrated both my 18th, and 20th (and many more) birthdays alone, crying my guts out. never have i ever had a boyfriend of any sorts, boys wouldn't even try to bully me from a distance.my childhood best friend hasn't chatted with me in years and the only encounters we have are extremely awkward and unpleasant. my parents both have depression and are mostly emotionless creatures who never listen to what i have to say. they love watching tv and sitting at home. my mom thinks i'm autistic. my classmates show me pity sometimes, but jump out of the train whenever i try to communicate with them like normal people.i'm sick and tired of 'behaving myself' so others would be happy that i don't cause any trouble.i pray every single day i get cancer so at least somebody (doctors) would care about me for a bit before i finally die. sometimes i dream of losing a limb, or ending up in a wheelchair, but i just don't care. if that happened i would no longer have to try to pretend to be useful.i just wish, so very badly, to just disappear. everyone hates me and i hate me. and i want to die.
i write this on my way to the top of a building.
as i look out over the cityscape. i feel like i should apologize. smoking a cigarette, listening to music, i feel free here. this sight is wonderful. to my best friend; i'm going to miss you. i'm so sorry about this. i love you immensely and always stay true to who you are because i want you to live for you. i know you get caught up in other people sometimes, and that's fine. be yourself always. to my other very close and best friends, i love you all too, and the amount of stuff you have all supported me through has been immense. thank you for being there. to my mum: i love you mum, i couldn't have asked for a stronger, or better role model. please forgive me. to my dad: please finish the project car, for both of us. i know you might not want to after i'm gone but i want you to do it for us. to my brother, make sure your daughter grows up safe. i care about her. i care about you, please stay strong. to my other family: thank you all. to the people that contributed to this: fuck you. i'll never escape the torment that you put me through. the pain, the uncertainty, making me feel like i'm no longer me. fuck you for making me feel this way. fuck you. 
thank you, reddit, for keeping me alive
there's a lot of pain and sadness here, but there's also a lot of hope and a lot of people who genuinely care. more than most of the therapists i've ever had, to be honest. no one here is going to commit you to a hospital, or rat you out to your boss, or tell you to just cheer up and take a zumba class \(seriously, i wish i were making that last one up\).i came here a year ago because i wanted to kill myself. i spent a year here thinking about it. i've spent the past two months deciding that i \-don't\- want to kill myself. someday in the future maybe i'll swing back to wanting it. you know what? no matter what, i'll always have this place to write my thoughts down, and i'll always have people here who will listen to my stupid problems. all that money spent on therapy and meds and the place that made me not want to kill myself was right here for free. go figure.i wish that the guy who killed himself two months ago \(would post his user name but i assume rules won't allow for that\) was here to read this. that his posts got me on this path in the first place. i hope he's at peace now, anyway. to everyone else, please keep on posting and replying to things. you're all fucking amazing. 
i wish i could be legally euthanized
i have schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype. medication works for me only some of the time, and the side effects make it so that even when i am sane i am trapped in a state of joyless sedated apathy. antipsychotics took every last little bit of imagination and happiness i had left and now i am a shell who literally goes to work, comes home, and stares at the wall until i can fall asleep. i am 25 and have been sick for over 10 years now - how am i supposed to keep going for another 40 years like this, poor, barely able to work, still surrounded by hallucinations on the regular because the horrible medications don't even work properly on me. if i take my meds, life becomes a chore that offers no relief. if i don't take my meds, i have crazy states of mania and hallucinations and end up jobless and alone. i feel like this illness stole everything from me. i wish i could go to the doctor and tell them, i am incurably mentally ill and i would like to die, and be offered an option for a peaceful death. i wish that there was an end to this suffering.
wish i could press a button to die instantly
killing yourself is so much work
zero motivation to live but zero motivation to die. just kinda want to not exist but not die at the same time?
i dont know if that makes sense. feeling massively depressed for most of my life growing up and i feel like even if i get over depression i won't get over trauma i experienced which sorta still creeps up on me. at times i wish i could disappear cause i feel it wouldn't matter, but i can't make myself do it cause i know itd hurt people even if i tell myself they wouldn't bother. i get by by just sorta blocking these feelings and depersonalizing to the point it doesnt hit me but it leaves me feeling totally dead inside which i guess is why id rather not be alive cause it doesnt feel like im living yknow?the only time i feel something genuinely is when i hurt myself but it leaves my face bruised and its hard to make up excuses when people ask but sometimes i wish someone would ask about it genuinely because its draining feeling this disconnected from the world and myself and im too afraid to find help so it just eats away at me
i joined this community two weeks ago. and i’ve read too many suicide letters.
as a suicidal person i guess that what i wanted, joining this community, was people who understand me, posts to relate to, maybe share a few experiences. i wanted to commit suicide, i still want to. i have a million reasons to. but you can give me million reasons why you want to kill yourself i’ll still try to convince you not to. isn’t that ironic? i get frustrated when people tell me not to kill myself, when they tell me life is so much better. i hate life and i want to die so bad. and every person trying to keep me alive pisses me off. if i’m not happy then what’s the point? except your own satisfaction? yet every time someone on reddit posts a suicide letter, telling they’re done, they can’t do this anymore, i panic. i comment, i text them, i save their post to check later if they come back, if they tell us they’re still alive. i spent nights shaking, crying, thinking of those people. of every person in this community. are they still alive? so many members yet so few online. how many members of this community are dead? how many accounts stopped posting, upvoting, commenting, after posting a suicide letter? or maybe they’re still alive, at the hospital right now. did someone save them? if not, will i be the next one? why do i care so much if i understand them? or maybe i care because i understand them? i’m so lost. i’m so scared.am i the only one feeling that way?&#x200b;guys, i swear. i do care about you. i understand you. and i wish i could do something. if there’s anything i could do to help tell me. even though i know it’s not that easy. and i can’t do much.

this is the short version of my story so i had an older brother. i had one. he was always depressed. he even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. that happened about 2 years ago (i was 14, i’ve recently turned 16). one month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. he then shot him self in the head. i rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. since then i’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and i am extremely depressed. everytime i close my eyes i see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. i have multiple panic attacks everyday. i don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ i mean communicate not literally talk.). i can’t do this anymore. im sitting with a knife next to me. i don’t know if i should do it. please help meedit: thank you all for being so positive, it helped. i put the knife away and i will try to sleep for a bit.thanks to each and every single one of youedit 2: thank you for the gold.i also want to thank every person that has offered me to talk with them, i really appreciate it.im sorry for bothering you guysedit 3: its bad. i had a panic attack and cut myself. edit 4: a day since posting. im still alive but not in a good stateedit 5: still alive, my parents will be home tomorrow i will talk to them about therapy edit 6: this is the final edit. i tried to kill myself.i cut myself pretty bad and almost died. im okay now and im going to therapy. thanks for the support.
my best friend of ~18 years is engaged to the man who sexually assaulted me
i have always had a shitty life but this just takes the cake. in 2016 i was raped. it was the hardest time in my life, and i attempted suicide then. clearly i survived and am still here. tonight i just found out that the girl who i’ve been best friends with since we were in elementary is engaged to the boy who raped me. and yes she knows he raped me. she is very aware of the fact. it turns out she has been hooking up with him since my assault.  and they are now engaged. she’s somehow kept it a secret from me (i’ve moved away for college so we don’t see each other every day like we used to) but she accidentally forgot to untag herself from a post and so i saw a post of the two of them together in facebook. this is the girl who calls me her sister, says she loves me more than anyone, tells me she’ll always be there for me. so it hit me tonight. no one actually fucking cares about me. clearly not. the person who claimed to have cared the most about me is marrying the man who ruined my life. i feel like it’s 2016 all over again. i feel like all progress i’ve made is lost and i’m back right where i was. i don’t want to wake up tomorrow morning. i don’t know how to pretend everything’s fine anymore. 
update:i told my mom
if you look on my profile you’ll see my post earlier on this sub about being suicidal. it finally overpowered me and i told my mom. she told me that she loves me and that i’m gonna be happy again. we might go to a therapist soon. i’m also still talking to that girl and we’re both getting closer and dealing with this fucked up world together. thanks so much for your advice guys, you saved my fucking life. i love you guys and i’m trying to love life again.
i wish they allowed people to donate their hearts when alive. it is a good way to have a painless death while also helping the people in desperate need of one.

death isn't the worst thing, waking up and realizing you're constantly in pain is.
can't even find the motivation to do anything anymore because my brain tries to pretend everything is alright, that stupid piece of shit. i have to make myself feel like crap in order to try and get anything done. i don't want to feel pain anymore. i've always told myself i'd make it out of this, that i'd live an enjoyable life after all, but i realize nothing is set in stone. 
it's so much harder to kill yourself than they make it seem.
or maybe i'm just not trying hard enough.i don't want to do this anymore.
my wife's boyfriend told me to kill myself
my wife left me in september after 8 years of marriage. this last saturday, i received a phone call from my wife's number. when i picked up, there was a man's voice on the other end. the first question he asked was why i hadn't already killed myself. i was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. he kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if i did so. he told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. i haven't seen them since september. they are only 7 and 6. he said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because i am over 200 miles away from them. on sunday, november 12th, i attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication. before i was fully unconscious, my sister stopped by because she hadn't heard from me in over a day. when i came to, i was in the trauma unit upside down with tubes in my nose and neck, one pumping the contents of my stomach out, while the other was desperately pumping dopamine into my bloodstream. after spending 48 hours in the icu, i'm home. i have an appointment on the 22nd of november with a therapist and a doctor, but i don't think that's soon enough. i'm scared. and ashamed. and i feel even more alone. i miss my wife and my children dearly. which makes this so difficult to comprehend. i still can't believe that someone could say that to another human being. it cut deeper than any wound i could possibly imagine.
i'll just leave this here for you all - think about it.

life feels like perpetual homework i don't give a shit about and don't want to finish. but i am forcing myself to care about it for some reason. do you relate?

killing yourself is selfish
you might've heard this when mentioning suicide to somebody, or talking about it. maybe you even said it to someone else if you're not suicidal. i'll make this clear, it's fucking rude! seriously, what is insulting a suicidal person gonna do? i'll tell you what it won't do, it won't pull them away from the edge. i had a friend who was at the bottom point, where they could hardly do anything, and they spent 2 months in a hospital due to brain damage from asphyxiation, and even longer in a different hospital while they took medicine and rehabilitation courses. i asked them years later what pushed them too far during a conversation about it, and they said i kept hearing how selfish i was being, and i hated it and it just made me want to do it more and more. i only pulled back when they stopped saying that, (a doctor) told my family to stop saying it because it was untrue, and i felt a relief knowing he knew better than they did, and he knew it wasn't selfishness to me... he went on for a while. i wish i took more of it to heart though, maybe i wouldn't feel so bad.
anyone else feeling like they never truly connect with anyone?
like you're so distanced and can never truly be there, not just in relationships but with everything as whole. feel really truly alone. even if i have friends i still feel alone. 
it is likely that i’ll lose my husband to suicide.
we’ve been married 12 years and have 4 kids. he attempted suicide once, before we met. i should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby. he’s been honest since we met about his mental health and i knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him, but i was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered. fast forward to present, my husband works in mental and behavioral health, he is very successful (constant stream of referrals to see him) he wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in. we’ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years. this past fall was the worst, he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job. he was really down for a few months.  finally we tried a ketamine infusion series which worked really well. but slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back. we tried a ketamine treatment yesterday, but it hasn’t helped much.he told me last night that he’s done fighting. life is just too hard. i felt like in the fall i had started preparing myself for the fact that i might lose him. i was seeing a great therapist at the time, and she really helped me. but right now we dont have health insurance and financially can’t afford therapy. no one else really knows the extent of his depression. i feel selfish wanting him to stay, because i know he’s hurting so much, and so tired of fighting, i want peace for him no matter what that means. however the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family, emotionally, and financially, and i have to think about those things because i will be responsible for all the pieces, and helping our kids navigate life without their dad. and i cannot imagine life without my soul mate. i don’t know what to do or say anymore.  i feel so scared and alone.** thank you so much for all of your kind words, and support. this is my first post and first i thought it didn’t work, but it was therapeutic to write down how i was feeling. i know it sounds like i’m giving up, but truly i will fight with him as long as he wants. he knows this. he also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as. depression/mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease. (in my opinion) so i’m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me. that said, i will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together. working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances. he’s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others! and we have a beautiful family. we have kids who understand how their brains work, and how to be compassionate. they know that their feelings and the feelings of others, no matter what they are are, valid. my kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have. my husband has taught us all so many things, i am a better person, and parent because of him. and this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends. and for those who haven’t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life, just know i hear you. keep talking to your loved ones, it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you’ve never felt that way yourself, but i am proof, it’s possible.
why is there no euthanasia for depressed people?
it seems crazy to me that you can’t opt for assisted suicide if you’re depressed.even if there was a mandatory period of therapy or anti depressants etc before.at one point there’s just little that seems worth trying, and it doesn’t seem fair to try and force people to live.life is just shitty for some of us.i get that the idea is a suicidal person could always get better, but then lots of people don’t recover. and lots of people then have to take it into their own hands.sure there’s a lucky few who achieve a peaceful death.but then what about everyone who spends their final moments suffering, or those who are permanently damaged from botched suicide attempts?i think the most peaceful method of death in my country would have to be gas. but then one simple mistake and you’re brain damaged for the rest of your life. incapable of doing anything to take control of your life anymore.it’s 2019. where is my suicide booth??
biggest lesson i've learned so far in life: most people enjoy seeing you fail, and will not hesitate to kick you when you're down.

stop promoting the stupid ass hotlines. they suck.
i honestly want to off myself even more when i see them. horrible service overall and they have no fucking idea what they're doing most of the time. hats off to them for trying though.
i don't want to commit suicide, but it's almost all i think about.
okay, want is the wrong word. can't fits better.i *can't* kill myself because of what it would do to my family, how it would tear everything apart. i can't do that to them. i need help. i don't want to feel like this anymore. i want to get better, i want to go back to how it used to be. i  just can't do this anymore.please please someone help me. i can't keep feeling like this.
why do others get to decide if we have to live or not? let me die.
why are we forced to stay alive? why do others go out of their way sooo much to pretend they care by setting up acts like the unusable hotlines and expensive therapists... if i want to die and literally end it all, that should be my choice. i am a burden and i am reminded of that every single day. just let me go. why does it have to be about you and your potential grief? i am obviously lacking resources and suffering from a life long illness that will never get better. so why should i continue to suffer? so you dont have to pay for a funeral? that shouldn't even be a thing anyway. i also wish overdosing was easier.
does anyone else admire the people that actually kill their selfs?
i want to so bad but i’m a huge pussy, but i really do admire people who have the guts too do it like kurt cobain or anthony bourdane 
told my partner i'm suicidal
he took it well. he didn't act like i'm the burden i feel like. he said we'd get me help. i expected abandonment. i expected dismissal. instead i got love and support. it would probably feel good, if i could feel anything right now.if you are also suffering, i hope you find something similar to help you through the tough times
i say i wanna fucking die to myself out loud at least 10 times a day.
i have an appointment with a psychiatrist on the 12th but i don't know if i can make it that long 
google cares about me :')

what are you realistically supposed to do? i fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option.
**option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.**problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. they may tell people that you don’t want to know. you don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. and being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.**problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “the only truly suicidal people are already dead.”**problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. abusive. if a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. it’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. **problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. and professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. like hell i want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. let alone without the support of a trusted friend. i just want to be better!**problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. it’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. it’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.**problem 6:** nothing changes. except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.**solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. i *am* suicidal, and if i need to prove it then so be it. **solution 2:** you commit suicide. people get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. after all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you.
i don't understand why suicide is unacceptable
why don't i have the right to end my own life? i can't talk about suicide to anyone in real life because the second i bring it up people tell me it's not the way and make me feel like i'm not allowed to even think about it. i never chose to be born and apparently i also can't choose to end my life. why am i being forced to live when i don't want to? i really don't understand. i really wish suicide was acceptable and people with depression can apply to be euthanized.
am i the only one living for other people?
do you ever feel like you're just there because you know you would hurt people if you killed yourself? i just feel like if nobody loved me i could just leave everything but i can't because i know it would change them and they would never be over it. and the thought of being there and only living for other people is awful. i don't wanna live on autopilot for the rest of my life 
i wish euthanasia was an option to suicidal people
i don't understand why it can't be.i've been suicidal for so many years but terrified of the consequences of a failed attempt. every week i try my best. i surrend myself with friends, i go to therapy, i exercise, i go hiking, i try to eat well, i put myself out there.nothing ever fucking works. i'm so tired of pretending. i'm so tired of trying. i want to explode. i want to tear my life in shreds. all of this shit meaningless, painful and maddening. i want out 
i don't think the sw mods can be thanked enough.
the mods on here that read these posts tirelessly and answer pms and pretty much just provide an ear to hear your story and do it all in complete anonymity are true fucking heroes not only among reddit but among humanity as a whole.massive kudos to you all.
anyone else feel like commiting suicide out of spite?
because i do. every single time my family tells me to snap out of my depression and go back to being the person you used to be i feel like killing myself in front of them. they don't understand the severity of my situation. they think i can just change. as if i wanted this to be my life. i absolutely hate myself and think of how every second i'm alive is wasted. my mind is a mess and the last time i was genuinely happy was ages ago. i don't know what to do anymore.
lessons from four decades of depression
my freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  there were several nights when i did consider suicide, which is why i am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- orwell had it right for me, at least.)  i am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  first i am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  second, depression differs from person to person.  i have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  my issue is the opposite: i go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  crushing isolation.  and always the same hammering question: why bother?  why bother with any of it?so why write at all?  because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  it has helped me a lot.  and i fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  but they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.for me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  each of these eventually leads to why bother and the dark conclusions there.  when i start down any of these roads, i do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  more and that below.my private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:1:  i would be happier if only... if only what?  i was rich?  i had a girl?  i had close friends?  it doesn't work that way.  i found a great woman and married her.  my depression had a choking answer, one i should have seen coming:  well, i have a great wife, and i am still depressed.  i must really be a loser.  grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  it may not work for you either.  stop the only if... thinking.  it is a never-ending treadmill.2: i need to be happy.  not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  it depresses us.  great.  what most of us want is inner peace.  happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  let the pressure go.  i suspect we have enough to deal with without it.3: the future is hopeless...   look at all the mistakes from the past...  never play time traveler.  it's another game where the house always wins.  the future is unknown and the past is gone.  live here and now.  what i am doing right now?  what's happening around me?  is it raining outside?  am i hungry?  do those french fries smell good?  is that woman cute?  is that man handsome?  when you start time traveling, put the breaks on the tardis.  there is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.4:  you need to get out!  go to a bar!  go dancing!  maybe.  probably not though.  not if you are introverted.  this well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  be cautious.5:  you need to get over it.  i am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  you do not get over chronic conditions.  when people say this about depression, my answer is always, i'm trying, baby, i'm trying.  then i let it go.what has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:1:  the one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  i don't... i can't... i feel... i need to...  it's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  take a deep breath.  then get out of your skull.  it can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  i can't.. no.  that cat is pretty.  the wind is really blowing.  what was thomas jefferson thinking when argued with john adams?  what would it take to fix that window?  get out of your skull.  you are on the titanic.  what could you do to save more people than they did?  would iron man defeat spider man if they fought?2:  do something.  no, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  move.  walk.  study astronomy.  take up cooking.  none of this takes a ton of money.  it takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but i believe in my heart that people have this power.  better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  hey.  long time no see.  whatcha up too?  i am learning how to cook.  not very good at it yet, but finding my way.  cool.  what are you making these days?  a conversation.  such a small thing, easily overlooked.  but small things add up.3:  stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  you don't even have to know it at first.  the sun feels good on my back.  that's all.  no pressure.  no unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  small things.  tiny steps.i am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  it would be a lie, and it would go against everything i have written above.  there are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  but its grip no longer has the power to kill.  i am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  i am merely looking out the window.  the first snow of winter is coming down.  it's pretty.  it's okay to live.  one tiny step at a time.
i think of suicide daily
for the past 4 months now, i think of suicide daily. i pick up a knife to prepare food and imagine slitting my wrists in the bath. i cross the street and imagine myself allowing myself to be run over. i hate what my life has become. i feel like i exist in some sort of limbo state between life and death. like my life has already passed and now i’m waiting to die. i’m a walking corpse. my dreams, my hopes, all utterly crushed by the weight of the world and my own pathetic inability to cope with people. i exist only to continue my own existence. utterly pointless.i isolate myself more and more and struggle not to drink. it feels like all i see lately is the worst in people and yet i feel disgusted in myself too for becoming embittered, uncaring and arrogant beneath my transparent veil of politeness. it’s getting harder to keep the mask up. i haven’t the energy anymore so i painfully grimace a smile and try to exit the conversation before the dreaded personal questions arise. i go to uni and find myself unable to look people in the eye. partly a sense of shame in myself and the joke that is my life. partly a fear that people will be able to sense how i’m feeling through eye contact. partly even a feeling of shame about possibly liking someone or displaying emotion of some kind in relation to them or what we end up talking about. my eyes are empty now. they’re just dead. my facial expressions largely none existent from years of abuse and collected hurts. people find me scary and intimidating and yet the irony is, it’s me that’s scared. scared of getting hurt. so my face is blank for the most part. impersonal. emotionless. inside i want to cry. inside i die a new death everyday as i mourn what i once had. hope, enthusiasm, vigor and love.having attempted suicide before, i know it’s getting bad now. i’ve started having disturbing intrusive thoughts of harming myself in public. i wouldn’t, but i’ve felt this way before. it’s a plea for people to recognise the pain i’m in and hear me. fear holds me back from killing myself ultimately, but i know from experience that once the pain of living outweighs the fear of death, it’s over. i don’t know what will happen in this regard. if and when that breaking point will occur, is impossible to determine.a part of me naively clings to the hope that if i say the right words, if i believe the right things, if i pray enough, things will change somehow. that i’ll be saved from the pointless, solitary, unloving and unloved life i live. maybe if i give up hope enough, maybe then hope will appear? i doubt it. i feel true despair. nothing, not meaning, not purpose, not love nor person is coming. i am on my own in this prison i call my mind.
suddenly disabled. husband hates and resents me. i’m alone and scared to death
a quick explanation of my (37/f) sudden disability: i was a completely healthy, active adult. a few months ago i woke up in the morning, and the muscles all throughout my body had stopped working properly (so weak they shake). i’ve been getting worse by the week and nobody can figure out what’s wrong with me. i’m in constant terrible pain all over and i’ve gotten so frail i’m nearly bed bound. medication isnt helping the pain or weakness. can’t care for myself hardly at all now. my husband is barely taking care of things that need to be done (laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc). he just sits and games on his computer. if i mention that chores aren’t being done he starts screaming at me until i’m afraid he’s going to hit me.it happened again today. he didn’t put laundry away, and i can’t dig through the pile to get what i need. he had just been gaming all day instead of doing chores. i’m too weak to tell the whole story but i wound up in a very unsanitary and embarrassing situation because of it. when i brought up the situation with him, he went berserk. i managed to get to my car and leave the house. but i don’t have a coat and it’s 36 degrees out. i have nowhere to go. i’m estranged from my parents due to physical abuse. and my friends have slowly abandoned me over the last few months. i’m completely alone now. i’m in so much pain i want to kill myself. and knowing i’m an unwanted burden who is doomed to a life of neglect and resentment makes me positive i should do it. i have nothing, can’t take care of myself, and i don’t belong anywhere because i’m useless. i don’t know what to do beside figure out a way to end it all. how did this happen to me.. edit: i managed to drive about 3 miles away and i’m hiding in a parking lot so he can’t find me and hurt me. i’m cold because i have no coat and no idea how to get one since stores are packed due to the holidays and i’m not strong enough to even walk to the door anyway. i’m hungry. shaking all over from pain and fear. i don’t know what to do. i can’t even think of a way i’d be able to kill myself because i’m too weak. why is life so cruel
i'm autistic and worthless. (18m)
i was diagnosed with mild autism as a todler. i was bullied in school to no end. i was raised in a strict christian family that can't take a fucking joke. after my parents got divorced i came to the realisation that marriage and true love is just a lie. i have suffered from adhd, depression, anxiety, and a low self-esteem. i'm ugly as hell and will always be alone. i can't take the pain anymore! the only reason i'm still here is because my family will be heart broken without me. how can i stop the pain?
i think im trying to ruin my life so its easier to suicide
even when everything is going fine, i'm actively trying to make things worse. i don't do my course work, i try to ruin relationships, i eat garbage or not at all, and barely sleep.i'm terrified i'm getting stupider, i'm losing brain cells. i used to be smarter i know it.i need to kill myself, i can't imagine feeling good or having an easy time getting out of bedi live in a garbage heap. i havent done laundry in weeks. i lie to my psychiatrist/psychologist every time.i need to kill myself, but i'm too happy. my depression is fake, i'm just lazy. i have too many friends, there are things i look forward to. but nothing important. i dont care about my future and i need to die.
i wish i could go to sleep to never wake up again.
i'm only 20 years old and i'm already pretty tired. it's like everyday i go through the same shit and a painful feeling of loneliness and depression hits me too. i have heavy social anxiety and i'm shy af, also no friends, no gf, and my future seems even darker. i cry myself to sleep every night and i reached the point where i wish i could go to sleep and die, because i know i don't have the balls to actually kill myself.
suicide prevention at the golden gate bridge actually worked
i’ve been traveling in san francisco for the last week. since i started planning this trip, my intent had been to jump off the golden gate bridge at some point during my stay. i was not planning on returning to my home country. i went to the bridge on the second day to scout it out. high barriers and nets prevent jumping off the ends of the bridge with land underneath, but a 4-foot guardrail is the only thing that prevents jumping off the middle of the bridge. i could have done it right then but it was the middle of the day and i was with a friend; really didn’t want to scar anybody. so instead, i went back last night around 8pm. i hung around near the welcome center preparing myself for a few minutes, then approached the pedestrian walkway. what i hadn’t predicted was the walkway being closed to pedestrian access at 6:30pm! i was way too afraid of getting caught by the cameras or patrol guards while sneaking over the barrier, so i headed back home and make a plan to return. my flight back home was at 6:30am, so i planned to leave my host’s house around 4:30am pretending to go to the airport, but actually going back to the bridge which opened at 5am for pedestrians. i set my alarm-clock for 4am and went to sleep. i woke up needing to pee around 2am, and thefull weight of what i was planning to do suddenly hit me. i started having major doubts about the plan working, worried about somehow surviving, chickening out while on the bridge but then missing my flight and getting stuck here, or the patrol people catching me and certifying me under a 5150. that would mean missing my flight, a huuuge medical bill since i don’t have us insurance, and a massive freak out from my family. so, after considering all of those factors, i cancelled the taxi i had booked for the ggb and rebooked a new one for the airport. i’m here now waiting to get on the plane. moral of the story: i never thought things like barriers or nets or patrols would deter people, but i guess it worked on me. this would have been my seventh and probably final attempt, the other 6 including overdoses that ended in multi-day comas, slashing my wrists, and starving myself. i’m sure i’ll try again in the near future but for now i’m safe, so thanks, ggb, for that. i guess.  
i told my husband.
i told my husband i was suicidal as expected he cried and got upset. he made me promise not to leave him. i promised him. i feel good finally asking for help, now that's it's the new year and i have health insurance i can finally get the medicine i need. plus i had a job interview this morning that was pretty promising. who knows maybe 2017 is the year everything turns around for me. i have a good feeling about this year. sorry if this isn't the right spot for it. i just felt like i needed to share with someone. since it was the topic of suicide i figured this was the place to post it.hang in there everybody.edit:words
a friendly reminder about pms
hello all!lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting pms, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the op asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)***so, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? what’s the big deal about moving conversations to pm anyway? well, there are risks on both sides. **for the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. when the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. people with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to pm, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. **for the people commenting** – when you move to pm there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. that is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. **for everyone** - posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by reddit itself. we will remove all posts that do this. ‘but skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **why else would i bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ great question! having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). the [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. so, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*##this is the bottom line:if you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. however, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. if you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for pms. you are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. however, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. please just be aware of the risks going forward. ##if you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. we will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them. 
warning!  pm methods troll is still active.  if you get an official looking pm with links to suicide methods, this is a known troll who is targeting many people here!  please report using the message the moderators button.

suicide survivor doesn't want treatment
hello, so my brother is 19 and he jumped from 5 storie building and is injured very badly, he is in the hospital for about 2 months now and he is still in bad shape, he can barely speak, barely move and now he want's to go home, and it would be a so hard for my divorced not rich parrents, why doesn't he want treatment? what to do?
my reason for living is gone
my boyfriend killed himself while we were on vacation at his family’s lake house. he left us to find him with a belt around his neck. we tried cpr, i held his head while the medics worked on him. i can’t get it out of my head. i can’t be without him. i don’t know how to be by myself. i haven’t gone more than 2 days without seeing him in a year, and it’s been 3 since it happened. my whole family is worried about me and i don’t want to be selfish but i can’t see myself here in this planet without him. i don’t know what i believe in, i don’t know if he’s reincarnated or in the spirit world or in heaven but i need to know. i can’t do it right now. i have a wait a while. i can’t do that to our families. it’s my fault for not knowing he’d do this, his family didn’t even know he was depressed but i knew. and i never thought anything like this would happen. i need him back. i can’t go on anymore. there’s so much pain in my body. every night when i lay down i feel the pressure around my neck and i just want it to end. i’m too scared to hang myself like that. i just want to slip away peacefully. i just want as many pills as i can take and go somewhere where my family won’t find me before the police. i’ll leave a note, unlike him. i’ll give people answers. he took all of my answers away from me. the only answer i have from him is to go with him. i don’t know why he’d do this to us. i feel him slipping away. he’s my soulmate. i don’t know what to do. i’m waiting for him to tell me if i should do it, but he’s not answering me. i don’t want to be here without him. i just can’t do it. i’m not strong enough without him. 
does suicide feel like the only logical option to anyone else?
life is really meaningless, it just feels like there's no point on staying alive, im probably gonna end it when i can '
my friend who committed suicide is getting no life recognition and it is pissing me off
i am off and on suicidal and for the first time in my life, someone i know killed himself. he was a high school friend of my boyfriend's, we didn't see each other too often but when we did we always had a blast. he was the kind of guy who would literally do anything for you. i wasn't the closest to him but if i needed him he would've driven the 4+ hours away he lived from me to come help. he had the biggest heart.now he is dead at 27. nobody is talking about it on his facebook (he only had 70~ facebook friends, but that's the kind of guy he was). his closest friends were my boyfriend and two of my boyfriends other friends. his funeral is on sunday on the 31st but he doesn't get a proper funeral. there is no burial. i am pretty sure the extent of his death being honoured will be it mentioned on mass on the 31st, but not with a single brochure. he was an amazing person. literally one of the kindest hearts, and he is barely getting acknowledged and it is driving me nuts. i know that those who loved him and were close to him are acknowledging him in their hearts everyday but it is just pissing me off that nobody is talking about him.he was thrown too much shit in life and was not given the chance to flourish. i just wanted to let the world know that they lost someone really amazing this month.
my last act will be giving my abusive family and ex-fiancee a body to wake up to on christmas day. i am a kind, sensitive person but have no cares left to give.
i just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before i die tonight. why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? my self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where i can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.when i was eight my dad died from cancer and i was raised by a single mother. from the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. she constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me i was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (my life would be so much better if you were never born). when i was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. i would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. i have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. she is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.i was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. the one thing i still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. i left school with straight a grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside ivy league universities in world rankings. i wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but i didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. just before i left for college i went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. it was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and i must have looked a lot more popular than i was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. she approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. it was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. i have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her i loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. i just couldn't get her out of my mind. that christmas she introduced me to her family and i saw what a real family is for the first time. loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. the next year was like a dream. she took me to europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. the second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. i was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. i trusted only her. by the time exams came around i was in such a terrible state i turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. i did that and tried to get better. i tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. i was in my twenties and had never had a job, i felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.i returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. the only reason i graduated was that i chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as i knew one exam would be too much pressure. instead i had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. i was so lost and embarrassed in life, i had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. i deleted almost everyone from social media because i couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the us. again, it was incredible. i asked her why the hell she was with me. she told me i was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together i would finally be able to build the confidence i needed to succeed. she truly believed in me after all that time. i asked her to marry me. she said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as i had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. she graduated in august and we moved in together in september. she started working at a nearby hospital and i went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. i planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. from september 1st to november 1st this year i no longer had depression. i was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. i was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. then she left me. she knew everything i'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. i travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. she has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. these last two months have been insufferable. we still sleep in the same bed. all i wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that i'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights i can't help but beg. she has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. she says i'm not a real man, i'm not funny, i'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. i guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and i made her laugh all the time. she doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and i have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but i can't afford to live anywhere else and i can't go back to my mum's house. it's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. she says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. they are *my* family too at this point but i'm not allowed near the house. her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. i haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. now i have to go and spend christmas with a family i thought i'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years. fuck that. i simply will not do this anymore. i cannot spend another day in this horrible fucking world.
i’m a single mother and i want to kill myself.
i had my daughter at 19. her father died from cancer when she was 10 months old. i fell into deep depression and wanted to commit suicide. but i convinced myself to keep living until my daughter turned 18. i had nothing at the time, but i was determined to give her the best life until then.i am now 33. and in those 14 years, i worked my ass off. i was working 2 jobs, while also attending college. i eventually graduated and landed a job that pay well. after a few years i saved up enough money to buy a house. i even put money aside for her college fund. so by the time she turn 18, i would have saved enough money for her to attend a university. despite all the struggles and barriers i faced, i finally felt content. all my hard work was finally paying off. i started to feel like life was worth living. the thoughts of committing suicide after she turned 18 began to fade.but now that feeling of self worth is gone and depression has fully taken over again. everything changed when my daughter turned 14. i found out that she has been sneaking out, having sex, and has been using dxm to get high. my daughter said that she became this way because...of me. because i was too strict on her with her grades and chores. and that she just wanted to be free. i admit that i do yell at her when she slips up, and that i can be very intense. but i have never lay a hand on her. i grew up in an abusive household, so i told myself i will never hurt her the same way my parents hurt me. i told myself i will raise her the best way that i can. but i failed. i failed as her mother and i was wrong thinking i deserved to live.i tried putting my daughter in therapy in attempt to help her. she told me she wanted to change. but it was all lies. i still found pills in her room. i even found out that she has a “trap phone”, a secret cellphone she bought from a friend with her birthday money. and she was still sneaking out in the middle of the night to meet up with boys to have sex. i feel like i completely lost her and she would be happier if i was dead. i feel useless. i feel unnecessary. i feel like i’m not good enough to be her mom. my heart hurts so much. i’m just not strong enough to handle this. i just want this all to end.
it feels better to think about my suicide, than my future

my cat may save my life
i was dead set on dying tomorrow but i had a crying fit and my cat just came over and sat near me and i broke down and just sat there staring and i told him all my problems
life has completely destroyed me.
i am a 25 year old woman now and i am completely broken. i will end my life tonight. my mom died when i was 9 and when my dad took care of me i was raped for 3 whole years. almost every single day i was abused. this left me as a severe depressed shy girl in highschool and i was bullied for being like that. i told my only best friend what happened to me and suddenly the whole school found out. i attacked her for it, injured her badly and ended up in a teen jail (we have that in germany, not sure if that exists elsewhere). after a few months there the guards started to sexually abuse me as well. i left my body at this point and wasn't really there anymore mentally. after all this, life finally looked good for me, i started a job and had my own apartment and i thought it gets better. but apparently one of my old highschool classmates then black mailed me, threatening to tell my boss about my past. i begged him not to do it, and he asked me for sex or he will leak the information. i had to oblige and took his abuse to keep my job. police never believed me because i had no evidence. he blackmailed me in person, not digitally. i couldn't prove it. after 1 year of being his sextoy, he still leaked the info.i got fired today and am now homeless. i am literally using my last phone battery to type this down. i have nowhere to go now. the women's help organization disapproved of me as well because i was in jail once.i completely lost all hope there is nothing that will change my mind anymore. i reached the end and it will end now. goodbye.edit: thanks so much everyone. sorry i can't respond to each of you. i am now being taken care of in a mental institution. all of you together did change my mind in the end...
the sad thing about suicide is that people make it about themselves and then life goes on.
people talk about how hurt they are or how confused...that they never saw it coming...others encourage them by saying that no one could have stopped it or that no one would've known that the suicidal person was in pain during their time on earth. people spend so much time making their suicide about them that they forget that they could have done something about it..that they could have reached out to the person before it was too late. it makes me sick. people post on social media about how heart broken they are, add their 'thoughts and prayers are with their family' bull crap, a few hashtags and boom. they're absolved of all guilt and pain and go on with their lives. i hate society. i hate the way people make tragedy about themselves and then go on with their life. i refuse to live in a world where a person could feel so helpless, so lonely, so depressed, so troubled, that they take their life...only to be left behind by people that don't think of a solution to prevent suicide, but rather about how hurt they are and how much it has affected them. what about the pain that you may have contributed to this persons life? everyone acts as if it isn't a preventable thing when it is. oh, well.in other words. i'm done living in a world overflowing with so much ego. i'd rather be dead. goodbye cruel world.
does anyone else just want to disappear with out the mess?
just simply vanish. there isn’t a soul who would miss me.
i wish somebody can kill me so i don’t get hate for killing myself 

anyone else ever just lose the desire to eat entirely?
haven't eaten all day and i'm still not hungry in the slightest, just tired, tired in my soul.
when you can't kill yourself soo you live as a soulless person
i'm the youngest in the family. 17. my whole  childhood  has been devastating. child abuse and mental manipulation when i was 4 i was sexualy assaulted by a babysitter  and never talked about it. when i cried as a child they'd tell me to man up or that men don't cry. and from there i never got a tear out. no matter how much of a mental wreck i was. i always absorbed the damage and kept it inside.  the weight  is heavy on my chest. i always was enslaved by my manipulative brother. ont day when he stole something  that i loved i chocked the shit out of him. they forced me to apologize.  and another time where he false accused me of something. i was mad i tried to stab the shit out of him. i got sent to my room. i cried and when my dad tried talking to me  he said that we don't  need your problems tooi've gone out and thought of suicidethen i stopped myself  because  the only person i cared about (my mother) would be sad. i may be suicidal but i'm  a man of dedication  and a strong mentality and  i promised that no harm should be donne to hernow i'm  living like this. can't feel anything. can't trust anyone. or open to any guy.
was drunk last night and wrote notes to my friends and family, woke up to find this one and cried.
dear me,i know how hurt you are, i know how sad you are. but one day, one damn day, you’re gonna look back and think, wow, times sucked back then, but i got through them. i’m happy with my family of four and i’m happy with my beautiful wife. the godfather of my children is my best friend and they always ask to see him and we always do. we wake up every sunday morning to eat pancakes and head to church. i work at a job that helps take care of my children and wife, plus i make enough to hand over some money to my mom and dad. i’m happy with my life and don’t wish any bad upon myself or wish to die anymore.at least, i wish that’s how my life could’ve been.
i feel like some fucked up npc in a game where everyone else seems to be main characters. like i've been programmed to suffer perpetually and eventually kill myself.
alt account because people i know, know my main account username.hello reddit.i would really like to die, because it seems like the optimist in me is completely dead. and that's a good thing, because i can't count the number of times i've planned on killing myself, only to have a tiny voice in my head go just wait a little bit longer. you'll be happy someday. i would like to kill myself, because yes, i'm a fucking pussy, and living my life despite it making any sense to do so, has gotten exhausting. i try sleeping when it feels like my head's about to blow up from the emotional stress. let's be honest, it's only a short term solution to a long term problem. before i ask you guys what i want to ask, let me try talking a little bit maybe. there's a tiny fucking bit of the optimist who needs to shut the fuck up.i've been working on my dreams of making comic book stories for a little over a year now, while also working a full time job. it's been rough, and what sucks is just the country i live in, which i'm convinced has to be the worst fucking country ever. it's india. everyone here is a giant piece of shit. everything is conservative and rooted in tradition, and it's been hard to try to exist. doesn't help that your country has a shit reputation online either, cuz no one wants to fucking be friends with you. what makes me empty inside, is the daily dose of demotivation i get from coworkers from my full time job (i don't have friends to depend on). it's been hell trying to manufacture my own happiness. i don't think i can properly articulate how doomed things feel sometimesthe worst days are when you're hurting and there's no one to talk to (which happens every-time i'm suicidal). when you believe the shit they tell you. i used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. it feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. these last few days, i've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.so what i ask is this. please advise some solid ways i can kill myself. i've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but i have no idea how to properly pull it off.thank you for taking the time to read this. sorry if i sound angry, or like a shit person or something.
fantasizing about suicide because it helps me cope.
i fantasize about suicide often. i do it because when i'm fantasizing about how i'm going to take my own life, i dont think about all the other negatives in my life. it's become like a form of meditation for me. it makes me feel calm. like i finally have control over something.i've come very close to doing it befor, but held back because i still have some people that love me and responsibilities to those people. but it has gotten more and more tempting as time goes by. the fantasy becomes a plan. and eventually, plans become reality.
thank you all :)
i just ripped my note and put away the knife. i was talked out of it, thank you reddit for the support. i wanna encourage anyone else that was feeling the same way i was to not do it, you will find happiness. thanks again reddit.
honestly, i hope there’s nothing there after we die. i just wanna disappear untraced you know?

i hung myself 17 years ago
i was 20 years old. i wrapped a heavy insulated wire around a tree branch, stood on an old metal folding chair and wrapped the stiff wire around my neck a bunch of times, i said to myself well, this is it and stepped off the chair. i was instantly unconscious. i woke up in a hospital thinking it was the next day but two days had passed and i was tied to the bed with sores around my ankles where i was restrained. they told me my body was wrenching and writhing violently and the paramedics thought i was on pcp. one of my roommates found me hanging and had saved my life. thanks, i guess. i was sent to a mental hospital with a very sore throat. turns out i don't like being locked up. i told them what they needed to hear and they let me out in 72 hours. i've tried to appreciate this second chance for 17 years. i'm not lonely. i'm my happiest and most at peace when no other person can see or hear me. there is no hope, nothing helps. i could see the future back then as i can now and i want/ed no part of it. i've tried. i've tried so fucking hard. i've had my last birthday. 
planning a suicide calms me.
every time i get stressed and have an anxiety epsiode, my mind subconsciously plans a method to kill myself. and before i know it, 30 mins will be passed and i will be calm as a clam. i haven't gathered courage to attempt again but i sure have thought of every possible way and calculated the risks, amount of time it takes, availablity of such materials assisting suicide, effective time to attempt, etc etc. everyday i drown a little more into the depth, i can't stop drowning, everytime i think this is little better, i drown 100 times more, it's like i can't even be at peace for 2 days then it hits me again. i am afraid of being 'happy' because i know the good deal of it is waiting for me. i can't talk to my friends, even though i made some through online, i can't openly talk to them or cry to them because i don't want them to drown with me in my depression. hopefully i can somehow gain courage to atleast attempt a little one, may not be deadly but gotta start somewhere again. that's all i can be 'hopeful' for. thank you for reading.
i've never felt more understood than when i browse r/suicidewatch
on the one hand it's hard to realize that other suicidal/depressed people are the only people i can relate to. on the other, it's nice to finally feel understood. 
i think about dying whenever i’m stressed
i haven’t been actively suicidal for a little over a year. yet, whenever things get difficult, my mind always turns to suicide. every time. i feel pathetic and really weak for feeling suicidal from normal life stresses...sometimes it makes me feel like i’m not cut out for life...i don’t necessarily want to die, because i want to fulfill my dreams (which are really basic...traveling more, making a lifelong friend group, finding love, etc etc) but things just get so difficult and i wonder if my dreams are worth all this suffering.
i end every day thinking about ending my life.
it doesn't matter what i do. i go out for walks, i interact with my family, i play with my pet, i cook healthy meals. and i still go to bed crying. i just don't want to be here anymore.
boyfriend of 6 years killed himself 2 months ago. i’m just done.
title pretty much sums it up. i’ve been depressed since i was a child, have wanted to kill myself for the past decade. i’ve always felt like something was just “missing” in my brain. i’ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and fucked up pretty much every friendship i’ve ever had. i’ve gone to therapy, been on meds, was institutionalized a couple times. nothing helps.it’s not that i don’t love life, because i think it’s wonderful and grand. i’ve traveled a lot, and done so much. i genuinely love myself and i love painting and hiking and film and so much in life.. but i just am so tired. i’ve wanted to die for so long. and then two months ago, the love of my life killed himself. we were supposed to get married. he was the only person that i ever had any sort of connection with. he was so unbelievably wonderful and kind and i miss and love him so much. the past two months have been truly, truly horrible. i never thought i could feel so much pain. i’ve had a countless amount of horrible, sad nights due to my mental illness but none even compare. i bought heroin to kill myself. i’ve never done it, so i have no tolerance so mixing that and a few beers will surely do the job. it’s also how my boyfriend died (not an addict, but bought it to kill himself).i’m driving across the country tomorrow. my family thinks i’m starting a new job (which i do have one lined up that i accepted as a “just in case”), but i’m really just going to travel for a couple more days, see some art museums, go on a hike, and then finally do it. part of me is scared, but i can’t go on like this anymore. each day has somehow gotten worse since my boyfriend died, and it’s absolutely unbearable.  i tried to kill myself a month ago and just ended up in a mental hospital that only made things worse. i’m sad about thinking about dying, but only because i’m sad that it can’t end up any other way. both of my parents have life long mental illnesses that don’t go away, and i have no desire to end up like that. anyway, i just wanted to tell someone. i’m a really open person, and it’s hard to not talk about this with anyone. everyone around me knows i’m suicidal (obviously, since i was just in the hospital), but no one knows i have another plan. sorry this was so long. thanks for reading 
i tried to kill myself last night and failed.
as of yesterday i was on day 8 off all opiate medication. for years i had drug abuse issues, but went on a methadone than suboxone program. i recently came off it and was struggling with withdrawals. last night i went and bought 20 8mg dilaudid pills crushed them up put them into a needle and shot it into my arm. i had about 10 seconds where i thought should i call 911 do i really want this, and than everything faded. i woke up 10 hours later with 30 missed calls from my parents , ex girlfriend and my only friend. all who had contacted each other knowing something was wrong, as i wasn’t answering my phone and was going thru withdrawals .i passed out in my backseat looking out at the ocean as that’s where i have grown up , and that’s what i wanted to look at last . i called my dad crying , i could hardly talk i could hardly see and i was to weak to stand up. im not sure how i survived as my tolerance is extremely low at this point . but i did. i felt shame and embarrassment this morning , i wasn’t looking for attention . i just wanted my physical and mental pain to end.but i’m not feeling shame tonight , i feel lucky to be alive, and thankful to those who care about me. anyone contemplating suicide , ask someone to talk call a friend, fuck go to a hospital. i love you all , and i hope anyone going thru shit, will get thru it.peace and lovej
who wishes life had an off button?
i for sure do.
every night, i consider driving myself to the emergency room, and then every night i remind myself all that will do is give me another bill i can't afford to pay
there are really no good options when you don't have any money. sure, i could call a suicide hotline, but all they would do is send the police to my house, who would arrest me and take me to the hospital. so super, then i'd have the traumatizing experience of being put in handcuffs for being depressed and a hospital bill i can't afford that would eventually be sent to collections and wreck my credit. i'd still be physically alive but still no closer to fixing my mental health and all of the awful life circumstances causing my depression in the first place.i don't know what to do. i have no one and nothing. i had some things to look forward to about a year ago, but those fell apart, and now i have truly nothing. i know i'm not being specific, but i don't have the energy to type out a really long story, and it won't matter anyway. truthfully the only argument i have against dying is that it would kill my dog if i was suddenly gone. earlier today, she ran away, and while i was outside looking for her, the thought that kept running through my head is, what if she's dead. what if a car hit her or she went swimming in the creek and an alligator ate her? then i'd truly have no reason left to be alive. this is what my life has come to. nonstop thoughts like this.i want to go to a therapist so bad, but i can't afford it. don't tell me that there are therapists who will reduce their fees or that there are free clinics. a) it doesn't matter how much the therapist reduces their fee if i have zero money, and b) free clinics do not exist in my area. at all. i've researched extensively, and they just aren't a thing. i say this because every time i've posted about my situation online in the past, i've gotten flooded with people telling me to go find a free clinic or to start calling up therapists and asking if they'll reduce their fees. it's exhausting to try to explain over and over again that those solutions don't work.okay, that's all. i had to say something somewhere, and reddit is free at least.
psa: what's wrong with posting a general people care about you, please don't kill yourself message?
we've been seeing an increase in this type of submission at sw lately.  you may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.first of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  but if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  this is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: > don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  it’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **a message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “i don't understand what you’re going through”.**  for our ops who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  anything  meant to be universally uplifting, including the overuse of the it gets better message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.we know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  that assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)if you only have time to write one message here, sort by new and pick an op who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  if you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!you will still help many people!  a lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.  edit: typos, added the origin of it gets better. 
c.s lewis on self-destruction - i found he puts the point across far better than i can.

i deleted my suicide note
was updating once a year for like 10 years. baby steps i guess.
i’ve gone from “i know i would never actually kill myself” to “i might just do it”

i did it.
after 4 years and 2 weeks of crippling suicidal thoughts, i called to make an appointment for an initial consultation at my university's clinical services. i'm scared for tomorrow, but it's the only thing i'm holding on to at this point*** oh wow, the support is overwhelming. thank you so much, everyone. i'll update again tomorrow after the appointment.
tried to overdose when i was 19 after breaking up with girlfriend - now 55 and happily married with 2 kids - i'm so glad i didn't die.
i was certain and i mean 100% certain that i had no reason to live at the age of 19.  i had lost the love of my life and i knew that life would be pointless without her.but i was wrong.  ten years later i met the most wonderful woman and have had a great life the last 35 years.  i look back and i am so glad i didn't die, didn't miss the life i have had, didn't hurt my mother who would have been totally crushed if i had succeeded.you don't know what the future holds.  things can get better.    
i'm not strong enough to keep doing this, i need help.
## i know i'm far from the biggest victim of the universe, there's plenty of people that have it far worse than me. i really need to get this off my chest because it's a burden i've been holding for a while and i just no longer know what to do.i know y'all are busy, so i've decided to put all my grievances in a list, also if you're extra busy i decided to highlight all of the key points:1. **i feel so lonely**, i've never had a group of friends that i could constantly reach, this has been my life since i was a child. there's plenty of people that know me and people that i can interact with, i'm not an unlikable person but there's no one i have any close connection with, we're just not simply on the same channel. despite this there're people that do talk to me and i've been ghosting most of these people because quite frankly i don't want to make their experiences worse with having them around me.2. **i have no drive to continue doing anything**, there's literally nothing motivating to do anything. simple things like driving a car to be wash, showering daily, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, etc. are difficult to do. my bedroom has been disorganized since december 2018, i feel really guilty about it.3. in my search for love this past year, i was greatly disappointed with **my first boyfriend, who apparently left me for his ex.** this has made me feel terrible inside, specially because when i began dating him i told everyone about him, i even told my family. he lied about having an illness and he dumped me because he that he didn't want for me to him deteriorate, months later i texted to check up on him and he told me he was back with his ex and he also told me to stop obsessing over him and blocked my number that very same day. **i was so embarrassed i didn't told anyone what happened.**4. i've had a **lot of meaningless sex** since he dumped me, but on the inside nothing really fills me up. **i don't even have any pleasure having sex** or have sex with guys i would particularly find attractive, however i don't know why i keep doing this.5. **i have a severe distrust of people** because many of my close friends and the guy mentioned on point number three have made me extremely distrustful of people, it seems every person i think it's a good reliable friend ends up hurting me the most. it seems that for people i'm an acceptable target to abuse.6. i often feel **my friends just contact me because they need something**, not because they actually want to talk to me.7. **i constantly have suicidal thoughts**, i don't want to be here anymore and i don't understand what's the point of keeping on because i know that every time things get better from me, they don't last. often times i could be walking near a bridge and in my head i start thinking on how can i ended it all by jumping. i've tried suicide before but no serious attempt recently.8. **it's hard for me to focus on anything**, it's been getting worse lately, for example i can't open a tab with a youtube video because i immediately change it.9. for the last year i've developed a horrible **habit of compulsive spending** shit i don't need, despite all my life being someone that saves money i'm spending it all. i've even spent all my savings from 2016 - 2017 and i feel extremely guilty about it.10. last year i've developed a really serious habit of **binging junk food**, like literally spending serious money on junk food to eat in one sitting. for example, this week i've consumed at least 20 cans of coke.11. i'm extremely **distrustful of people criticizing my job**, i don't like a lot what i do and every time i show someone my work for critiques, i'm mostly met with good critiques, but i feel like they're lying to me. for some reason, deep inside me, i know they're just saying that to be nice and not because they actually mean it.12. **i have a** **severe problem with perfectionism** and it has made my life worse. ever since i was little i do things like **compulsively ripping pages of my notebooks every time i dislike the way i'm writing.** this happens in every other aspect of my life. for example, if i don't like how i'm drawing, i rip the drawing into shreds and start again, if i don't like how my phone is organized i delete all the data and i try to reorganize it again, etc.13. **i have no will power to do anything**, not to start projects or to finish them.14. lastly, **i feel ugly as fuck**, i have always felt horrible towards my personal appearance, but lately i know i look like a hot mess.i feel in a state of emergency because this time i have really lost the will of doing anything about my situation, it's like a train is going to run over me but i can't possibly move because i don't know what to do. i've been to therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists before but i feel really weak right now and i don't know if i can hold to months of talking with a person of debilitating issues i have, so maybe they can finally tell me if i have something. i'm desperate because i need a fix for all of this things, i'm deeply concerned with not getting out of this.&#x200b;what is your experience what has worked for y'all?
stop assuming we have people who care about us
it's so annoying to here the think about the people who care about you line. a lot of us don't have those people. this isn't me being mellow dramatic or delusional, this is just my life. it also implies that youre life is only worth living because other people care about you, which is bullshit even if you do have people who care about you.i can't make a list if all the annoying shit people say to suicidal people but this is by far the worst because they make assumptions about your life. people don't realize the privilege of having friends and a loving family so they assume we all do. 
i tell myself that i am meant to kill myself the same way a person is meant to be an actor or a lawyer or a doctor.
it just makes sense that someone with no real skills no purpose no commitments no relationships to maintain should just die. i feel like this debilitating depression is nature's way of saying 'you are not needed.' like natural selection in real time. i sometimes sleep with a belt around my neck tightened just enough that i might shift into a bad position and cut off the blood flow to my brain. just seems like it's meant to be for me.
rapist approached me at store
i (17f) was christmas shopping with my little brother, and i was approached by the man who raped me. he said “hi kitten” and he called me his kitten when he raped me. in front of my little brother he said this. and then left. my little brother didn’t think anything of it but i’m mortified and ashamed and i can’t get his voice out of my head. i can’t breathe and my chest hurts. i don’t know how to get that voice out, i cut myself to try to focus on anything else, i know that’s bad but i don’t have any other techniques, i want to cut deeper i want to die i’m so mortified i’m so ashamed i just want to die i don’t want to hear his voice anymore edit: imso sorry this is so rambley and my spellings bad i’m sorry my hands are shakingand my vision is blurred imso sorry 
wish i could be a kid again
like the ages of 3-9 or something when you dont have a care in the world and your're constantly happy and life is amazing. i saw my toys i had when i was 5 and my favourite film from that time today and for just a few seconds it reminded me of how great it was to be young. i wish i could be like that again. now im just some miserable, insecure, ugly, depressed, useless suicidal fuck and i find myself completely disgusting. what went so wrong.
i have 48 hours before i'll be forced into military service. i'll have to kill myself in that time
warning!! sorry for bad englishi live in korea with mandatory military service for all boys and i'm gonna kill my life. i'm scared to go to military. i'm in a lot of worrying. i think to myself, what if i waste 2 years of my life that i could have done other things for like college? what if north korea starts war and i have to fight and be captured and tortured for life? what if my generals and soldiers are super mean and beat me? what if tomorrow is the last day i see my family, since they might die in 2 years i am in military?i am so sad, scared, and painful. 2 years seems short by number but boys who come out say it's longest 2 years because it's so stressful. i dont want to wake up at 5am and do hard training like crawl in mud and electric wires and toxic gas training. plus some boys who are bad soldiers are extended time for military.when i'm young at 10 years, i was so scared too everyday when i learn about mandatory service, and my mother always said: don't worry because when your older the law will change. but it doesn't change, and i'm very close thinking about suicide because it's so scary when i look at the clock and calendar. i have 48 hours and i think very strongly to suicide in the 48 hours. i never think about suicide before but this time i do for first time in my life because of so much painedit thank you all you lovely and kind people for comments and pms. sadly i can't reply to all, because i want to spend the short time i have doing important things, but i wish i could reply to all. thank you thank you thank you, it's so good to read and makes me so happy
dad just left for work going to get his gun.
made another account to post this. my dad just woke me up yelling at me about how much of a fuck up i am. they know about my depression, and my dad told me that i'm fucking up because i'm lazy not depressed. i'm not lazy, i go to the gym six times a week, i'm on time at my job, and i do my job right. something about college just really makes me want to die though. anyways my dad has left for work. i'm gonna go grab his gun and think about some stuff.edit: i was about to pull the trigger. then my dog came in and started licking my face. i'm fine for now.
what if i'm already in hell?
that's why my life is so miserable and i can never succeed in killing myself. and the little bit of joy there is in my life is put there to make the suffering all the more painful...
“i haven’t gotten better, i just got better at hiding it”
this saying hits me all the time. struggling to find hope looking at the end of the rope. 
anyone ever just listen to sad music and cry?
it's really the only thing that helps me with depression. man, i miss the past.
death is much easier than planning my future

anyone else feel like a wounded animal that just needs to be put down?
everyday people tell me to smile, to be happy, to have fun. what’s the point when you know you aren’t worth anything?
finally killing self at midnight
just sitting here on the cliff, drinking some coffee and having a nice sandwich before i go, might as make myself comfortable, kinda nice breeze up here if a little chilly, i prolly shoulda brought a jacket or something but eh little late to go grab one now i guessanyway enjoy your day/night nerds thanks for reading i feel like you guys are the only type of people that'd understand me at this point  edit: well not exactly midnight but you know the moon is right overhead, thats what i was waiting for because its pretty and i figured it'd be nice to see for the last time , anyway thanks for the chats and stuff i enjoyed the company before the end
it’s weird to think that some people haven’t experienced depression and that not everyone always wants to die.
as someone who’s wanted to die from a really young age, it’s almost hard for me to believe that there are people who don’t wake up every day hoping it’s their last. does anyone else sometimes forget that “normal” people exist? 
does anyone else feels that they are not going to make it to 2019?
i'm so sick amd tired of life. i have fantasized many times how i'm going to kill myself. thinking of my death makes me feel peaceful because the pain would be gone. i'm tired of feeling like i have to try to survive everyday. surrounded by a dysfunctional family, no career, no friends or significant other. i have nothing going on in my life. i feel so lonely in this world. i already planned the method. i just need to stop thinking so much and do it. i don't have an exact date. but i don't know if next year i would be alive. 
kinda fucking pathetic that the only reason i try to smile and be happy is for others so that they don't think something is wrong
i lost all self worth at this point. maybe it gets better. i highly doubt it will. 
i hate reading this sub sometimes.
i read this sub and even though it's supposed to be a community where we can all be depressed together. it makes me feel like a pussy for being suicidal. like i read some stories on why other people are suicidal on here and it makes me feel worse about myself because so many people are going through worse shit than me. i'd say i have pretty major problems with my family and lots of other stuff but then i read about how some are having way worse problems than me and it makes me feel like shit. was wondering how many other people felt this way. 
i wish ending it was as easy as going to sleep and not waking up
so tired of being here, just wish i didn't exist.
i want to die
shit everyone has friends or knows what they are doing and having happy lives or whatever. i'm shit smeared on the ground. i think i'm a kind person but no one is ever kind to me. i've been bullied and laughed at all my life, i'm an outcast in society. i'm nearing the end of the line each day while my sanity grows thinner and thinner. ignored and downvoted here too i bet. fuck this world. fuck the narcissist on their social media. i want some real humanity, compassion and people actually giving a damn, but i give up.
what’s it like to not want to die every single day?
what’s it like to be happy?what’s it like to be loved?what’s it like to have people who care about you?what’s it like to have a family?i’ve never known any of that. kind of wish i knew what it was like.
you won't feel like this forever! :) these feelings will eventually go away - they always, always come back though.
am i the only one to not find this like of reasoning reassuring?sure, eventually the peak feeling of wanting to kill myself will go away, but it always comes back again, too. it's this in general that i can't live with. the fact that i have - so **often -** in my life wanted so much to stop existing. 
does anyone else keep living just because killing yourselg would be too embarrassing?
i've heard a lot of people say that they're afraid of killing themselves because they're afraid of death. for me, though, death isn't scary. it's peaceful, it's desirable. but what really stops me from killing myself is how i feel when imagining my family finding out. i just hate the thought of them knowing i'm suicidal or have problems. i don't want them to know anything about my intimate life/my feelings. and killing myself is like telling eeeveryone that i was suffering a lot. it's just unbearable. i can't just showcase my intimate life like that. plus, i don't want to explain anything so they would never even understans why i did it. they would be so disconcerted. i also imagine them having to explain their friends or their coworkers, and what their reaction would be. maybe embarrassing isn't exactly the best definition. it's just that i've hidden so many things from my family for so long that i feel like killing myself implies admitting that i've been hiding things. and i can't allow that. i simply can't. it's way stronger than me. i wonder if someone feels a similar thing. 
fucking scumbag brain

my death would be better for a lot of people around me.
that's why i'm alive. fuck'em all.
told my mother i wanted to kill myself she said she hope i won't survive.
hello,recently i decided to open up about how i felt and told it to my mother since i have no friends around me now. i wasn't expecting her to wish for me to not survive. to be exact she said if i survive my attempt she would not visit me at the hospital and act like i am not her daughter.i really really wanted her to help me not to encourage me. i feel like. now i have no choice but do it so i wouldn't let her down.i've been crying for hours and to be honest i am really scared of myself right now.i just wished.... for things to be different.not just why i am posting here. sorry to have bothered anyone who read this. 
love me, please...
please. not even romantically. just love me. i'll love you back, please please please.
not killing yourself is a temporary solution to a permanent problem
seems like a fucking mistake in my opinion.this was a bad week. there have been a lot of those my entire life. fighting only gets you new toys, new sex, new jobs, new strangers calling themselves friends, and it all hurts you more. fighting hurts.
being molested by priest. i can't handle it anymore.
i don't know what to type or say. my mom and dad are extremely religious. i attend a christian boarding school and i've been getting touched and forced to do things i don't want to do by one of the priests. it happens about 2-3 times a week and sometimes more. i can't handle it anymore. i'm just so tired of fighting. i'm a pathetic loser. i'm using the library computer right now and i'm not sure if i'm posting in the right place but i just need to get it out there. he is a monster. he ruined my life. it all started with him simply hugging me too tight, then it was rubbing my thigh in a weird way. and one day he asked me to go to his room so we can go over some preparations for a ceremony we had. i don't remember most of that day i just remember passing out and then waking up with my pants around my ankles and him behind me and feeling this awful pain. he told me that if i tell anyone he'd kill me, and that i'm special. i sat on the roof for hours crying that night. then i went back to my bunk and tried to sleep. i thought it was the end but it wasn't. it keeps happening and happening and it never ends. i'm losing focus in school, i don't eat anymore. i ignore everyone and no one cares. he makes me go to the dark room with him every few days to help him and if i don't he gets mad, i tried not going once and i got f*cked with a cross for it. i couldn't walk straight for a week. last night was one of the worst nights to date. it was awful. he made me realize how much of a worthless piece of filth i am. which is why i'm writing this. i'm just done. i'm crying and it hurts that this is what it has come to. i wish someone had saved me. but everyone just stands there and watches, it's so obvious that they know what he does. but nothing. nothing has changed. i get it now. i just don't deserve to be saved, and i get that now. my name is matthew and im 16. i thought i was gonna be able to add more detail about what i'm going through but i'm struggling with writing this as it is especially from the library. i'm sorry to whoever is reading this, i just had to let it out. 
my son's girlfriend committed suicide, and now his no longer himself.
a bit about my son- before he starting dating his now deceased girlfriend, he was extremely depressed. he broke up with his girlfriend who was his best friend before. that absolutely crushed him. he used to be the happiest kid ever! he hung out with friends and was all around just a happy person. after that happened he became very cold and distant. he hated to go out with family and wanted to be alone.  he mistrusted everyone and even mistrusted his mother, my wife. he claimed that she was a liar and was manipulating me to get him in trouble. he thought of everyone like that.  anyway a few years ago he meet a girl, who i’ll call emma, and he did a complete 180. he was happy again and became a better person all around. he always told me how much he loved her. i don’t think ive ever seen two people in love as him and emma. she was so ingrained in our family that she started to come to family reunions we would have with our cousins every few months. his depression never really went away though. he went through bouts of being extremely sad, but he always found a way to “plateau” himself. emma, however, has had it much worst. he told me that she was beaten by her father, and how she had to grow up early because when she, her mother and her sister moved out, her mother became an alcoholic and was unable to take care of them.she and my son moved into an apartment and have been living together for a little while now. about a month ago he called me on the phone and his voice was very shaky. he told me that she tried to kill herself with his own gun. he told me that he took a week off of work to be with her. he also told me that he was going to talk with some therapists. that takes us to 5 days ago. i got a call from him and he was crying a lot. after about 1 minute or so he finally collected his voice and told me that she had killed herself. he told me that and i got in my car and drove 2 hours to where he lived. when i got there, he was cleaning blood out of the carpet. he stood up and there was still blood on his clothes. i gave him a hug and he starting crying. he kept saying things like: “it was my fault” and “i could have stopped her”. he told me that when they woke up that morning, she wanted a snack, so he went out to get her a snack. when he came back, he found her on the floor with her wrists slit. she was barely alive so he ran to he and tried to help her by putting pressure on her wounds. he said that she died in his arms.at the funeral when her casket was being lowered, he didn't cry at all, he just stared at it. he had this blank expression on his face. after it was lowered and people were shoveling dirt into the hole, he just started walking away. he walked passed his car and was walking toward the entrance of the cemetery. we called out to him but he continued to walk. i caught up to him and i turned him around and told him that i wanted to help him through what he was going through. he looked coldly and said, “i have nothing to say to you”. he looked like he wasn’t there. i could see it in his eyes. it was as if his body was talking, but he wasn’t. its hard to explain. he turned away and continued to walk. we later found him wandering aimlessly around town. i went to visit him today. since i'm a cosigner of his apartment i have an extra key.  i found him passed out on his desk and bottle of vodka in his hand. in his other hand i noticed that there was something in his hands. i opened it up and what i saw made me cry. there was a box with a wedding ring. he was going to propose to her! how can i help my son with what he’s going through? i don’t know what to do. i feel like im not doing enough.  
suicide hotlines are completely useless
i’m going through a rough time and called a suicide hotline. it was a totally pointless conversation. they just wanted to direct me to other resources that i already knew existed. i want to talk to someone, not be told to go to the emergency room or to get a psychiatrist. it’s like the people on the line assume you’ve never dealt with mental health issues or depression and completely lack common sense. i don’t need to go to a hospital or be committed, i just need someone to listen to me.
the “good” times are merely the times that i am able to suppress the thought of how much i hate myself. it’s not true good.
i hate everything about myself. in most cases it would be some sort of dysphoria or something, i believe, but i have genuine reason to hate everything about my body, soul, mind and personality. from the hair i have, to the messed up soles of my feet. i’d be ok with being a hermit, but i crave interaction with people. sadly, i can’t properly pursue proper friends or relationships because of who / what i am. i fall off the 1-10 scale. i’m literally a -10. i feel like whinging about physical appearance is just attention fishing though. my heads fucked. well and proper. someone turned my brain into a smoothie, and told a monkey it’s a puzzle to put back together. i can’t hear properly. i tune everything out to listen to the pains in my head. how fucked i am, and how much i hate life. but wait! there’s more!i’m loud, obnoxious, and act like i know it all. i don’t like being that person, but it’s inevitable that after knowing people for a while i let that slip. but look at the beautiful world arou-nope. worlds so fucked. 9-5 thankless jobs “but go study” study fucking what? so i can get a different kind of 9-5 to chase paper so i can slave out my own existence?there’s really no good i can see. there’s no help. psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, they all ghost me. self help doesn’t work either. i got fit and healthy, didn’t feel anything but worse when i hit that point of being fit and healthy, realising it’s made me no better. i don’t do anything anymore. maybe i’ll get drunk and flick through reddit. i go to work to sell my soul just to go home and sleep 18 hours because i can’t do anything else. fuck, man. what hope is there?
why do people try to prevent others from committing suicide?
apologies if this post sounds insensitive, in fact i’m very suicidal and have attempted multiple times, each time met with people who stop and prevent it from succeeding. also what’s the point of talking to therapists and doctors when you can’t be honest? as soon as you express that you would like to die they lock you up and set you back even further in life. so my original question is how come humans try to stop others from committing suicide when they don’t know what’s really best for the individual? they would never know what it’s been like for the suicidal person throughout every step of their life and what the future holds for them if any. i believe if someone truly wants to die they should have the right and freedom to. not be locked up in a mental hospital and or forced to confine in everyday life.. on and on every single day is torture and depression from the moment the eyes open till close. the suicidal thoughts never ever leave. so why are you so certain not committing suicide is for the best?
i attempted suicide last year and no one knows.
i got into a car accident on an empty street by my house in the middle of the country. i flipped my car.i was suicidal. i wanted to die. i wanted to die. all i wished for was for death and i couldn’t get it. i’m in an abusive household and i’d had a major argument with my parent where they called me basically every name in the book for the 300th time that month. i was leaving another dead end job. i wanted to live with my so, but my so lived 4k miles away and it felt like the dream of moving there was fading.i was driving home and i just fucking bawled and screamed about how much i wanted to fucking die. i still don’t know if it happened by accident or on purpose. i didn’t die. i laid in the ditch. i told myself as i crumbled out of the wreckage that i wouldn’t be suicidal anymore. that my parents would care about me. everyone cared for 2 days before they began screaming at me when i was too afraid to drive. that i’m a burden and that i need to get over it. i’m still terrified to drive but i just force myself to do it.nobody cares about me and life is repeating itself. in fact, life is worse than it was before my accident. i don’t even have a dead end job to go to anymore, i just sit and think about how i should have died in that accident. my mom constantly tells me she doesn’t care about me that i’m an evil and hateful human being, and worse than my physically and mentally abusive dad and i just feel really tired. i’m 19. i wish i could just end it right this time. if you’re reading this, so, i love you so so much. you’re my world.
anyone else feel like they're just waiting for one more thing to push them over the edge?
be it an argument, a death of someone i care about, a really bad grade, a failed exam... i feel like i'm just waiting for one more hit to finally give me the courage to go through with it.
i need to get away. to get away, i need a car. to get a car, i need money. to get money, i need a job. to get a job, i need a high school diploma. to get a diploma, i need to not kill myself by the end of this year. to not kill myself by the end of this year, i need to get away.

so i did it.
i actually snuck out of the house and made it to the bridge... it was hard but i did it.i just hate life so much. i hate school, with all the bullies and shit.i hate my “family”, more like my aunt and uncle because my parents are dead.i hate my living situation. i can shower once a week and get fed once a day. i can’t live.i can’t. can’t do this anymore. i have to end it now.if you wanna talk ill be here for maybe a few hours. edit: i am fourteen years old. my parents both died 5 years ago in a car crash. i loved them so much, but now i’m in a situation where i can’t love and i’m not loved backi seriously need help.edit 2: as of 2:25pm pst sunday, june 10 i am ok. i am being beaten and starved but i had to get this message in.
safety warning from the sw mod team: we encourage you not to trust anyone who violates any of the subreddit rules. do not respond to anyone who takes conversations to pm right away!
we've learned that someone is reaching out to help some of our ops via pm, tricking them into clicking links that go to ip tracing sites, and passing the information on to police.  **we cannot overstate how much we deplore this reprehensible and frankly stupid behaviour!**as a suicide intervention strategy, it's beyond misguided, and likely to cause more suffering and death than it prevents (see below).  further, it's a violation of both our subreddit rules, and reddit's tos.  we, with the help of the reddit admin team, are doing all we can behind the scenes to put a stop to this, but the anonymous nature of reddit means that people can sometimes find ways around the counter-measures, so please be forewarned.  if you're here to **get** help, please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules, and please report and then ignore any responses or pms you get that violate them.  consider whether you actually want help from someone who either doesn't care enough to learn the rules of the community before participating, or who thinks they are above the rules or know better than we do.  the sw mod team, collectively, has about 40 years' experience in suicide intervention and related mental-health and human services fields.  all of our rules exist for excellent reasons!if you're here to **give** help, please read and follow the rules.  we know that the points in section 4 of the guidelines may seem counter-intuitive - that's why all of them link to mod posts where we discuss the rationale in detail. all of these rules were arrived at in collaboration with, and with the overwhelming support of, the sw community. the rule about keeping interactions out in public is designed to ensure that bad advice gets debugged, and that our helpers don't get overwhelmed or overcommitted and end up letting people down. ***most of the problems we end up dealing with in modmail are the result of helpers violating the one or more of rules in section 4, whether deliberately or inadvertently.***i also want to say a bit about the sw mod team's philosophy regarding confidentiality.  we don't believe in outing anyone who posts here unless there's a credible threat of harm to *others*.  we know that anonymity makes it possible for people who are having really dark thoughts to open up and talk about things without fear of having it come back to haunt them, or without fear of people making assumptions about them based on their personal history.  anonymity is in itself a safety measure in suicide intervention, and the rare cases where it leads to a bad outcome are not typical - they're like the freak-accident scenarios where someone is strangled by a safety harness or smothered by an airbag.   there seems to be a widespread perception that calling police and arranging an involuntary intervention is the only/best thing to do when someone expresses any kind suicidal ideation - that's absolutely not true! suicide hotlines don't do this very often at all. for example, the hotline i work at breaches confidentiality roughly 0.2  percent of the time - that's **once in 500 calls**, even though almost every call involves some degree of suicidal ideation. an involuntary intervention is regarded as a failure - having your privacy violated is incredibly traumatic and it *always* sets people back, so hotlines do everything they can do avoid it.  hotlines welcome calls from concerned third parties. if you encounter someone anywhere who you think may be at risk for suicide, we strongly recommend that, unless you have sound reason to believe that a suicide attempt is already in progress, your first call should be to your local or national suicide hotline. they can do an expert risk assessment in real time, and quickly help you identify the best next steps. if *they* suggest calling the police, then of course you should do so, but most of the time they'll offer you a less drastic and more therapeutic way to help the person you're concerned for.edit:  corrected typo in intervention %age 
contemplating suicide due to being a 50 year old virgin.
i'm so fucking sick and tired of this life. i just turned 50 last month without even having kissed somebody before. i wake up everyday to this fucked reality that i've been given. nobody wants me. if i try to approach women, they instantly reject me. i hate being so socially anxious.whenever i tell this to people, they just tell me to hire a hooker. it's not just sex. it's the feeling of being loved. i've never even seen a sign that somebody could like me.  i'm tired of this. i'm about to end my life because i'm so tired of waking up without a lover by my side. even if i end up in bed with somebody, i'm just gonna feel like shit for not having done it when i was younger. i'm 5 decades old. there's no chance for me anymore, so why don't i just end it?&#x200b;
wife attempted suicide today...
i know that when my wife was younger she struggled with suicidal thoughts, but she has continued therapy for the last 18 years and largely been successful.  we've been married for nearly 4 years now and it's a particularly stressful time due to finances, my transitioning to a new job, several major problems with our home, and a viscous lawsuit from a neighbor who wanted our dog.  (was dismissed but took a year to get to court and was very stressful.)she seemed to be in fairly high spirits the last three days and this morning was in a particularly good mood.  as the morning went on we talked, i told her how happy i was she'd saved my favorite shirt from a stain, and she was laughing and joking with me.  she decided to do some chores and i played xbox.  about an hour later i got up to get a drink and noticed she wasn't in the main portion of the house so i went upstairs to check on her.  found her in bed with a bottle of muscle relaxers i got for a bad back and a bottle of her own daily mood stabilizers.  she had taken about 27 muscle relaxers and around 150 of the mood stabilizers in addition to a full bottle of tylenol, and she had attempted to use razors to slash her wrists and throat.  thankfully she is very afraid of cutting herself and was not successful.  i carried her downstairs and took her to the er.  (didn't know how many pills she had taken or would have called 911, thought it had been much less.). took the bottles with me and they sedated her and put her on a breather.  it was absolutely terrifying.she is in icu but tennessee has some rule where nobody can see or visit her until the doctor decides they can so i'm sitting at home trying to decide what to do.  i'm not allowed to call or be there so i got a nurse to let me write her a letter telling her i love her and that i'm willing to do whatever it takes to support her through this rough time.i've noticed when she drinks she tends to get more depressed, so when i got home i dumped all the alcohol in the house.  i like beer but not as much as i liked her.  hopefully keeping something that triggers her out of the house will help some.  i kind of feel like i'm taking her choices away though and i want her to feel independent and worthwhile not like a child who is in trouble.  do you all think this is the right call?has anyone had experience with this in tennessee and if so how long did it take for you to see/be seen by your loved ones?since she took my prescription is there any chance of criminal charges?  i don't care about the pills or lawyer bills i just don't think she needs to experience another trial.can the state forcibly put her in a treatment facility and if not as her husband can i put her in an outpatient program?  i think she will want to act like this didn't happen but i want her to get help.if i can put her in an outpatient program do y'all think it would be a positive? again i want her to feel free and validated.what things can i do to better prep our home to be a safer environment while she's works through this?thanks for reading and for any answers.  it has been a terrible day.
three years ago, this subreddit supported me when no one else would. thank you.
three years ago, i was in the worst place of my life. i had undergone a prolonged and horrific traumatic experience the year before, and then was thrust back into normal life as a typical high school student. i was surrounded by people who supported my abusers, and felt that what had happened to me was my fault (and people supported this idea). and then, i had a glimmer of hope that was so wonderful and unimaginable that not only would all my troubles be subsided, but i felt that it would make all my troubles *worth it*. but alas, i made a very stupid mistake, and i alone sabotaged myself. i joined reddit and found this subreddit, and [cried for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/1swjeq/what_do_you_live_for_when_you_dont_have_anything/?). redditers were patient and understanding. of course, i thought much of what they told me (it got better, other great things would happen to me, i would learn to live with my regrets) was bullshit. it annoyed me at the time, though i was warmed by the fact that people sought to comfort me. my mind was going in circles. it was stagnant. i had never experienced that. it was a very dark time.i had to push through another year - and it was perhaps the hardest year of my life - but somehow, i made it through. you couldn't pay me anything to relive that time. through fantastically random events, i got the opportunity to leave home and have a fresh start, and then went off to college, where i was able to think with a clear mind. it wasn't an easy transition. it was easy in some aspects - i wasn't homesick, like others in my college freshman dorm - but looking back on it, it was an adjustment. i am now much further into college. wonderful things have happened in my life, and i truly do like living. it's not that i get up everyday and short, i love life! but three years ago, if i had a chance to just disappear and stop living in a small, painless instant, i would take it in a heartbeat. now, i would not. i have had opportunities that are very different from the one i messed up. i can't compare them to the one i lost - it's not that one is better than others; they are merely different. i have been honored to have wonderful experiences that i couldn't have imagined three years ago. back then, i wracked with guilt and shame, hatred for myself and for many others. i hated when people would say, it gets better because i felt it applied to everyone, but me. but it did. things did get better. thank you all for your patience. thank you all for your compassion. thank you all for your empathy. it has literally meant the world to me.
i dont know what to do.
i recently came out of a mental institution after being hospitalized for suicidal thoughts.  i have recently lost the woman i thought i would grow old with and the best friend i have or could ever have... to each other. there was no dishonesty, or infidelity.  i saw their desires growing before they did. i love my job... its the only thing keeping me going. i have two children. i cant even enjoy my kids.  they are the only reason i havent ended it, but i can barely stand to be around them because i feel like such a failure.  when i came out of the hospital, the welcome back i received was amazing... for the first time ever i felt like someone actually gave a fuck about me.  i've been trying to meet people on dating sites.  my psychologist says this is a bad idea.  i've recently came out as bisexual to everyone i know.  i just hate my life right now. i hate me, i feel so worthless.  i have so many friends who keep telling me how awesome i am but i just dont see it.   sometimes i do but mostly i just see my faults.  i have recently met a woman whom i adore but i feel like i have already ruined my chances by coming on too strongly.  im so awkward when i try to show affection to people.  i.. i just... i dont know. **edit** thanks for the responses, im just so mixed up right now i feel like a deer in the headlights and life is coming at me but i dont know what to do.
just snap out of it.

i’m genuinely a bad person that deserves to die
but i’m scared
anyone else feel like they're living soley for their parents/siblings?
if it wasn't for them, i really wouldn't see the point in trying 
i feel like the dog that at the animal shelter no one wants to adopt so they have to put it down.

i'm so sensitive sometimes it's like i was honestly not made for this planet.

how, idk, self aware are you? and how much do you stop yourself from reaching out?
i have one person in my life that knows about my suicidal tendencies and depressing thoughts, the first person i talked to after bottling up every negative emotion for 7 years.  and i'm back to holding things back and keeping them inside.  any time i want to talk to her and just chat about what i'm feeling, i stop myself cause my stupid mind says uh uh, why should she have to listen to your bs anymore.  she didn't ask to be your vent, she has her own problems..  i had like 3 good nights of talking after i first talked to her and then that was it.  anything else was quick interjections in normal conversations like hey btw [insert quick comment/question].  anyway....  i'll type out whole paragraphs to her or sometimes for posts on here, and i'll catch myself in the middle of it and go oh shut the hell up, no one wants to listen to your complaining you wuss.  get over it already..  then i delete it all and stay quiet.i'm a little less strict with myself on here cause no one knows me and it's easier to just delete the post later or whatever, but y'all get the gist.i just don't know what to do anymore.  i don't want to bother her even though she says it won't, that's just how my mind works.  i don't want to reach out to another friend and risk having another person know about what i'm thinking.  i don't want to go to a professional cause again, don't want people finding out.  i'm stuck.
fucking tired of my life.. at 16 years old

does suicidal thoughts with no intention of going through with it count as being suicidal?
i have mild untreated depression that tends to come and go in waves. this last wave has been particularly long. i should be happy but i’m often not, and sometimes get into a short funk where i just feel like i can’t do anything - like ill sit for a few minutes and just do nothing because the weight of emotions is too much to bear. lately i have been thinking about suicide but i know i wouldn’t go through with it - i have a contingency plan sorta like that guy who decided he was going to kill himself and went to mexico for hookers and blow and realized he wanted to live - but a much less extreme version.does having these thoughts count as being suicidal even though even though i know i won’t pull the metaphorical trigger?
i wish my mental illness was worse
i still want to die. i have clinical depression and ocd. sometimes i wish i could cut up my entire body as punishment. i always have obsessions of me killing or hurting myself. i want to be miserable enough to justify my suicide. i'm just really tired of being a failure, and no matter how hard i try to be nice to myself, i'm constantly loathing my existence. i am going to graduate my college age iop this week or next week.. i'd rather kill myself than get better. 
can someone just say goodbye? i'm going to hang myself soon
hi,sorry that this is so attention whoring, but i'm going to hang myself this evening and i'd just like to feel a bit less alone. even a 'goodbye' comment would be nice haha. everyone has their own lives and stuff but someone acknowledging i exist for a second is kind of nice now that it's so close to the end. i've never had a 'happy' period o my life. just moments sometimes. i'm so sorry for my parents but i must not be too sorry. i just can't deal with reality. i have maladaptive daydreaming to cope, but i'm 20 and soon i won't be able to avoid reality like i can when i'm in college. i've wasted my life. i should have followed my passion, but it was a humanities so lol nope. but it's the only thing that ever made me feel fulfilled. i can't connect with people. i feel nothing except when i'm immersed in daydreaming. it's time to admit that i need to give up. 
i need to kill myself before next week.
that's the only option. iv'e fucked myself beyond repair, and i keep fucking up every opportunity to make it better. i have no passion for life or anything, and i keep failing college. next week my parents will find out just how bad i fucked up, so before i end up on the street or anything like that i need to kill myself since i have no future. my life has been fucked since the beginning and i keep fucking it up worse. there's no coming back from this. i'm done. i know this will be ignored because everyone wants to die here, but i just wanted to get these thoughts out in case it's the last thing i ever put out.
it’s less that i wanna die, i just don’t want to have existed...
anyone else understand this? and does anyone around the age of 15 wanna talk? i just... sorry
please be mindful of what you say or do to your kid
idk if it’s true for everyone, but for me, i remember everything. it’s probably the main factor in me killing myself.
i didn't commit suicide
this is a little update from my post of a few weeks back.in the end, i didn't kill myself.i planned everything out and i wanted to kill myself on the 10th of august, a month after the death of my friend eli.that day at 2 am i woke up and went to the bathroom with a knife and stayed there for a good hour looking at myself in the mirror.i don't know what happened but i started thinking about my family and i forgot everything for a few minutes. i was free for a few moments and that gave me hope for a future. now, i'm happy to say that it's been a week and i'm not that obsessed anymore about what happened. i still have nightmares and thought about her, but not as toxic as they were.hopefully, it will continue, and i'll be able to free myself from depression. i'm now looking to reconnect with people i knew from high school and i'm ready to start a new chapter of my life. thanks to everyone that tried to comfort me during that bad time, even if it didn't help per se, i really appreciated it. 
talking about it is a point of no return
people will never treat you the same ever again if they know you think about killing yourself
i don't want to live, but i don't want to die. does anyone else feel this way?

a very sad update. 
a few months ago my fiancé tried to kill himself. he went into treatment and came home and explained to me that his medication was making him belly-sick and he had to stop taking it. he was throwing up from it, getting pale and dizzy, and shaking. so i couldn't force him to take it. he found a new job and said he was doing out-patient treatment. on friday he left some suicide notes. he left a will. and on sunday his body was found. i'm completely heartbroken. i can not eat. i do not sleep. i cry. i scream into pillows and talk to him out loud. i ask why. he left me facing an eviction that he hid from me, past due bills that meant my electricity is turned off and my water. i have a four year old son who is staying with family. i don't know how i'll tell him his jamie is gone. i believe in god so i'm terrified of what happens to his soul. i'm pretty much totally lost. worse of all, the dea is watching me because he took pills that he had no prescription for. i have to carry on now. for my son. i have nothing left. i'm empty inside. hollow and at night the silence goes on and on and he's not next to me in our bed... i miss him. and i'm angry. he had another life that i never knew about. he was so far in debt, death treats against his life for unpaid stuff, and he changed my address so i wouldn't receive any mail or notices. he forged my signature on documents for court on the eviction. i feel betrayed. i'm angry. and i'm alone. so alone. the worse part is that we had been trying to get pregnant. i'm now 21 days late. 
they lied to me.
i was in grade 6, i was 11 or 12, and i got called into the principals office during lunch. the guidence counselor, toba, said there was a girl named lisa who needed my help: being the happy and do-good child i was, i aggreed. i thought lisa was the girl from the grade below mine who i'd seen around the place here and there,it was not. lisa was a cop. (red flag one)i sat down, toba did too. i'd only met her once before when i did an iq test with her for something. i didn't dislike her.lisa was kind, she was happy and smiley. she said hi, introduced herself, then put a black recording device down on the table. she told me it was to record our convosation so she could listen back to it afterwards, because she can't write down everything i say at once. i didn't think much of it. it wasn't recording yet, then after i said okay, she turned it on. (red flag two)lisa asked me questions like: *what is your full name, date of birth, address, ect*. then she asked me about school, what my favourite class was, if i liked it,*if i felt safe there.* (flag three)then she began asking who was in my house, i told her my mother, father and grandmother. she asked about them, what they do that i like and appreciate, then what i didn't like...i figured that i should tell the truth, because lisa is a cop and the recording would only be listened to by her. only her. that's what she told me.i told her about my mother yelling, my father always playing card games and not paying me much attention, my grandmother yelling at me a bit because her dementia made her think i did things that i really didn't. all trivial things.then she asked me if i knew what sex was. i felt weird. i said yeah. she asked me if i could tell her what it was, and reluctantly i started, but stoped and trailed off. she took that as an 'i don't want to talk about it.' and carried on. she then asked me more questions about '*how long since you showerd with your mother?*', '*are you beaten?*', '*do you feel safe?*'toba asked for a minute alone with me and lisa stepped out, the recorder was still going. she asked if i felt okay and if things were too weird i said *it's fine, a bit, but fine.*it got wack fast. i got scared, i started telling half-truths in fear that i'd get someone into trouble. my parents aren't the best, but they've never r e a l l y hurt-hurt me. not physically at least. as far as parents go, they're alright.at some point she told me that someone had made accusations against my parents; they said my dad was some kind of paedophille and my mother was abusive. that wasn't true. not at all.i had no idea who would do that, she asked me if i knew anyone that would, i said no. the interview concluded, and i went out... i felt really out of my own body. i felt gross. i thought about that crap like being raped, abused, beaten to death, left, them finding out about what i'd said. i did feel safer once i remembered that lisa only took notes and the recording was for her only.a few days later my dad asked if i was okay. then he told me they were taken to the station earlier and she played them the recording. the whole thing. all my true words. all of it. i felt safe during that, i didn't even think they'd play it, it was for lisa only. it was my brother-in-law who had made the claims. i don't exactly know why, but he'd had it out for my parents a long time. he is evil. he has done horrible things. he's been to jail many times. he's a bad person.a few weeks later i followed my dad to my grandmothers flat down the back of my house. he told me i should go home. i pretended to, but sat outside the window with my hand over my flashlight, listening in. my dad yelled at her, my grandmother had told my step-sister to stay with the brother-in-law who falsely accused my dad, and even sent them money for something. she did nothing to stop him. my sister enabled it. they later moved wth their two sons down the melbourne away from us, i'm not sure why but i'm guessing its because of this ordeal, and i guess that money was for flights.i'm not sure if it was the interview, or that night, sometime before or after; but something in my brain just stopped. i felt distant, i still do. i wasn't in good shape mentally before all this, but that interview pushed me over the edge.slowly through the years i've been thrown around, forced through some other hells, and never given any kind of help. i hate questions. i hate opening up. i can't deal with police, it's a trigger just to see them. being recorded or photographed is gross for me. i can't talk about this: this is the first time ever i've fully told this story.i now have some kind of mental illness, not sure exactly what. i think feelings or any kind of emotion such as sadness is disgusting and a sign of weakness: especially public displays of it. i have forced myself to be unempathetic and cold, i struggle with affection: i've created a psychopath essentially. whenever i think about this i first feel like lighting everything on fire and screaming, and then i feel like killing myself.i have a bad ed, and i'm losing weight rapidly. it's been ongoing for 3 or 4 years but it's bad right now. i feel guilty. so, so guilty. i should have never trusted lisa or toba, i should have kept my mouth shut, i should have just drowned myself in a lake when i was 3.it's been 5 or 6 years now... i still can't ever get all this out of my head. i've tried drugs, alcohol, watching tv and playing games as a distraction, writing and art, cutting, starving, watching snuff videos to convince me not to kill myself: but nothing has worked. all of it just made it worse. anytime i've tried to open up or ask for help people would get weird and distant, and eventually stop talking to me. that, or they'd go on and on about their own problems. every single time i end up being the one to help them, then they get better, and they leave me behind.i'm starting to think the only way to stop my brain from screaming at me is to silence it with a bullet.
is anyone else afraid of dying, but they're just more afraid of living?
my life feels like a lose/lose situation right now, living is constant pain, and i'm scared of having to deal with this pain until i die, but i'm also scared of dying. i feel trapped in life because no matter what i do, i'm fucked. even when i attempted i felt nothing but fear, but it still didn't stop me because it seemed better than living. i notice people think of suicide as release, but to me it's just the lesser pain, but a pain nonetheless. i guess part of me is hoping i'll just get more and more suicidal till it no longer scares me.
when you’re no longer scared of death, the world looks a lot different
everyone loses their power. you’re not scared of threats. you’re not scared of anyone. no one has more power for your life than you do. i have nothing to lose. 
19f /w first suicide attempt.. i found something in the er
i found myself lying in hospital bed. i found out that it was 2am, so the doctors and staffs were wasting their time with me by doing gastric lavage. next to me, there were two patients waiting for help. i found out i was a waste of time.  the first time i went to see the doctor in opd, he gave me antidepressants because he wanted me to get better. he trusted me that i wouldn't do something crazy like overdosing. but i did.. i did it all to myself and the doctor shouldn't have saved me for this time. i found that being in the er is horrible. i found out that my parents and friends are such an outsider. they kept standing close to me, trying to ask me questions why? why did you... ? do you really want to do it? aren't we good parents/friends? i found out that i couldn't stop crying. i found that i'm worthless, but why do people always save me and send me to the hospital? i just passed out from overdosing and i didn't ask them to take me there. i found out that the doctor doesn't really want to save me, but duty.i found that i'm a burden to everyone. and i'll try to find other ways to die peacefully (alone). for those whom loved one tries to commit suicide, let them go. 
i am alive.
and i am glad. i wish i hadn’t tried. i realize now i didn’t want to die, just kill the part of myself that was hurting so bad. i have a long road ahead of me but i now can see there’s light at the end.
just found out my friend took his own life. he was 15.
i'm not posting to get karma, i couldn't care less. i need an outlet so here i am. sorry for the shitpost. i can't believe it though, he was so nice to everyone. no one should go through this. no one.
i got a dog
i've been wanting to get this off my chest and just say it to someone.  i recently adopted a puppy, but nobody knows that i did it to help with my depression and suicidal thoughts.  she gets me out of bed, gives me companionship, loves me unconditionally.  and it's been helping and i love her so much but there are still days when it's hard not to think about ending it.  but i haven't been able to say to anyone why i really got her and i just needed to vent somewhere. thanks for listening.
sometimes i hope i get murdered
sometimes i hope i get murdered, because not only am i too much of a chicken to do it on my own, but i wouldn’t want my parents to think they failed in raising me.whenever i hear of another mass shooting in the news, i feel bad for the victims and their friends and families, but at the same time i wish it could have been me. if i got murdered (as opposed to suicide) then i think it would take a bit of the sting out of it because my death would be out of my control.
i was sold & raped by my dad from the age of 6, i ran away and currently live with a violent 40 year old man. i'm turning 18 today and i wanna give up.
 i don't know what to do anymore. or if this post will do anything for me.i'm turning 18 midnight today, and after a series of shitty events lately i've been forced to look at my life, and it's pathetic.i ran away from a shitty home at the age of 14 just to fall into that same toxic life. i started selling my body on the street, staying with whoever offered a place. i've been living with a 45 year old man the past two years, he helped me, fed me and even paid for my high school education. things were fine for a while, and i say fine loosely because my perception is messed up. let's just say i did everything he asked of me, all his kinks and whatever, the drugs, on a daily basis. but this year things progressed, he started bringing friends over. and even drugged me to near death at some point. i'm turning 18 soon and he said he was holding a party a day prior for me. the only outcome of that party was that i can barely walk. my ribs feel broken, my underwear are bloody and i barely remember anything from what happened, but the way my body looks is telling me i don't want to know. i'm turning 18, and while everyone is worried about graduation, i'm addicted to heroin, and it's ingrained in my mind that my only worth is my looks. i manipulate people, ruin any normal relationship i have, the only thing that's been persistent in my life is being used. that's the only thing i know, and turning 18 is honestly depressing to me because i don't think i'm gonna even make it to 20.i'm sorry for how depressing this is.
my parents are mad at me because i'm depressed
i don't even know anymore. my psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety and i honestly thought that my family would support me. boy, was i wrong. they just got angry and told me that i don't have a reason to be depressed and that it's just because i'm lazy and introverted. i don't know what to do. i have a couple of close friends and when i mention the subject of suicide to them, they just give you the regular fucking response. they say that it's just selfish and i have to think about all the people i love. how could i think of people i love, when they don't want to offer me any help. i don't even want to kill myself, it would be fine if i just got hit by a truck or something, i don't really care at this point.
it'd be so great to not wake up tomorrow
just drift away in my sleep
today i emptied out my helium tanks
in january i bought three helium tanks so that i could use them with an exit bag. i had everything setup so that i could use it anytime i felt like it was my time to go. around 30 minutes ago i emptied out the tanks and threw away the bag. i feel like i made a big step by doing this but i cannot really tell anyone that actually knows me. but i still wanted to share it with this subreddit. i think that i am going to try to get help for my depression and suicidal thoughts.edit: thank you everyone, your support gave me the courage to start therapy with a physiologist.
saw a picture of my ex today and didn't want to kill myself
so 2017 is already looking up. i wanted to kill myself every day i've woken up since nov 9. seeing her on social media would get me very agitated and suicidal, even more than i normally am. but today i don't feel that way. no more wasting time on thinking about that stupid what if. because it's not. so here's to finding love in 2017. thank you guys. we've all made it this far so fuck it we might as well see what 2017 has for us.
i think i’m going to kill myself.
i keep waiting for a miraculous sign to come and tell me to stay alive. but there is nothing. i told myself the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that my mom or one of my friends will have to be the ones to find me and i don’t want to do that to them. but i leave for college soon.. and i’m scared that when i go and have no one close to me then that’ll be the cherry on top. i’m just numb.
crying with a gun in my hands...
today, my dad just said the most horrible shit to me... that i “disappoint him”, that “i’m a failure”, and that “i’m a loser”. well, i can’t really take it anymore. i know something with me is mentally off because i’ve never once felt right. i think about killing myself at least once every day. and i was diagnosed with depression at the age of 4 1/2 years old. no matter how good the situation is in my life, i always get a sense of misery. i constantly stare into the past and think “why?”. i look into the future and think “how?”. so no matter how i perceive things, i always see them in a negative way because that’s how i was raised to think. i’m now sitter here, trying to decide wether to off myself with a .357 revolver or a .308 rifle. i know that either one will blow my head off and make a mess, but i want to go with a method that will eliminate me quickly. i have no need to make a final statement to my family or friends because i think my brain-matter splattered against the wall shall be a pretty obvious statement. at least then my dad will feel sorry for the last thing he ever said to me...
suicide as an emergency exit?
does anyone else here decide to continue live life but still keep suicide as an emergency tool, just in case everything will crash and burn and you'll be trapped? i've been thinking about it for a couple of days now, and there is a sense of empowerment in it. makes you feel much more in control. i feel less emotional about my problems.
i would feel less suicidal if i had money.
i know they say money doesn't buy happiness, but money would get me out of a place where i feel unsafe and unhappy. it would get me good therapy, sort out some of the physical problems which effect my confidence, and just take a huge weight off my mind. anyone feel the same? 
i’ve wanted to kill myself for a long time, and now my little sister has leukemia.
the irony right? it isn’t lost on me. i’ve spent my childhood, teenage years & young adulthood depressed, miserable and just overall tired of life. i planned to take my life in september, for personal reasons. today i just found out my sister may have leukemia or sarcoidosis - both serious diseases.my mother has already lost her mother, father, my oldest sister (died when i was 9) and husband (infidelity, deportation). i can’t bring myself to do this to her, but i can’t bother to live. my little sister is going to college, a national honor-roll student and has everything going for her. she’s my best friend and helped me through the darkest parts of my depression.i really wish i was the one sick, so i had actual excuse to die. like i truly deeply want to switch fucking roles with her right now. but not her man. not her. it shouldn’t be her bro. life is fucking unfair.
life is a game that everyone else plays better than me. i don't want to play anymore.
i'm so tired of struggling with the things other people find so effortless. and i'm tired of being told to just suck it up, i'll get used to it. i think i'm about tapped out this round. maybe the next one will be better.
running away as an alternative to suicide.
i’ve decided that instead of killing myself im going to wait till i graduate and run away. i’m going to pack everything thing i need in a bag, take my car, and head out west. i’ll just go wherever the wind takes me. i’ll just go until i can’t go anymore. i figure this will hurt my family less than suicide. and if it doesn’t work out i’ll just kill myself. it’s not like i hate my family or anything i just figure i’ll go out with a bang. one last adventure. 
why is wanting to die a bad thing
if i don't want to live anymore and would be at peace when i'm dead why is it so bad? why is it considered selfish? if i hate waking up every morning why do i need to keep living? if i won't contribute to society at all when i'm older what use is it? sure everyone will miss me. for a few months. it's better than living the rest of my life wanting to die and making everyone around me regret knowing me. 
how can people say they would miss me if i died but then ignore me for days/weeks/months at a time?
i'm beginning to think it's just them covering their asses. no one is going to tell a suicidal person they wouldn't miss them.
is feeling suicidal enough of a reason to call in sick to work?
i'm sitting on the platform waiting for my train to arrive and i'm just fed up with finding ways to breath in a world that is drowning me. i dont want to go into work, if someone is aggressive or just not positive in anyway to me today, i'm gonna break down, i'm already on the brink anyway, even the slight wind feels like its pushing me towards the track. what i real need is to lie in bed and have my boyfriend cuddle me and do the things he does that makes my life feel a little less of a daily fight for my life, i think i that would make me feel better, rather than sit in an aggressive workplace for the next 8 hours, only to come home for 5 hours sleep and do another 8 hours.
man i fucking hate birthdays
sitting alone in my dorm room on my 20th birthday wishing i were dead. thank you to the two people who said happy birthday, that was cool.edit: i never expected this post to gain so much traction, thank you guys so much for all the responses. they might’ve been from a bunch of random internet strangers but goddamn it meant a lot. to everyone out there who feels the same, i promise you, we’ll get thru this fucking bullshit and finally be happy someday. until then tho, all we got is each other so thank you guys for that.
nobody cares until someone's dead.
if only i knew, i would've talked to them   the world loves you     you have worth    you're irreplacable    all bullshit.  funny how this only comes around after a suicide,  but quickly fades away.
something clicked
i've been having suicidal thoughts for the past couple year and severe depression. i work in a pub kitchen and today i realised something, i'm really good at what i do and i'm valued in my team. and i had this moment of happiness and i felt great, just to know that in one aspect in my life i'm not totally useless is amazing. i had to get this off my chest, even if nobody reads it.edit: after reading the responses you all gave me i genuinely cried, i've never opened up about these kind of things and to have complete strangers reply the way you all did makes me really hopeful, thank you all for the support! to care about a stranger on the internet who you know nothing about shows everything about your character, you are all amazing people and if ever you are feeling down i'm always here to talk. i will never forget that kindness you've all shown me, whenever i'm down i will think about how much of you cared about me. thank you!
update on pm trolls, self-appointed enforcers, and sw moderation practices. if you got a pm that was abusive or critical, please read, thx!
thanks to assistance from the reddit admins and the protective action of our previous warning, we're glad to say that reports of pm trolling have tapered off. we appreciate the help of everyone in the community who made the extra effort to report these pms and send us their contents.however, we've also been seeing another disturbing pattern: someone (or some people, although we suspect one person using many accounts) taking it upon themselves to police the sub, without consulting us, by sending people pms with harsh criticisms of their responses. in the cases that have been reported to us, we've been dismayed to see that the content of these messages contain serious misinterpretations of our guidelines, and are in complete conflict with our moderation philosophy.if you get a pm that criticizes your responses to our ops, please be aware that if it doesn't come from /r/suicidewatch, it's probably giving you wrong and harmful feedback. please **[send us a modmail with the text of the pm and the account from his the message originated](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsuicidewatch)**, click report on the pm, and don't worry about it unless we contact you. please do ***not*** post the account name in this thread or anywhere else. the sw mod team does occasionally give private feedback to commenters who are generally doing well but need clarification on some specific issues, but these notes will always come from the subreddit's mailbox and never from an individual. our sincere thanks to everyone who shares their time, energy, strength, and wisdom supporting our ops. edit:  clarified details.
last night i posted my suicide letter, but thanks to you guys, i'm still here the next day. i'm so glad i am, too.
many of you gave me lots of words of encouragement, and sent private messages, which absolutely helped me a little bit. i will not say i feel 100% better, i still today am struggling with the same suicidal and self hatred feelings, but i am still alive and that's something.one of you gave the advice to focus more on myself, and that's exactly what i did today. i woke up, crying from the fact that i woke up and was still alive... then decided you know what? fuck this. if i'm stuck here one more day, i'm gonna make it great. and you know what? i did.i immediately went to an apartment viewing that was semi spontaneous... turns out the apartment is literally perfect for me in absolutely every way. they even have a private fenced backyard and encourage dogs... which would help with my depression. it is perfect. i am signing a lease this weekend and moving out of my mom's house. huge step towards a new life.then this afternoon, i got a call from a job and they wanted me to come right in for an interview. i got offered a job on the spot and i start tomorrow. he said i seem perfect for the job. this is going to help my money situation as well as keep me busy and occupied when i get depressed.then when i came home, my boyfriend (who didn't know of my feelings last night) called me asking to take me on a in-home date including him grilling dinner and us watching a movie and me sleeping over.if you guys hadn't have put so much effort in keeping me alive last night, none of these things would have happened. i can't say thank you enough. again, like i said, i'm still dealing with a lot of issues and its going to take time, but since i didn't off myself last night, i feel like the universe showed me today that yes, you have the opportunity to have good things happen to you if you just stay here. again, thanks so much to all of you. i cross my fingers that these new developments will help encourage me to stay alive just a little bit longer.i love you all.
given some people’s circumstances, i think suicide is logical
like, i’m a lazy piece of shit. not really depressed but i think life just ain’t worth it, besides all the happy stuff of course :) however, we’ll spend the majority of our lives being stressed out about money, we will witness the pain of losing our parents one day eventually and even friends and other family along the way. we’re born into a world we did not ask to be born into and thrown into the heap of it. get a job they say. yes, i’ll get a job that i’m not really that satisfied with and only be in it for the money because i like not starving :d go to college they say. yes, i will go through college only because of societal pressure and eventually almost destroy my mental stability as i scorch through exam after exam, so i can be hired by someone only to do the same thing. you’ll have to witness not only a lot of physical pain (it will eventually happen) but mental pain and stress, which takes quite a toll on you. this world is not meant for lazy and laid back people, which i think justifies me killing myself. honestly, it would be cool if life was just happy things all the time, which are honestly the only moments we live for.
i just want a fucking friend.
title. i dont know how fucking many years i've thought this. all i want in life is just a friend, but it just seems to be impossible. everyone i call my friend is just someone i know and not someone i actually talk to. i feel like i'm just gradually becoming sadder and sadder as life goes on. i still try to talk to people at school. especially the people that i don't know that well. but i really suck at it. i don't know what to do. i've basically already accepted that i'm gonna live my life alone and i'm gonna die alone. so why not die now. why should i live for another however many years being just as sad or even sadder when i can just end it now. when i can just end the suffering now. i just don't know what to do.
suicidal feelings flair up right before falling asleep?
does anyone else experience this?this happens almost every night, and i end up staying up for another hour or so crying out all my feelings. i get violent suicidal thoughts and it takes immense mental strength to not give into these feelings of despair.similarly, i experience these feelings right when i wake up. i’ve never been able to pin point a logical reason behind this, and i wish i knew how to stop them. it gets really hard trying to fall asleep while simultaneously experiencing indescribable emotions.
i'm hanging myself from a bridge tonight.
i've been thinking about killing myself for years. i've even tried a few times, but none of my attempts have ever worked. last night, i took a mixture of pills in an attempt to overdose and woke up a few hours later to throw them all up. i think i'm almost done with my body trying to get everything out of me, but i still wish i would've died. that's why i'm trying again tonight. i dont see any hope for me or for getting better. i lost my job, my money, my family, my car, i'm in a court case facing six years in prison, and my only friend who i trust is being pulled away from me because his girlfriend is jealous of me. i have nothing and no one left except my depression and anxiety. i honestly dont want to keep trying. even if there was something i could do at this point to change things or fix things, i dont know if i'd do it. i kind of just want things to be over. i dont want to try anymore. i'm going to hang myself tonight. never tried this method of suicide before so i'm hoping it works because i dont want to keep suffering anymore. i just want to be dead.
the only reason i haven’t killed my self is because i know how badly it will hurt my mom.
i don’t even feel like a person anymore; i’ve lost myself, my personality. i’m going to buy a gun today and think about it some more. i’ve already attempted suicide by overdosing and hanging, and was hospitalized for it. i have therapists and med providers. i work two jobs to keep myself busy and out of financial trouble. everyone tells me i am young and beautiful and have so much potential, but i’ve honestly never truly enjoyed life except for this past year with my so. i became a different person and came out of my shell and made so many memories and had so many experiences. he abandoned me (i have ptsd from abandonment from my father and a few other friendships and relationships). i cannot handle another abandonment. and if it isn’t him it will be someone else down the road. i want to call my mom one last time and tell her i love her and i’m sorry. i am so lost.
whenever i think about the future, i just want to kill myself
or just life in general. i don't have enough courage or brains to actually become good at something. imagining being recognized for my work makes me want to kill myself too, or being successful in any capacity. i think it's because i can't handle being so vulnerable to other people. i don't want them to see my work. i don't want them to comment on it or my worth. i just wish everyone else would just disappear. &#x200b;
crying doesn't mean you're weak, it just means you've been strong for too long.
carry on, friend! :) 
i don't wanna kill myself, i just wish i was never born.

born to kill myself
anyone feel like they were born to eventually kill themeselves? im not sure if im depressed but all i can ever think about is how much i want to put a rope around my neck. not fond of people, i feel more alone when im with people. only 2 friends who hangout with me out of pitty. not sure why i shouldnt kill myself. 
is it bizarre to find comfort in the fact that i could kill myself whenever i want?
i have guns at my home. i've debated killing myself for years now. i generally find something to grasp on to and stay alive for months at a time, and when that's done or things get worse it's all i think about. in a way, pondering how i'd do it, who i'd write letters to, etc is almost therapeutic. i know that if thinhs get even worse, i can just end it all.i don't know if this makes a whole lot of sense, but it's how i feel. and i feel like it'll be either before the new year or within the next 3 or 4 years. i have no reason to be sad, but i just am. all the time.
my mom cried in front of me after staying in my bed for 4 days straight
that was the worst thing that i ever saw.  i realize the impact of killing myself on others and how much my mom loves me.  like i am still struggling, but she keeps me going.
i skipped school today.
hi.my depression has been very bad the past few months. since i don't have health insurance at the moment, i can't go back to therapy. i was going before but my case was dropped because i missed too many session, and i hate myself now for being so forgetful about them.i managed to stay home from school today, and since i was alone at home i thought it would be a good chance for me to end my life. why? i just woke up feeling suicidal is all. there are days where i just want to end it all, and then days where i feel fine and actually want to do things with my life. its been going on for years. at this point in very tired of it.i spent the last three hours crying in the bathroom with my dad's utility knife, contemplating and hoping to god that no one would come back home and find me there. i eventually just ended up hopping onto reddit and going through this subreddit to see if anyone could help me out. reading through all the old posts here, it helped me calm down and put the knife away in the closet. so many posts of people deciding not to do it, comments that offered support, it made me feel like someone out there really did care. even if i've never really talked to anyone here. that isn't weird, right? i hope not. my mom came back home and scolded me again for not going to school, which usually makes my mood worse, but this time it actually helped make me feel a bit better. for today, she wouldn't have to worry about coming back home to her daughter's dead body.i'm in my room now, curled up in bed with my blankets and my teddy bear. ((that's embarrassing to say, but its a special bear for me.)) it's very cold today. the weather has been weird here in ny, but i'm glad that the fall is starting to actually feel like fall for once.today was not the day for me to off myself. thankfully, i managed to calm down and actually managed to feel better, even if it was just a little bit. hopefully, there will never be a day where i actually do off myself. i don't want to die knowing that i'll probably regret it when it's too late.i can't promise that i won't do this again, but i do promise that i'll go to school tomorrow. thank you for reading, and thank you for existing.
ever look up people you used to be closed to and see how well they're doing and then want to jump off a building cause your life if f***ed?
made that mistake tonight and i feel like my life is genuinely worthless... i could have been so much more i feel...instead, i get to go thru manic episodes and depression that's trying to kill me...i really should just get it over with. i know i should. dragging out this meaningless existence is like keeping my hand pressed down in a pot of boiling oil. it fucking hurts.my suicide will come as a shock to no one. no one at all. 
passive suicide
i want to die, but i don't want to attempt suicide again. i'll end up vomiting all over the place again or end up being in pain again, so i'm just waiting to die. i'm going to slowly wind down on eating, moving, and whatnot. i'm just going to smoke and vape until i eventually die from something. i've also come down with a respiratory infection, so there's that. i'm just really bored and tired of living life. nothing's interesting. nothing's exciting. nothing makes me happy. family's getting on my goddamn nerves with bullshit. i don't want any more friends or romantic partners. i just want to quit being present.
i....
*i was planning my suicide for this friday, the 21st. i prepared since wednesday cleaning, organizing, fasting, and gathering up materials for a hanging. i however decided not to go through with it. i made notes to every person in my life that i care deeply for, as well as a suicide note addressed to anyone who would read it. i then made 450 hand written notes to everyone in my senior class, and as i was creating them i had a lot of time to think. i realized that i should wait. all the notes i wrote to those closest to me showed me how much i matter in their lives and how my absence would affect them deeply. even if i don't really understand that now i think i will come to my senses eventually. this feeling of wanting my existence to end prematurely is something i will never get rid of, i'm just not going to act on it for the sake of others. my thought is to wait for the new year and if by that time if i'm still ready to leave, i will go. my notes and everything else are prepared so i will wait. i will wait until 010919. then my time will come, and i will embrace my transition wholeheartedly. thank you for listening. :)*
i just tried to kill myself
so i just came out of the bathroom. i tried to cut my wrist like in the movies but my razor was not sharp enough and i just have a few deep scratches. my cat was outside the bathroom calling for me so i opened the door for her and she was so sweet and innocent..  i dont want her aloneim feeling really calm now, i think is for the blood pressure. i dont now what to do now. i dont wanna die anymore. i want to hide everything and forget this but i have now marks in my wrist. i have thrown the razor and cleaned the blood but im afraid someone will notice something, i dont wanna hurt anyone. how do i hide everything? 
my wife has been googling painless suicide methods
my wife and i have been through a lot in the last 5 years. her brother committed suicide in 2012, and we have struggled with infertility, finally giving up. she's often depressed, binge-watching netflix in bed on her days off; this is especially bad when she has her periods which have gotten worse as well.she has her period right now. this morning i got worried about her mental state. she never answers questions about it honestly--will never own up to being suicidal, in particular, though i know she has thought about suicide in the past. i looked through her browser history and found this sequence:* searches for 1-bedroom apartments in our area* searches for how to get out of a bad marriage* searches for how to stop suicidal thoughts* searches for painless suicide methods* a visit to her dead brother's facebook pagethis scared the shit out of me. i am afraid if i confront her about it she will run away from me. i don't know what to do. she adamantly refuses to go to therapy--she works in healthcare and says therapists are worthless. she has access to powerful drugs through work--she works in a trauma icu where people often die.
i wish i could take away an innocent child's cancer and transfer it into myself instead.
that kid doesn't deserve to go through such suffering at such a young age, they don't deserve the physical pain and they probably don't even understand the emotional pain being caused by their affliction. no child should have to go through something like that, no kid should be told they're going to die soon and they have to stop playing with their friends and watching their favourite cartoons. i deserve the affliction, i want it. if i were told i'm going to die in 6 months, it wouldn't matter. i have no friends, my family don't really care about me and i'm unable to achieve any of my hopes and dreams. my death would not effect a single person. i'm sorry if this post sounds insensitive but i would be happy if i was diagnosed with a terminal illness because that way i would easily be able to leave this earth and i'd be guaranteed to die. suicide is a hard step to take because your body and brain are fighting to keep you alive and there isn't a lot of guarantee that you'll actually die, with terminal illness you know you will die soon.
update: i’m still here
i posted on here 8 days ago saying i was going to kill myself the next day. i tried to. i took a lot of pills and spent the next 12 hours vomiting charcoal and chocolate milk every half hour. every time i was well enough to speak i was crying and saying “i don’t wanna die” or “i’m a fucking idiot this was a terrible idea”. i then spent five days in an inpatient behavioral health center for kids and adolescents, which only helped me because i was away. i took a break from everything, just like i wanted.i got out thursday morning. i graduated high school on friday. i’m still the same person i was before, just without the luxury of thinking about killing myself. family is mostly the same. i still don’t have many friends, and those that i do have i’m not allowed to see. but i’m okay, i think.
if someone from my life recognized i was in pain that would mean a lot.
they don't even have to help me.
i read a poem today.
it hit me hard. it made me want to live for a little while. half an hour isn't long, but i thought it'd be worth posting just in case if it helps anyone else out there: the morning after i killed myself, i woke up.i made myself breakfast in bed.i added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. i squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. i scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. i washed the dishes and folded the towels.the morning after i killed myself, i fell in love. not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. i fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. i fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. with my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe i still existed.the morning after i killed myself, i walked the dog. i watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. i saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. i stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.the morning after i killed myself, i went back to the neighbors’ yard where i left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. i picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. i saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.the morning after i killed myself, i watched the sun come up. each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.the morning after i killed myself, i went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. i told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. i told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.the morning after i killed myself, i tried to unkill myself, but couldn’t finish what i started.by meggie royer
to the 16 year old sophmore who deleted their post, i'm sorry i didn't respond fast enough i got carried away and started writing you a novel. 
if you still want to talk i'm stepping out for a few but i'll be back and probably be on all night.  please don't give up, i'll do my best to give you the concise version of what i wrote if you want it.  you still have so much life to live.
i wish someone had told me this sooner. 

i wish no one knew me so i wouldn’t have to stay here anymore

wouldn’t it be lovely?
wouldn’t it be lovely to live a nice, neat life. to wake up and feel good about the day ahead. to make the bed well, tucking the clean linen sheets under the mattress and gently arranging the pillows. to write an achievable list of tasks to finish and follow them through to completion without panic attacks and tears. to cook a healthy meal and not feel bad about eating it. to work well and produce admirable results. to be a person that others like, maybe even love. to be beautiful and slender, clean and sweet-smelling. to be highly intelligent. to have been accepted into an excellent university, received excellent grades, and to be working in an excellent career. to be proud of yourself for once.i hate myself. i wish i was anybody else. i wish i could escape.
my life was just saved my comedy
short story short, i was caught making a very bad decision and was punished and humiliated. had the most extreme panic attack and depersonalization i’ve ever had and looked for a gun to end it all with in my dad’s closet.i find this case, i bring it over to the bed, it has memory foam like a gun case and a piece of cloth covering the contents. i pull away the cloth expecting to find the tool i would use to end my life.i found sex toys. i laughed so hard that i was completely grounded (in reality) and decided that today is not my day. i was super grossed out, but man is this gonna make one heck of a story. not sure why i’m even posting this, but i had to tell someone about it.
i would 100% attempt suicide if i knew there were no health risks for failure

i’m departing this world in 3 hours.
i’ve made the decision to leave in 3 hours. i’ve been through a countless amount of emotional torture and stress. i’m in constant depression and i’m suicidal. i have anxiety and i can’t deal with life for one more day. i’m a 20 year old male, i don’t know where i’m going or what i’m doing. i feel like this is the most humane thing. i wish all of you on here a recovery and happiness. depression is a horrible thing and no one should have to suffer with it. i love all of you and have so much respect for all of you because we are all battling the same thing and we all know how hard it is for eachother. we are almost a family here. to all the people that continue to battle it, i respect all of you. for me, i have lost this battle.thank you all,much love,m.
my gun misfired tonight
long story but my gum misfired and i'm still alive..i drove home from my military base to see my ma. i see her almost every weekend as she is 3 hours from my base. i always carry my pistol with me ever since my brother got robbed at his hotel. i got home, and everyone was asleep. my family doesn't know that i've had suicidal ideology for almost all my life. 3 years ago i tried to hang myself in japan but my belt broke and i vowed to never try again. when i got home i started to drink heavily to get rid of the pain but the pain overtook so i started my letter. i told my ma i was sorry for destroying what she brought into this word. i told my step dad he treated my ma right. i told my 21 year old brother and my 16 year old sister that i'm sorry that i put them through this. what broke me the most on this letter was telling my 6 year old brother that i'm sorry i left him. i told him i would miss all the times we played video games together. i told him i'm sorry i won't be able to take him to the playground ever again. and i told him i'm sorry he never got to know me as his biggest brother. i'm the oldest of all siblings at 24. once i finished my letter i placed it on my bed that my ma never got rid of it whenever i left for boot camp. i took my glock 23 and walked out to my front porch. smoked my last cigarette, drank my last drink. and put the pistol to my head. for about 30 seconds i waited to see if this was what i wanted. after those thirty seconds i pulled the trigger.there was a click.  there was not a round in the chamber so my glock dry fired. i immediately puked and cried for about 30 mins at 2 in the morning. since then i've sobered up ripped the note to shreds and hit my pistol in my car and put my keys in the living room. tonight was the closet i've come to death minus combat while deployed. death at my own hands. i don't know what to do next.
i killed someone driving drunk, the only way i see out is killing myself
a few weeks ago i killed someone in a crash while i was driving drunk.the blood test results aren't back yet, but i know i'm going to be over... there was also weed in my car, and empty beer cans.i can't stand living with the shame of this... what i did to this girl and her family, and what i'm putting my family through.i don't know if there's any reason for me to keep going.  i have a .44 magnum and i had it in my mouth earlier, but couldn't pull the trigger just yet... but i know i'm going to eventually.i don't see any point in going on with life.  i took someone else's life in a stupid selfish act, it only seems fair.i can't make my family go through a year or more of legal battles over this, to only go to jail for 10+ years.  that's not fair to them, and we aren't rich and it would basically bankrupt the family.is there any point in going on?  all signs say suicide is the best option.  make the other family happy that i'm gone (or they at least feel like they got justice), save my family financial future, and end my own mental suffering both from the knowledge i killed someone and the unknown that is coming for me.
it's tiring hating yourself all the time

my teenage son killed himself.
my 16 year old son took his own life 10 days ago. we had an idea that he might be struggling with depression and we were waiting too see a couple doctors. we had no idea that he was this bad. he left my wife and i plus i have two girls at the grade school age. my wife and my 11 year old are the ones who found him. we have had the services and family and friends have been very supportive. that being said we still cant function  on a daily basis we are drowning in grief. this seems like it's destroyed my whole family. everyday and everything just seems so pointless. i have no idea where to turn for help. man , do we need it.

it's not worth it if i have to be attracted to other guys
original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/gajsy/i_wish_i_didnt_have_these_attractions/so i took some of the comment's advice. i chilled out and met a guy who wanted to hook up. when i got back to my dorm, i had already been feeling a bit sick, that coupled with the fact that i was thoroughly disgusted with myself for enjoying hooking up with another guy made me throw up. i spent the next twenty minutes punching my concrete wall so hard my knuckles started to bleed.i can't do this, i don't want to live anymore if it means i have to be gay. it makes me physically ill to my stomach if what society's telling me is true: i can't change this. i don't want to be gay more than anything else in the world, i would be okay with being bi, hell, even lying about it would be better. everyone keeps telling me it would be wrong to get in a relationship with a girl if no sexual attraction was there and if i can't even do that, i don't want to live anymore.society would accept me, my friends would all accept me, but they would never treat me the same again. my parents are convinced that homosexuality doesn't exist, that its all based on environment and upbringing, they wouldn't hate me or throw me out, in fact they're the least of my concerns.its me mainly, i don't want to be gay. i tried it and it made me sick at my stomach, i hate everything about it from the culture to the fact that i can't live my dream of being married to a beautiful wife with children without somehow being a bad person. i won't accept this, i don't give a shit if you call it self-hatred. i talked to a suicide hotline, they basically talked me out of it and told me the same thing as everyone else, you can't help it. i talked to a guy at our school's lgbt support center, he also said i have no choice in the matter. if this is truly the case then i'm done, fuck it. i will not live my life being gay and i will not live my life celibate.edit: i know this is cliche as hell, but i wanna thank everyone for the encouragement. after about half an hour of reading comments i ran over to the gym for a quick workout sesh and i already feel loads better. for now i'm not gonna worry about it anymore, if suicide is an option, as one of you pointed out, i have a self-determined amount of time before that to do whatever the fuck i want to find out who i am. on top of that, purple_antwerp's words really made me realize that i need to man the fuck up and not label myself so i can really find out who i am. seeing as i'm not an atheist, liberal, or an introvert, its times like these that really make me truly appreciate reddit.
i don't want to be happy or get better. i just want to go back to being non existent.
fuck everything about life. i don't want any fucking part of it. i don't give a shit about my parents, i wish i was aborted. just euthanize instead of forcing me to fucking suffer.
i hate my brain for putting me through this
it’s not fair. when most people are in a situation like mine they’re sad and they do their best to get out...and that’s it. there’s no voice in their head spewing a constant stream of “kill yourself. you’re an idiot. die.” it’s not fair. i’m tired of hearing “it’ll get better.” it’s been years. i want it to end now i’m exhausted. why is it so fucking unfair. ugh sorry for the rant
anyone else more afraid of failure than death?
exactly as it sounds. i'm much more afraid of failing + living with consequences (ex. permant injury) + ppl being upset with me than dying.
always funny how people claim to care about you
then they just start acting like you don't even existsorry i'm not important enough for you
i swear to god if one more person tells me to volunteer after opening up about my suicidal thoughts i’m going to shoot myself and hope they get splattered
i get it, i put on a good f*cking facade, people probably think i’m just being full of myself. i don’t open up to people but the few times i have (suicide hotline, er) i get this advice. i get it, for someone who is just down in the dumps volunteering is awesome but for someone who constantly gives their all to other people it’s bullsh*t. its like their last attempt at helping once they’ve gone through the list of things i’ve already fucking tried. guess what, i have volunteered and i hated it it felt forced and i already have a hard time doing anything for myself so spending what little i have on more people makes me incredibly depressed. 
progress is progress
it's 3 days in 2020 and i haven't touched a razor blade when i felt the need to.progress is progress.
i think my wife is killing herself tonight
this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. my wife (33) has been suicidal for most of her life (her first attempt was at 8 years old). she told me when i first met her almost 8 years ago that she didn't plan to live very long, and knowing that full well i chose to be with her anyway. at that time she said she was waiting until her beloved dog passed away (she was already like 15 at that time) because she (my wife) didn't want to leave her elderly dog alone without her. well that day came and went, it was a hard time but she was able to pull though, mostly for me. well her mental disorders have been getting way worse. she had ocd and anxiety so bad that she has not been able to sit in a chair for over three years (she has to always be standing or laying down). well about two weeks ago her disorders took her ability to sleep, so she has not gotten more than 2 hours of sleep a night. she has hated living for so long now. she tells me that she is only staying alive for me, and if it wasn't for me, she would have killed herself a long time ago.  and yes, she has been getting treatment, she's been seeing a therapist and doctors for years and taking all the meds they give her and doing all the things they tell her, but nothing has helped at all.&#x200b;ever since i've known her she has had a kit containing supplies to do the job. she says it makes her feel better to know that it's there if she needs it. &#x200b;today is the anniversary of her mothers death (8 years ago). she told me that she can't do this anymore, this world is too hard for her. i already knew that, i have been expecting this for a long time. i held her, and we cried together for hours, she told me how sorry she was, and i told her how much i love her and will always love her.&#x200b; she drove away and i didn't stop her. &#x200b;i wanted to stop her, i wanted to hide her car keys, or throw away her kit. but i love her, and i see every day how miserable she is. she is in 24/7 pain, both physically and mentally. if i stopped her, it would be only because i am selfish and want her to stay here for me. &#x200b;i am praying so hard that she changes her mind and i get even one more day with her, but i don't know if that will happen. &#x200b;i feel so dead inside right now, i love her, so i don't want to ever be away from her, but i also love her, so i don't want her to suffer anymore. &#x200b;i don't expect anyone to read this, and it may get deleted but i needed to tell someone, i can't tell anyone else.&#x200b;tldr: my wife has been suffering so long that every moment of her life is misery. i could have stopped her but i didn't, so she drove away, with the tools she needs to end her life. i hope she comes back, but i also hope she finds peace.
i'd rather be happy than die
but i'd rather die than feel like this
for you :)

i don't want to kill myself. i just want to die... because then nothing will be my problem anymore.
seriously. i'm just kind of sitting at my desk at work and dissociating, imagining how much of a relief it would be if this city just suddenly became the epicenter of a nuclear blast or something. i wouldn't even have time to say byeeeee, bitches, before becoming a vaporized cloud of atoms floating up, up, and away on the mushroom cloud. hell, my parents wouldn't even have to arrange for a funeral or anything, because by the time they heard about it, the entire west coast would be a smoldering crater.like, fuck. wouldn't that be nice? wouldn't it be nice, not to be lonely all the time?wouldn't it be nice, not to be excited to finally meet someone from tinder, and then find out they ghosted you after you show up for the date?wouldn't it be nice, not to have to stress about being forever alone?wouldn't it be nice, not to worry about having been damaged goods since childhood?wouldn't it be nice, never to hear another therapist spew syrupy platitudes like they'll change the past?wouldn't it be nice, not to worry about making enough money to afford to exist... so that you can make more money?wouldn't it be nice, not to watch everyone i used to interact with have lucky breaks and see all their hard work pay off, while life takes me out back for a fucking curb party?wouldn't it be nice, just to be free - truly free - and not have to make the choice?i wish i could just vanish. this world is no place for someone like me.
thank you
never thought i myself would be on that precipice. i texted the hotline from the sidebar... just talking helped. even though i didn't really say much... the distraction was what i needed.i pulled back. i changed my tire. i'm waiting on it to be replaced. i dried my tears. i told those that i love thank you for being there even though i never reached out.. i know they are there.i have a fresh perspective. i was close. i was really close. i've never been so scared.. so alone.but stephanie was there. i wasn't alone.i'm still afraid of what's ahead.. but i'm ready to face it.i'm ready to live.
i wanted to end my life when i was 13 but i didn't because everyone told me it gets better. i am now 38 and my life has been just as miserable and as pointless as i knew it would be.
i consider not having killed myself back when i felt passionate enough to do something about my suffering as the worst decision in a life filled with disappointment and failure. i'm tired. i'm old enough to see what the next handful of years will hold and i'm not that interested in participating. i feel like everyone has just spouted the same contrived platitudes without considering that i might actually know what i'm talking about. 
i'm 16, and selling my body for a living.
i dont know what to write or what the fucking point is. i'm 16, my parents died and i got into foster care. which was worst. the damn people i was with were demons. i now live by myself in a major city. selling my body which makes me feel disgusting and terrible. i've gotten raped and abused a million times and i am losing my will to keep on going. i had a bright future going for me, but im not gonna talk about that because i dont fucking care anymore. i'm tired of struggling to live day by day and getting fucked over and used.i got myself an apartment, so i dont live on the streets now. but the person that bought it for me comes every night, forces me to do sexual stuff on him and leaves. and im here alone. by my fucking self.im tired of this. i'm tired of all the struggles. i'm just so fucking tired. i feel so alone in the world, i feel so filthy and disgusting.i just need a friend to get me through tonight because lately ive just been getting overwhelmed.i need someone to talk to or i might kill myself. i'm just mentally and psychically and emotionally drained. and i know that makes me weak. but im tired of doing my best just to get by. i dont know what to do anymore. if anyone has skype, kik, anything. i just need a friend because im on the verge of ending it. edit: thank you for all of the support.
does anyone else wonder, or think about what others, particularly your loved ones, would say or do if you died?
i think about this quite often.
colleges like to act that they care about your mental health, but they don't really care until bodies start falling.
i've been trying to get academic help from my school based on depression/suicidal ideation for like 6 weeks now, but it seems like administrators and professors don't deem my problems serious enough. i've been hanging on a ledge for god knows how long, but none of these fuckers understand or even care. christ
does anyone fucking hate it when you have to fake every fucking thing about you to fucking hide your fucking depressed self.
i'm fucking done, i just want to fucking die again, i  even thought i was fucking healing but no it's getting fucking worse, i'm gonna wait think i'm in college to actually kill myself, so there is no way someone will stop me.
what the fuck is the help people always tell you to get?
therapy is a joke and medication is artificial happiness. i mean honestly, i don't want a therapist, i just want a friend. i'm not staying on this grind for no reason and it seems illogical to suggest doing so.
i wish someone would kill me or run me over with a truck so no one would have to live with the fact that i killed myself.
i've attempted twice. been hospitalized once. i just want to die. i feel like i'm in constant pain. i don't have health insurance right now (worst timing) so i can't go to a hospital to try to get help. i just don't want my boyfriend to find me or for my parents to blame themselves. that's the only reason i'm alive.i have a plan and everything.
that tearing feeling you get in your chest right before you cry yourself to sleep

i want to die before i turn 30
my birthday is in january. i want to die before my birthday. i dont want to be 30. the age gets to me. my life is shit. i have no friends and everyone who's ever loved me doesnt really respect me. i dont respect my self. i might just cut tonight. but before my birthday i have a plan. i dont think i can give details in this sub but it's nearly painless and nearly foolproof and easy. i just needed to let someone know. i've already made my list of things to do before hand, like a bucket list and they're all checked off except finishing up the writing. i've waited more than 30 days. hell, i've waited years. it would have been easier of i had actually just done it when i was 13 like i wanted. i dont want to live another 30 years in this way. i feel trapped. trapped. theres some part of me that doesnt want to give up but that gets crushed a little more everyday. i'm very close to the breaking point. at least at the end my thoughts will be known. i've done video blogs to document my declining mental state and my profound sadness. i'm writing letters. no one will need an explanation, they all know i'm suffering they just choose to remain unaware. the blog may give some comfort to those that blame themselves. it's really no ones fault but a failure of society as a collective. 
fuck
i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die
everyone always tells me that it will get better and you’ll be happy someday. that’s a fucking lie. i want to die because family doesn’t mean anything anymore, friends are backstabbers, i’m a guy and when i cry i’m seen as week. so nothing matters in this world. please someone help me. i’m lost.

life is pointless and nothing really matters
no matter how successful you are, once you're dead nothing matters anymore. you will lose all your memories and achievements so why would you even put effort in anything in the first place?it doesn't matter if you are alive right now or not, it doesn't matter how much you achieve in your pathetic  and meaningless life. when you die you go back to the same state of nonexistence as you were in before you were born. humans are just biological robots with 2 arms and 2 legs and there is no such thing as a soul or a spirit. our emotions are just chemical reactions in our brain. wer are literally just a bunch of atoms. we live in the delusion that our life actually has a meaning and that everything happens for a reason. once you are dead it will be as if you never existed. all the happy moments in your life, all your achievements and everything you ever did will be gone forever. less than 100 years after your death nobody is going to remember that you ever existed.some people say you will live on in your loved one's memories. but all the people in your life that mattered to you will die too and stop existing. things don't matter to you because of a meaning in life but because of the chemical reactions in your brain. some people think they are better or more important than others because they are richer or more successful, but they're not. everyone's life is equally pointless.i don't care if anyone reads this. i just wanted to get it off my chest.
everyone loves to say get help but no one has anything to say when the help doesn't do anything to help.
i've seen therapists, multiple doctors, tried more meds than i can count, and my life has only gotten worse. get help, reach out... well i fucking did that, now what. i'm expected to exist in this indefinitely miserable state until i'm lucky enough that something kills me, such bullshit. i guess i'll abuse drugs/alcohol for as long as i can. probably should have done that in the first place, would have saved me a lot of stress and anxiety. if it wasn't for my pets i wouldn't see tomorrow, not sure how long my pets will be able to delay the inevitable. shit is just hopeless.
anyone scared to kill themselves because of the possibility of an afterlife?

i decided to not to die. thanks /r/suicidewatch

if i kill my self i’ll be dead so why should i care if other people are hurt my my death.
this sounds really selfish and i hate it but i’ll be dead, so why should i care if others are hurt by my death, right?
i attempted suicide and spent a week in an inpatient psych hospital.
a few of you might have seen my post last week about having pills and alcohol and wanting to die. long story short, i didn't die, and i spent one week in an inpatient psychiatric facility with group therapy, regulated meal and break times, and strictly regulated possessions (no phones, shoelaces, plastic bags, or razors were anywhere accessible to patients.) it was the best week of my life.-connecting with people who legitimately understand and can commiserate in my struggles was one of the greatest feelings in the world. in short, i felt alive for the first time in years. the compassion and genuineness in even the most reserved, unkempt, or uninviting individuals opened my eyes to the true significance and meaning in human life. the sheer determination and will of some patients was beyond inspiring, the almost carbon-copy similarities between my story and others' was overwhelmingly soothing, and the guided discussion helped reopen and readdress issues previously long buried. -the people i met in the facility are some that i will never forget. the passionate frustration turned spiritual focus of an older gentleman in and out of prison and homelessness, the reserved kindness in an abused young lady, and the boisterous humor and wheezing laugh of a grandmotherly recovering addict will resonate with me in the years to come. i am in sheer awe and overwhelmed by the passion, the heartfelt connections, and the lasting impressions that a mere seven days has done for me. i finally see the future in a hopeful light, and am ready to face the challenges of reformation, coping, and living. -i want to thank the users here that urged me not to follow through with my plan, even though i ignored their care and worry, and i would like to urge you to watch the movie short term 12 for one of the most accurate depictions of the raw appreciation for the value of human life that comes from staying in an inpatient facility. (the movie is about minors, but rings true for the adult side as well.) sorry for the wall of text, i just wanted to express the appreciation i have for the experiences that have led me to a path of recovery.
i’m officially leaving this subreddit
after years of suffering with depression and suicidal thoughts, i finally am in a really good place going into the new year. i feel that my life has purpose, and i fell so motivated. i have no idea if this feeling will last or for how long, but i am going to try to put forth effort into preserving as long as i can in 2020.y’all are the most supportive community i’ve ever encountered on the internet, and i wish the best for each and every one of you, whatever that might entail. stay strong guys. happy new year!goodbye!
i wish my parents didn't love me so i could kill myself in peace

proud of myself
i’m proud of myself. last night i had a really shitty night. i normally cope by cutting, but i didn’t cut last night.
i wish i could die in a terrible accident so that i don't have to end my life by committing a suicide
i just have to write something. anything. it's all that's left to do. i don't know where my thoughts are going and it's going to be so inconsistent but i just have to somehow let it out or i'll explode.i hate everything. i'm 22 and my life has been a trainwreck even since i was a teenager. i'm falling and there's nothing to hold on to. i feel like i'm moving at the speed of light and i'm just about to hit the wall and crash into a million pieces.i'm so alone, so scared, so anxious about everything. it's my last year of the university and i only need to write my bachelor thesis which i haven't started and the deadline is may 23. i'm working 40 per week in a new job for two months and i'm feeling like an alien there. i don't know what i'm doing, i'm feeling worthless, helpless and stupid. i'm so exhausted that i just come back home from work and just lay in bed for hours.every person i see is a stranger. they're speaking the same language but they don't understand me and i don't understand them. sometimes 'hello' and 'goodbye' to my coworkers are the only words i say out loud throughout the day. i feel like i want to shout on top of my lungs but i can't make a sound.i don't know what love is. i haven't touched another person ever in my life. i am gay and nobody knows. nobody will ever know. i've simply distanced myself from everyone. i've isolated myself because i've been feeling insecure and scared of communication my whole life. the moment someone tries to connect with me they just see how shitty my personality is and leave. and i don't blame them.i look like a piece of trash. my hair is a mess. my body is a mess. i don't work out. i barely eat. i'm just too tired and it's just too hard.all i have is my parents. and they tell me that i should grow up, that they're doing everything they can but i still don't appreciate it, that i'm an egoist and only care about myself, that i'm enjoying being depressed, that they've had enough of me telling them that they shouldn't have made me born.my mom is the only reason i'm not killing myself yet. it will be just too painful for her. but i'm getting weaker day by day. i just don't know how much and for how long i can survive. it's all just pain. i'm weak and this life is too heavy for my thin shoulders. this life is a game i'm about to lose.
when you ask for help, then get yelled at after an attempt with “why didn’t you ask for help?”
i did. explicitly. literally hundreds of times. “i am suicidal and i could really use some support.”having a therapist is fine and good, but she’s my only friend right now. she’s the only supportive human being out of the thousands of human beings with which i’ve ever interacted. and she gets paid to be supportive, soooo... is that the only way i can get humans to care about me? i guess i’m too poor to be loved.i just want to end it. i’ve heard i could do a whole bottle of zzzquil and that’d be like falling asleep.  idk, that sounds better than something like a gun. i could pass it off as just being stupid and accidentally overdosing (my family knows i have insomnia and i sometimes take two doses to get any sleep, so it’s not that far out). i’m just so sick of going through hell and having no one. and i am mad as fuck at all the people who saw how much i was hurting and did nothing. i’ve even been blocked for asking for help/ support. so, tbh, i’m doing this because i’m angry, too. why the fuck did the adults around me just do nothing? tired of suffering. i’m not living for anything except my dog. but she’ll get over it. 
having fun before it's over. (nsfw)
about 2 days ago, i was going to kill myself. i stopped before i left my house at 2am, and decided to see if there were any last second resources. i came across reddit, and read a hilarious, yet serious post about a guy who decided to go to mexico, buy cocaine, hookers, and alcohol before he killed himself.  he had such a crazy good time, he decided life was worth living for a bit longer.i laughed and cried because i realized i never did anything like that. while i didn't get hookers and cocaine (i'm a mother of 2 children and married), i did buy a laptop and had a fantastic meal by myself (and great beer.) so, mr.cocaine and hookers...thank you for your post. i seriously was ready to off myself....but you showed me sometimes you have to do something crazy for yourself. while my version of wild good time differs, it's good to focus 100% on you for a bit. tonight i'm going to the spa, play diablo 3, and have some fun drinking. i'll find my joy in this shit hole of a world, one way or another! sick of being miserable all the time, and sick of watching my husband and kids suffer because of my mood. off to have a good time and see how it pans out. 
don't wanna keep going, don't have the guts to end it.
why do emotions have to exist? why do we live in a world full of suffering. why do we keep making the same mistakes that lead up back to depression. if only we had reptile brains but being human we've got a constant need for social connection and a wide range of emotions. we're all playing life on hard mode...  i can't bring myself to end it though. dying is easy, living is harder. inside i know i have to ride this bitter ride called life to the end. i came into this world kicking and screaming and by god i'm gonna leave it kicking and screaming. i am going the slow route of suicide, smoking and not taking care of myself and crossing my fingers that i get some kind of terminal disease so i can die and no one would blame me for going. i wish i could curl up into a ball find a cave and just sleep until it was time to die. that's all, no one has to read this post it's just a way of self expression.
i don't understand why people don't care until you try to kill yourself
as i typed that out i realized i kind of do in a way. i guess what bothers me is people put off other peoples feelings until its irreversible.i've talked with family members and co-workers about my feelings of depression and event thoughts of suicide. they've been comforting in the moment but i realize it feels shallow to me. it's not that i want people to put down everything and dedicate themselves to making me feel better or anything like that.i guess have this nagging feeling that i should kill myself and no one seems that interested in helping me find a way to deal with it. i've had heart to hearts and discussions about how to fix my problems but its hard to fix my problems on my own. ive managed to get a lot done while crying about it the whole time, sure. but i feel like living is very inconvenient and if i'm not constantly distracted or occupied by something then i feel absolutely hopeless and miserable and lonely.i've been thinking about killing myself so i can give my money to my family and i dont want people to start caring and hurting after i'm dead lol but that's been one factor that's been holding me back. my boyfriend is the only person i've told about my plan and he obviously doesn't want me to and i appreciate the thought of course. i just know the money will help everyone more than i ever could and i'd want a natural burial so it shouldnt cost much to throw my corpse in the ground. i dont want him to be sad. i really dont but we live in different countries and we don't make enough money to visit eachother regularly. its so hard to take the steps to get the paper work done so we can live together. i think itd be a lot easier on him if he had someone wealthier or even in the same country to be with. i have friends that don't i talk to (thats my fault for not keeping in touch) and family that ive tried reaching out to, but everyone has their own problems you know.i feel like itd be better for the environment and my family financially if i killed myself so i don't see any huge set back. yeah they'll be sad but i'm an adult and who cares about adults until they're dead?
i just fucking wish no one loved me
i just want to be able to go leaving no one behind
do you feel like empaths are suicidal?
correct me if i'm wrong but sometimes i feel like all people i've met that have felt suicidal share a common trait.   a lot of them are empaths who can sense a great deal of emotions and feelings in others and empathically take on the pain and distress.   though sometimes it's internal feelings, maybe the overwhelming understanding of how others feel, even if it's disappointment and resentment they take on.   for myself i felt the source of anytime i doubted my time living was taking on this pain... and i just wanted to see if anyone else felt the same or disagreed? 
i'm killing myself at the end of the week
i've tried before, failed. out of impulse maybe. they said give it a day, i did, they said give it a week, i did. they said give it a month, i did. they said give it a year, i did. i gave it time. i gave it effort. i gave it all i had. i want peace from the pain. it is my decision. thought out, getting the details in order before hand. i'm scared, i'm excited. i want my peace.
people don't give a fuck about how you feel until you actually kill yourself.
my family couldn't give a fuck about me, no one does. they say suicide doesn't end your pain, it just transfers it to your friends and family. well since i have no friends, you're damn right i want it to transfer to family. i hope it hurts them, so they know how it feels.
finally got a syringe, crushing the pills, waiting to eat my last meal.

i just wrote my suicide letter to my best friend
hey dude! what's up you lightbulb head (hehehe, i always remember that weird haircut you got once). i know this will sound like a sad joke, my bro, but, i hope you'll read this after i'm gone. i mean, like, gone. forever. if you’re reading this, i finally became the happy man you know i wanted to be.i do know you tried your best and accepted me when i came out to you as bi earlier this week. i know you told me nothing is gonna change, ever! you're a good man, i don't care who you sleep with. you put a very awkward face when you started to ask me about my male crushes and all i could say was mark wahlberg... but i liked it. you made me smile for the very first time in months that moment. i do know you had good intentions when you told me today you wanted to introduce me to one of your male friends so i could who knows?. i know i was 12 years older than you, i know all the you're so old that... jokes were in good nature (for real! every laugh was from the heart), and despite you were barely 18, you were one of the most mature and down to earth men i've ever knew in my whole and disgraceful life. i will always love you for being the kind of friend you were. you were like my real other half. you were not only my best friend, but also the little brother i always wanted to have when i was a small kid. please don't let the guys in college know the truth about my true sexuality... it was already extremely shameful to talk about that; but, i felt i had to tell you the truth before leaving this nightmare. i felt like inside a maze every single day. i had to wake up everyday feeling like i wasn't capable of deserving love, companionship, or even friends. ...and it was true. deep down. despite i had a partner (yep, a partner i never wanted to introduce you to), he just used to gave me the could shoulder (sometimes for a whole week) everytime he was so proud of himself to accept my apologizes if i did a mistake. those kind of things also used to hurt me very, very deeply.please don't blame yourself. you did everything you could, and every afternoon you made me forget everything i was living in my life: the real hell of not being able to talk about your partner. the hell of fearing that anyone could discover your true colors... the fear of feeling like a total fraud, like a failure, like a mistake, like a total error of nature. feeling that my true self was wrong. you know i wasn't a religious man, and, despite you do are one, you respected me and always talked to me about god without attempting to convert me. i always loved that. but, my dear bro, i can't take this anymore. i feel like i don't belong in anyone’s lives. i always feel like i'm the one who doesn't fit in their lives. everything feels like taken from a distant past, but twisted and destroyed with an evil intention. besides i was afraid because i didn't want to go to the doctor to check my heart... i didn't want to know if i had a health condition. if i had it, now it doesn't matter anymore. please don't blame yourself. you gave me many good afternoons, and by the way, you have one of the purest souls on this world. writing this makes me real sad, but in the end, please know that i'll be in a better place, i guess. (at least that's what people say when someone dies).remember me everytime you have a beerremember me everytime you eat chinese food (remember?)remember me everytime you listen to the birdsremember me everytime you feel the sun on your shouldersremember me everytime you feel you're without a rock to hold onremember me everytime you have an ice cream (remember the time we had a fight to be the first to get the only lemon ice cream left on the store?)remember me everytime you workout... despite you're not the sporty type. my only dreams in life were: moving out of the country, and working out. being able to have a body like wahlberg's... or at least to have a ripped body, nothing too big. i also wanted to play rugby since i can remember, but i always felt like i didn't belong there, so... i spent many times watching the people playing and saying i wish i could be him. same everytime i walked by a gym... i used to see the perfect guys lifting weights and sighing i wish i could be him. but, what was the use for? to join a gym/rugby team to be the clown? to get bullied because hey rookie, wtf are you doing here? get out after laughing so hard... just like in hs. remember me. please. remember me any time you feel you have a true friend. because, despite i'm now leaving this disaster, you will always be not only my classmate, but also my best, and only, true friend. you are an outstanding guitar player, please keep playing it. you can be a true rockstar like the ones you admire if you work hard! i was too old to see you achieving that, but, i would have loved to hear your name being chanted by a whole stadium full of fans. please, do love your dad and your stepmom. i know they're not perfect people, but, they're your parents after all. please take care of them.please, finish our major! please do a great job. please excel in anything you want to do with your life (even if that means drinking ice cold beer and that bbq with orange juice and honey i know you love!)i'll mail you this letter (the link), and my mom's phone. i know my guitar was stolen, so, i'm sorry you won't get it; but, you can take my amplifier. it's a professional one, and it's in an almost mint condition. it was my baby despite i didn't feel i had talent to play the guitar. please love my (now yours) amplifier the way i never did. you can also keep my pc. it has a ton of great games, so, you'll barely be bored. thank you, and i mean: thank you for everything. please keep being such a bright light. i love you my lil bro. too bad we weren't actually biological brothers. i will always, and i mean always will love you. and, as the poem says... don't stand up on my grave and weep. you'll look like a leaking watermelon hehehe. please don't get that haircut again. all the best. l.
i wish depression naturally caused death
okay so before anyone gets offended at what i'm about to say, just trust me when i say that i don't wish people with depression would die, but i wish that it could kill *me* naturally. yes depression does kill in the sense that it can cause suicide (and often does) but i wish that this mental illness could cause a more natural death. like for instance, if a person leaves diabetes undiagnosed, it could be fatal, as is with many other diseases and infections. why does something like depression make someone want to die mentally, but not allow them to? in a sense, it's just suffering that may end because it makes you stressed and more susceptible to certain things, but it will never end your suffering by itself. i'm gonna be honest i am in so much mental pain. i have nothing that makes me very happy anymore. i hate myself more than anything and anyone. i really want to die, but i don't want to make people grieve over me. i think eventually i might go through with it though. i have so much shit to deal with, not sure how much longer i can do this. 
my parents ok'd it.
i told my parents that despite my anti-depressants, i'm feeling suicidal. i'm in law school in a town i hate for another year, up to my ears in debt, no support from the school or anyone when it comes to preparing me to be a competitive applicant for the job i want... it's just all really overwhelming. my parents said today that clearly i'm not that dedicated to being a lawyer and if i'm not strong enough to handle this, suicide might be the best option for me because i'm not strong enough to handle life. i don't really know why i'm writing this. 
dad just found our i’m suicidal
i was on my laptop and searched “if i kill myself will my parents have to pay my student loans.” it was shitty enough finding out they’d still be on the hook for my loans. it was shittier seeing how broken i made my own father. 
my worst fear is failing at suicide
i have brain damage which is the source of my depression and nothing scares me more than attempting suicide, surviving, and leaving myself with even worse brain damage.  if i attempted suicide it would have to be something that i would be certain wouldn’t effect my brain in a failed attempt.  
it’s not that i really want to kill myself it’s that i want to be on the bridge and someone prove to me life can be enjoyable once more
it’s hitting me hard
my parents got me a stuffed animal for christmas.
i’m 14, and i’ve been collecting stuffed animals for as long as i can remember. i have hundreds. for christmas my parents got me a large cat stuffed animal. but something about this one is different. it feels comforting to be around. i can’t stop hugging and cuddling it. it makes me feel a little bit better.
i should have been aborted. no use for people like me.
i’m an ugly tranny. i’m skinny and have the body of a teen guy just going through puberty. i’ll never get the muscular body normal men have. my social skills are abysmal. my doctor told me that my social anxiety has been higher than 95% of people as i’ve gotten older. now it’s even worse. no one understands me and i try. i don’t click with people or have the same interests simply because were the same demographic. i’m not gay. i don’t care about lgbt culture. this is a curse and wish i was never lgbt. i wish i could switch places with someone from another country. i could have been killed by now while they can be here and safer. i have no talents. i’ve tried so many things for years and never got better. or i lost interest. i can’t even play computer games anymore and i used to play for hours. i have no passion in anything.i’m a virgin and will die one. no girl wants to touch a freak like me when she can get a normal guy. i’ve never been liked by a girl before and for a number of reasons. i’m just rubbish. i have no friends or family and i’m an embarrassment of a human being. i’m sorry for existing. hopefully i get hit with a metal pipe in the head one day by someone.
i tried hanging myself last night
and obviously failed. the foundation broke. i woke up in a pool of my vomit and blood. i guess from biting my tongue or something. i fucked my life up so bad yesterday.
no matter how happy i am, i always feel suicidal deep inside.
it seems like nothing can ever convince me that life is worth living. i feel like even if i had everything i've ever wanted and experienced the most immense happiness a human can ever experience, i would still choose death over life, because the pain always outweighs joy, no matter how strong the joy is. i feel so hopeless because of this. even when i'm feeling good, a tiny part of my brain keeps thinking of hurting or killing myself. i actually do the former, but obviously not the latter. i feel like my brain is entering the realm of being broken beyond repair. thoughts are already terrifying, but what's more terrifying is that i could actually carry out these thoughts. and that i enjoy the idea of not being alive anymore. i keep thinking of what to write in my suicide note. i don't know if i should be glad or sad that i don't live in a high-level apartment where death is just steps away.
who else hasn’t done it because they’re scared they will survive?
the stories about people surviving haunt me. the only thing i can imagine being worse than my reality is my reality with half of my face blown off. or my reality, but being completely paralyzed in it.i wish there was a safe and sure option to choose to check out of here. 
i think that this reddit mod is going to commit suicide and i don't know what to do
this mod  u /danielbaldielocks made a post in r/minnesotar4r  saying that the sub needed new management because he was going away which seems normal enough but it was the language he used that made me concerned.  i'm quitting life, therefore i can no longer own this subreddit.  so i decided to go through his post history and it's filled with posts about serious depression, quitting his job in the near future, mentioning that he was a veteran, saying that he had no friends or loved ones, and talking about how the va failed to get him proper mental counseling. all of these seem like serious red flags. the veterans thing in particular because of the extremely high suicide rate among them. now i don't know this guy, never meet him so it feels like i'm stepping over a line but god danm it am i supposed to just let the dude die? i mean what am i supposed to do about this?  i don't know if this is the right place for this but i don't know where else to put it.
i don't know if anybody cares but i've changed my mind... i'm not gonna commit suicide
instead i'm giving myself a few years... i'm not schizophrenic, yet... i'm gonna stay back another semester, go off to trucking school, become a truck driver for a few years and save as much as possible... if i don't get schizophrenia, i'm going to university and bettering my life. if i do get schizophrenia, well i'll have given life a real shot and i can give my family the money i saved. idk how many of you care but i thought i'd share this... 
):

i almost killed myself today.
i had so. many. pills in my hand. but i couldn’t. my dog, she came up to me and asked for pets, right as i was about to do it. i cried so hard. i love her so, so much. cherish your pets. they need you more than you know. 
today is my birthday
its 2 am in ny.  i have turned 34.  i have probably written 100+ posts to submit to this reddit.  and every time i go to submit my goodbye i end up over editing it...to the part where i feel better and simply copy/paste/save to my notepad.  i can't tell you how bad i've felt and how many different ways i've thought of leaving.  but i've been there.  will still be there.  and i'm here because of this thread.  bless everyone (lower case bless bc i dont care what religion or no religion).  growing old is a blessing denied to many.  and i'll probably wake up obsessed with ending it because of my situation but i'll log in - check this thread.  and hold on.  always hold on.  if you let go - that's it.  if you don't - who knows?  i'll take who knows all day.  thank you all.  cheers.
the fact that suicide has become an option freaks me out. i have to consciously decide not to kill myself every single day.
it's just so fucked up. i never even thought about suicide before, but now it's something i have to talk myself out of on an hourly basis. it's like my mind has become obsessed with it. i'm so overwhelmed by how close i was to having a decent life but i've completely fucked it up and now i'm so paralyzed by regret that every time i look back these passive thoughts become more active and it's just so hard to move forward.
i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. goodbye.

my cat saved me from dying last night.
i'll keep this short and sweet as only just got home from hospital. i finally thought i had a shot of happiness but it like it always does shit goes badly wrong in seconds. so i took my tablets drank the booze and did what i had to do. that's the last i remember until my cat dug her claws into me so hard the shock bought me around. i needed help and went to the emergency room. after hours of tests i was sent home and now i'm sat here thinking of doing it again. but making sure my cat is with someone who will look after her. i can't go on anymore but i refuse to go on a hold. i have no one to talk to. people make me think i can talk to them or trust the. throw it in my face. so basically my cat saved my life....i love her and resent her at the same time. update hi all....so i wanted to update you. it's been a really bad week. but i have volunteered to be put on a 72 hour hold starting tomorrow. i'm shitting it, but i know that it will help me or at least point me down the right path. iv found a lovely lady to watch my cat for me for a few days. but i know she is who i will struggle with being away from. 
suicide hotline is a joke
i waited over half an hour to speak to someone online. i am autistic and have trouble speaking over the phone. after waiting a long long long time, it was finally my turn and clicked on the “start chat” button as it said, and to my shock it disconnects me and says “thanks for the chat, click here to start a new one.” i am livid and not to mention the duration i had to wait made me want to kill myself even more. i have been suffering bad depression and terrible ptsd. i’m finally getting to my last straw and to not be able to speak to a counselor online about it, i don’t know where to turn. 
anybody else’s past bother them so much it’s one of the reasons why thy want to die?

failed all my university classes. just want to commit suicide now
i just found out i failed all my university classes \(failed 5 classes total\).  this is my 3rd year in engineering. i fked up big time and it's all my fault. you're welcome to tell me how much i fucked up in the comments, but it's honestly not what i need right now. i need some help to recover from this. i've been suffering from depression for 2 years now, but this semester got extremely severe. i was too embarrassed to go seek therapy, but i finally had the courage to and decided to go get help 1 week before my exam \(my fault again \- i wish i had the courage to seek help sooner, but i fucked up and was too scared to go\). it was only an assessment appointment \(so it didn't really help\), so im now put on the waiting list for 1 month now to see a therapist. i can't afford private therapy at the moment. my reasons for failing each class is due to my depression and also for the fact that i absolutely hate what im studying in university, and being forced to by my parents. each exam i took, my anxiety was unbearable and i just wanted to commit suicide by stabbing myself in the neck with a pencil during each exam, so the only want to cope with it was to just close my eyes during the exam \(hence why i got a 0 or like 10&#37; on each one\). i am going to be given a letter from the school saying that i will be kicked out if i dont get a 2.0 gpa next semester. i  really fucked up my life and there seems to be no point in living even now. i've been wanting to commit suicide seriously for the last month or so, but after failing everything it may be the last push i need for it. is there any hope? i feel so hopeless right now.
girl asked me if i was depressed
a girl in my class, don't know her very well and i'm not sure about her at all. just randomly asked if i was depressed. i was taken back from the question, i said no. but anyone could tell from my hesitation that i was. gonna be a shock when she hears of my death, huh?
putting the razors back was the hardest thing i've done
this whole morning i've been thinking i'll go to the dollar store for new sharp razors, then cut deep enough to hit an artery. when i walked in, i saw my favorite snack: seaweed. realized that it would make me happy, & that i don't deserve to be happy, especially with how much i'm going to hurt everyone when they find me dead.so i grabbed the razors and went to checkout. at the checkout stand was another package of seaweed. i switched the razors for seaweed. but told myself i can come back for them later. i really want to go back already.
after posting and reading this sub today, i genuinely don't feel like killing myself.
i guess just knowing there are other people who have suicidal thoughts constantly is magically making me feel less suicidal myself. interesting. 
i'm gonna call the local crisis line to be admitted. wish me luck (and strength to even call, tbh). i'm fucking scared.
so for one, i'm terrified of phone calls. so this is....really scary. two, i'm scared of being trapped. i hate being trapped. and if i sign in i might not be allowed to sign out bc of how bad i am feeling rn (i'm gonna be honest with them). three, i'm super duper addicted to nicotine and if i'm not allowed smoke breaks or nicotine patches or something i'm gonna lose my damn mind.        i'm really scared you guys. i tried to kill myself last night. i'm alive now. i regret not dying. but something is telling me to stay. it's not much but it's something. i just want someone to be proud of me. please.
may 1st i attempted suicide, was in the hospital for 21 days, supposed to be brain dead and i'm out and functioning and i'm doing better. i'm seeing a dbt therapist and actually taking some steps to try to get better instead of wanting to be miserable.

i'm killing myself tonight.
it's my twentieth birthday and i'm going to kill myself. i wasn't sure until an hour or two ago, but i'm sure now. i've already said goodbye to my sister, although she doesn't understand yet, and there's no one left to say goodbye to. i always planned to kill myself on my twentieth birthday, from the time i was little. i haven't written a note, but that's fine, i don't need to. i wish i'd had time to buy some books i wanted to give to some people, but i have around $600 in my bank account--maybe i'll taxi to the bookstore, buy the books, label who they're for, and then die in a couple of hours. i wasn't crying before, i felt calm, but i can't stop crying now, because i went onto the online crisis chat page, but it's only open wednesday through sunday, and i just thought, but that's too *late.* i called my only friend to ask if she wanted to go shopping, but she didn't pick up the phone, and there's no one left to save me. i'm going to die, tonight, and they'll find my corpse in a day or two. i wish i could wait until tomorrow and see what happens, but there's no time, i have to do it tonight.
it's just so funny
i can post on r/depression and get no responses, no upvotes at all, but plenty of views. i post here, saying i'm gonna end it all, and all of a sudden there's an outpouring of support and people telling me to contact them if i need to, saying i need to reach out and get help, etc etc etc. and it's the same shit offline, too. you tell someone you're depressed and sad, and it's like 'yeah okay but when are you *not*?', but as soon as you say you wanna kill yourself people suddenly care. it's all for selfish reasons, too. no one wants to be the one who ignored a suicidal person, but it's fine to brush off someone before they get to that point. like. yall do realize that feeling alone and helpless is what pushes people to that point, right?
offing yourself isn't that easy
planning to off yourself is annoyingly intricate. you have to figure out where and how and when. where can you go that no one you care about will find you, but someone else will. how are you going to do it? you've google searched least painful ways but where will you get the supplies and how will you keep anyone from finding out? the most complicated piece to me is when. should you do it before or after your family vacation? you wouldn't want to ruin it for everyone, but it seems phony to go along. do you have enough money saved up so your husband can still pay the rent for a while? you did just sign a new lease last month. do you have time to touch base with the people you'll miss the most and let them know how special and important they are to you. should you write a note? if it doesn't work are you prepared to live on under worried, watchful eyes and heavy prescription that makes you feel even emptier than you already are? you don't know how people can just pick a day and step off the side of a bridge.you keep telling yourself, next week is the week. no more procrastinating. it's not rocket science. in the end you'll probably just postpone it a little longer. not because you're afraid to do it, you're not. you're just to afraid to leave any burden on all the hearts left behind. 
saved from bridge
i tried to jump off a bridge yesterday. i've been battling with mental illness for a long time, and i actually had some months where i actually was feeling very good. but out of the blue my suicide/self harm thoughts began to come back. it feel like i'm in an argument with myself all the time, whether i should do something bad to myself or not.yesterday i couldn't handle it. so i went out to a bridge next to a forest, over a canal close to where i live. i stood on the outside of the fence for some time, not sure of what to do. then to young men walking by stopped and asked me how i was feeling, and i started hyperventilating and nearly crying. i told them i just wanted some time alone, and they walked down the bridge. at that time i was really cold and wet, because it was dark and raining. then suddenly a police officer showed up and started talking to me. i told him to go away because i really didn't wanted to talk. he suddenly began to walk closer to me, and i tried to climb further away from him, and just as i let go of the fence, he grabbed me. more police came and they dragged me over to the other side. i am now at the hospital.i'm feeling very down, and don't know what to do, because i know that when i get out of here again, i'm going to try again, not because i want to die, but because i need a break from my thoughts.i just needed to vent my thoughts.thank you for listening.
mental health professionals are fucking useless
seriously, what the fuck do they think will happen? psychiatrists don't give a shit about anything. psychologists exclusively tell me things i already know while charging a lot of money. therapists start making ridiculous assumptions and probably project their own experiences. nothing of what they say reaches me or speaks to me. then they go quiet. two have even suggested that i should take illicit substances. nothing they do changes the fact that life sucks. i wanted to give them a chance but in the end we're all alone.
suicidal ideation is stressing me out. i don’t want to kill myself but when i think about it it’s extensive and even relaxing. but then i just think about my family and i feel enormous guilt for fantasizing about it.

sorrry for asking this. but can someone just talk to me? i have no friends really. thanks.
edit: thanks everyone who replied or inboxed me. i never thought anyone actually would. i’m working through the comments now. so i’m not ignoring anyone. thanks. 
i just tried to kill myself
i stopped because, after five seconds of feeling floaty and feeling like my body was losing its strength, something inside me panicked and scrambled to untie the knot. i tried again after that but my brother came home because he forgot something and i had to untie myself again. started bawling after he got his thing and left. i couldn't try again after that. i was too numb and frazzled to stand up for a while. right now my throat kinda hurts in the way it would hurt after running a lot.i read a lot of stories where the person trying to kill themselves realized that they didn't actually want to die and were just trying to call out for help. i don't feel that way at all. i still want to die. but now i'm scared to try again.(sorry if this was too explicit, i'm new to reddit. feel free to delete or tell me to delete this post if it is too explicit)
i believe that most people who are actually serious enough to go through with suicide rarely say anything to anyone about it
i know this will likely be controversial but it seems to me that people who are actually committed to ending their lives keep it to themselves because telling others just invites the inevitable efforts to talk you out of it. most people already know this so clearly they actually don't really want to do it but are reaching out for help and for someone to talk them out of it. that goes for people who who post on online like this sub. what's the point of talking about it if you really want to go?  what is your opinion on this?
if you stood in front of me today.. 
if you stood in front of me today,you'd laugh and say that you're okay.everyone else would nod and smile,because today you're fine for a while.but today for the very first time,i would see the traces of your tears,and the shadows of all your darkest fears.i would realize how lonely you are..that every single day has left a scar.you would tell me that your suffocating inside,how there's not a single place you could possibly hide.i would tell you while looking deeply in your eyes:you're invaluable and worthy of everything.that no matter how much you may pretend,it's the real you that prevails in the end.if you stood in front of me today,i'd see the bruises on your neck,and the signs that you're in pain.i would see the shackles on your feet,that you're forced to fight and can't retreat.i would tell you that you're perfect they way you are.that no matter what you have always been a star.even if you think otherwise you are special to the core.and that everyone at some point can't get to shore.but the shore will come and everything will be okay.then maybe you would really be here today..that's my thought i replay in every possible way.you would be alive and standing in front of me,you'd be happy the way you deserved to be.i would tell you while looking deeply in your eyes: you're invaluable to me, to this world, and you're worthy. worthy of everything good in life. this ocean you feel that you are on may seem big, scary, lonely and endless but it's not. everyone at some point traverse this ocean and feel like they can't get back to shore but the shore always comes eventually and with it, the sunny beaches filled with calming and comforting love from the inside of yourself to others. everything will be okay. you're not alone. not alone in any sense. not alone on the ocean and you're not the first or the last to float through these waves on your raft. big storms or impossibly silent nights are just what comes before the paradise that peaks over the horizon and you will make it to shore. one day at a time. time and sunlight will heal these wounds and fade away the shadows of your mind to open up the warmth you have instead. this will in return make you meet others with this warmth. everything is okay, and soon you're going to feel it too, feel how it's even better than okay, i promise. i love you.❤️
i'm getting discharged on november 11 :d
i'm much better now, i went to therapy and got put on medications. i don't have any more hallucinations. self-harm thoughts. suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, no more depression, i eat normally, i sleep normally, i'm happy and i'm just doing great. it's been a hard year for me, especially being so young without the services to help me cope and get better. just know, there is hope, no matter what you're going through. i was in the darkest place and had no hope to get out and look where i am now :) don't give up. i truly believe in you :d
i regret not commiting suicide last month. now i'm going to commit suicide on my birthday.
i don't want to type out my story again but i gave myself a month long countdown to killing myself. now on my birthday next month i'm going to end my life.after i didn't go through with my plan i met a girl and we hit it off then suddenly her family decided to move south for whatever reason. thanks.on top of that i went to a dentist today because of wisdom teeth coming in. not only have they caused a cavity but it gave me an infection and  can cause permanent damage to my mouth. also i can't afford the $5000 bill. so i'm fucked. i love america (obvious sarcasm)well fuck it next month i'm just gonna be a bloody corpse with blood and brain matter leaking on the floor.i feel like when i do this i'll be taking everything back.
does anyone else speculate how people will react if you kill yourself?
i'm occasionally thinking that certain people will laugh or find it funny. it's dumb, i'll be dead i won't see there reactions..
i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at age 9.
i remember coming home from school, wrapping myself in blankets after i'd shut off all the lights, and crying. my mother would ask me what's wrong and all i could tell her was i don't want to be here anymore.i'm 23 now and the only change that's occurred in my life is that of increasing societal pressure and financial stagnation. i do my best to go out when i'm not working, going to the beach or hiking an adirondack high peak. even the sun on my skin has faded into a numb pleasure, overshadowed by the ever present despair in my mind. over the past few months i spent a lot of time creating projects and blogs in an attempt to create financial freedom, believing that maybe if i could work less i'd be happy more. nothing is working and nothing feels good. no matter how motivated i seem or the course of action i take, i feel as if it's all just the same act under a different mask. mentally i'm screaming like the agonized souls claimed by lucifer himself. physically, my mouth just gently forces itself into a crescent shape. i'm tired of feeling foreign in my own body, alienated to the existence around me. mostly i'm tired. i don't know how to be happy when it seems opportunity has fled the premesis. maybe i can rest soon. at least there is hope in the idea of rest.
goodbye r/suicidewatch (not what you think)
like many of you i have been circling the proverbial drain for awhile in a state of constant self loathing, suicidal thoughts, and idealization. i've been active on this sub and may others that are long since banned on various accounts for the last couple of years since i had a mental breakdown, quit my job, and maxed out my credit cards. but i have decided i'm going to give this life thing one more legitimate chance and in order to do so i am going to stop actively participating in this sub and many similar subs/websites.i find while the support and knowledge you are not alone is great sometime i find that when i browse subs like these i have a unhealthy habit of reinforcing my negative mood and killing any motivation.so i've come to say goodbye for me and my probably 20+ alts/throwaways over the years. hopefully i won't be back and if i am it is to provide support and understanding to those suffering.
depression is a blanket
depression feels like being under a blanket. it’s comfortable but stifling. it’s easy to give up because of that warmth and comfort. is it really so bad under there after all? eventually, lines become blurred for you. am i a lazy trash of a human being, or is my brain doing this to me? how can you even tell. focus on tasks becomes unclear. you begin to just sit for hours, staring at the wall and thinking about nothing and everything all at the same time. walking to the fridge for a drink becomes too much of a decision and an effort. you settle for nothing because moving to go anywhere but the bathroom or the bed feels like too much. you stop leaving the house but you’re not really sure why. it happens slowly. eventually you think of something you really love and want, something just right down the road, and decide it’s not worth it. maybe that’s when you realize what’s happening. the paranoia walks hand-in-hand with depression. they’re like best friends. it helps you stay under the blanket. it tells you that everyone and every thing outside of the blanket is out to get you, and because you’re comfortable under there, you decide to stay instead of get out and face it. believing the people you love most are working against you - behind your back. paranoia tells you that every word they speak about you to others is negative and mean... and true. this is only amplified when it regards someone who has betrayed your trust in the past. it makes it easier to listen to paranoia. it’s not far fetched, after all. friendships feel like an unworthy effort. why bother? when you believe those people think poorly of you anyways, is it really worth it to continue those relationships? friendships are supposed to feel like they are enriching our lives, but nothing feels enriching anymore so what’s the point? why spend the little energy you have fostering these relationships when you need that precious energy just to function for simple daily tasks. when you can’t even prioritize making and eating food over sitting on the couch in a daze, why would you bother with something like friendships?people aren’t sure how to react to depression. they ask the same menial question “are you ok?” out of a sense of obligation. depression makes people uncomfortable. you can’t actually see it. you can’t smell it or taste it or touch it or hear it. depression is only quantified when you’re standing in front of them, arms slit wide open, blood pouring out around you. or when they’ve found you a week after the last time someone heard from you, alone in your bed and dead. a quiet overdose. but it’s too late then. you see depression now only after that person decided to stay under the blanket forever. depression is self aware. you know there’s something wrong. if you’re not dead from it yet, there’s still an ounce somewhere inside of you that believes maybe you’re not the bad person - that has hope you’re not the trash of a human you believe yourself to be. so then what? “help” is expensive. if your finances are already in a precarious spot, how are you supposed to justify seeking “help”? and the definition of help for depression is fluid. the road to hell is paved with good intentions. medications come with their own list of additional problems. if it ends up not fixing the depression, you end up with it plus more. talking to someone... well, if you can’t even get the energy to eat, what makes anyone believe you’ll make the effort to speak to a stranger? a stranger who may show empathy, but whose only interest in your current situation comes lies in your wallet. and remember, you already don’t have money. so all of the effort and the energy you put aside to invest in “help” becomes trivial. intentions with a noble cause but a failure to execute. so you crawl back under your blanket. waiting. waiting for your life to crumble and fall around you so that you’ll finally have a reason to feel sad. your feelings will finally be justified. it’s not what you want, but you can’t do anything to stop it. and it will continue to get worse until that last ounce of hope has been drained from you. now, everything that has happened around you verifies you are, in fact, an awful trash of a human. and you decide to fall asleep forever under your blanket.
it’s frustrating when people think you can get better and that you’re not putting in enough effort to better yourself.
the predicament that i put myself in makes it impossible to get better.
it's frustrating to be so suicidal but so unmotivated i can't even kill myself.
hi, first post on reddit ever.i've been suicidal since sixth grade. i'm about to go to college now. and throughout these years i've made so many plans and preparations and half-hearted attempts but i've never actually managed to do what i want to do so badly.the problem is, the more i wait, the worse my life seems to get. i used to have two friends, and now i only have one after one of them dropped me after a stupid argument. i keep talking about killing myself and telling people i'm seriously considering it and nobody seems to care. i'm a homosexual, i've disappointed my family, my gpa just keeps getting lower, even my cat is avoiding me.i really want to do it. i won't even leave a note, because that'll slow me down. the problem is, i know i'll never manage to just do it, even though i'm so alone, and i want to do it so badly. 
i lied to my psychiatrist.
i tied the knot, stress-tested the doorknob and fitted the rope around my neck yesterday. i couldn't go through with it. i promised myself i'd tell my psychiatrist since i had an appointment with her the today. maybe she'd be able to help? i don't know what she could do anyway.. ask me politely me not to kill myself? have me locked up for a bit? i don't know what good that would do. i couldn't bring myself to tell her and instead told her how great i've been doing in my rehabilitation program. what a load of bullshit. i don't understand why i didn't reach out to her. she gave me another appointment in two months. i don't know if i'll even be alive in two months. if anything the urge is stronger today than it was yesterday. but fuck man i'll try to sleep on it for a bit longer i guess. maybe i'll tell one of my therapists next week.anyway thanks for reading my ramblings.
if it wasn't for music i would of killed myself by now.
i've always been described as someone with potential. and potential is all it was. i've been good at things, and just dropped them. i feel hopeless sometimes, a failure. i've never had someone on the regular around to talk to, or a hand to hold. i don't have anything in common with my parents, and i won't talk to them. i feel like my friends are fake. don't even bother asking me if i've had a girlfriend.music is the only reason i'm here. if you know, or have felt that wow, life is incredible feeling, nothing else gives me it. whether i'm at home, lying on my bed, listening to my absolute favourite album of all time shutting out the rest of my surroundings (porter robinson's worlds) or at the front row at a concert in absolute euphoria, it always seems to pull me from the pain.can anyone relate?
i think i've lost someone...
a few months ago i saw a post in this sub from someone who was ready to end it all after having lost interest in music. i tried to console this person by talking about what they were going through and we kept talking in this post. eventually i pm'd this person to make sure they could still vent their frustration through me. we messaged once a day for a out a few weeks, i messaged this person after new year to wish them the best of luck and thankfully they replied.i too have been battling the urge of suicidal thoughts and this week has been really good for me. i managed to get my first date ever with a girl i very much liked, however, i made sure to message this user to see if their luck has turned around... i checked their history and found out that they haven't posted or commented on anything in a month... their last post was about suicide and i just feel broken...i met one of the loveliest individuals on this sub and it gave me hope that there are good people in this world... i'm not sure if they're gone but right now i feel nothing but sadness for this lovely individual.hope you're still with us
i dont plan on killing myself but anyone else have this feeling of just not belonging?
maybe its simply not belonging in what school youre in, not belonging in this house, living with these people, or even as far as not belonging on this earth. just really feeling out of place in the world. anyone else share this feeling?edit: holy shnazoly this blew up. just wanted to tell everyone that we all have a place we fit, and dont be afraid to talk to the mods or others on here. keep the great discussions going!
i pulled the trigger.
10 days ago i found out that the love of my life had been cheating on me. we've been together for nearly 10 years and he blames me for it. i lost it, i  kicked him out. i publicly posted to facebook a goodbye, i stole one of his guns and i stood in the bathtub with the shower curtain drawn (to cut down on the mess), i put the barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger. nothing. i double checked it was loaded. i don't know how i fucked it up. my brain wasn't thinking straight so i loaded the gun and the dog in my car and started to drive to my parents place. for some reason i felt i had to leave my dog with them before taking off to figure out how to fix the issue i had with the gun. when i arrived, they wouldn't let me leave. i should have known better. they held me there until the police arrived. i was arrested under the mental health act and taken to the hospital. i still don't know how i talked my way out of the hospital.  i guess i'm a good liar, makes sense since i have so many years of experience pretending to be okay. i'm home now with my boyfriend, we're pretending to be okay until we can get into counseling.  i don't think i will make it that long. i'm upset that the guns aren't in the house anymore, it means this is going to be a lot more painful than i had planned. i practiced strangling myself with my bathrobe belt attached to the bathroom doorknob last night. i almost passed out before i got it loose again which, would have been fine honestly. i'm planning on completing the act today/tonight.  it's the last day/night my bf and i have together before he's on the road again, i would like to try to have a good day with him before i leave for good. writing it out helps solidify it, i think. i don't cry when i think of it, i feel peaceful almost. i'm fucked up, have been for a very long time. people will get over this fairly quickly. i'm sorry for the immediate pain this may cause my family but, they'll all be okay in the end.
my mom tried to kill herself again!!
i am so sick of everything, i wanna die!!!i hate everybody. i hate me!
i get a strange sense of euphoria when i start thinking seriously about committing suicide.
i have dealt with suicidal thoughts on and off since before i was a teenager with a couple of failed attempts. i'm 27 now and i have been doing so well lately, but i have been feeling myself fall back into my old habits of wanting to be dead. i hope i pull through this time too, but it is always hard to tell. i noticed myself losing interest in my studies and avoiding people. this is fairly normal behavior for me when i start to descend into depression. now the fake memories are back. i don't know if i'm strong enough to make it this time. i thought i had found the cure for my depression when i started hrt. but now it is back. i have this deep overwhelming desire to start transitioning socially, but i cant do that. i just cant. i thought if i could just use hrt as a way to make dysphoria a little less dangerous i could do this life, but i can't. i'm not going to give up. i'm going to try and fight this urge. i don't know though. it will probably depend on how long this 'rut' i guess last for.
anyone else sleep off their suicidal thoughts?
i do this most of the time. it’s not like i can take a magic pill and make them disappear so might as well just sleep it off
voluntary euthanasia
i wish society had a voluntary euthanasia program for anyone seeking to end their lives. without this option, people have no choice except to suffer indefinitely or resort to unreliable and painful suicide methods.society facilitates to end the lives of suffering animals with kindness. please can we have provision for those people who would like to end their lives with minimal trauma or suffering to themselves and others?
why does suicide just feel right?
when i think rationally i can easily tell myself that this shit isn't worth killing myself over but no matter how many reasons not to do it i bring there is still that one part of my brain that just makes me feel like i should. this is not just with suicide but with other things aswell. does anyone else have this? i just want to actually listen to my own rational advice.
lost my virginity to a sex worker at 25 and i’ve never felt more worthless and suicidal
feels pathetic. idk what to do anymore. i thought losing weight would make me happy and 145lbs later it didn’t. i thought looking better would make me happy. it didn’t. i thought dating girls would make me happy. it didn’t. i thought sex would make me happy. and i honestly feel worse.  i grew up in an abusive environment and basically didn’t interact with people my age until i was 20 and in college. so at this point i don’t think i’ll ever have social skills or a normal life. i’d cry if i had anyone to cry to.
i discovered my fiancé’s dead body one week ago
i had gone to take a nap while he finished up some work from home. he died of a massive stroke while i was sleeping. he was my world. we were moving forward in our relationship and had found solutions to issues we were having. we were so in love, that sickeningly cute couple still giddy after two years. and then it all came crashing down and keeps getting worse. as if the grief of finding the love of my life dead with no warning wasn’t enough, i’m on disability and suddenly it’s starting to look like i need to find somewhere to live. his friends and family all said nice things about how i will always be family and part of the group, but their actions say otherwise. i feel like i’m being phased out before i even have time to clear my head. my disability checks are $664 per month. not nearly enough to live on, especially in california. and i think i’ll be forced out soon, because technically his parents own the place and that has already come up a few times in conversation. everyone is just taking things of his without checking with me. so i’m sitting here, having the occasional heart palpitations and hoping my heart just stops so i can join him in death. even if there’s nothing on the other side, it’s better than this. 
my boyfriend posted here last night and now he’s in the hospital
he posted here and said “how can i kill myself relatively quick and without  bringing attention to it. i was thinking pills” and someone commented saying he wasn’t allowed to say stuff like that. this was last nightthis morning he tried to hang himself in the woods and it’s a long story and you can look at my last post on my account if you want to know what happened, but now he’s in the hospital. i’m the one who told his parents and told my teacher and i feel so bad because he trusted me enough to tell me that he was about to do it and i begged him not do i really did but he wasn’t listening. has anyone else gone through something like this where their s/o tried to kill them self? i’m feeling all sorts of things. everyone is saying that i saves him but now i feel like i don’t deserve to be forgiven. i just wanted him to be safe. he was going to kill himself. and i didn’t see that he posted here until just now. if only i had seen it a little earlier. i will never forget that i missed something so important. 
i wish life had a logout option
i want to just be able to say i'm done, i want to quit now and disappear.i'm so tired of being here.
fuck the holidays.
i barely have the energy to goddamn shower most days and now i’m supposed to be all happy and cheerful and joyousfuck that noise and fuck the holidays this extra responsibility just because it’s some special fucking day makes me want to crawl back in bed and fake a stomach virus. god i hate being alive.
since no one will tell me, i figured id make a list of things i wish i would have heard, it might save someone else...
you are not replaceableyou matter to me,any sort of complement at all, really.i can tell you've been working hard to improve, and i'm impressed,i dont want you to go.is there anything i could do to change your mind?you are committed, and passionate, and i admire thatyou have come so far the past two yearsim glad you took that trip, you came back a better person.will you marry me?i can tell you are hurting, and i want to helpi want to be with youi want you backyou are a huge contribution to the workplace...you were invaluable, and we regret not taking better care of youi look up to youwhat i get that doesnt help at all:think of the burdens you will leave behind for your loved onesits selfishsuicide isnt the answeryou have so much to look forward toeveryone struggles with these feelingsyou shouldn't feel that way.most of all, the thing i loath hearing? just do what makes you happy. edit: a kind anonymous stranger has chosen to guild me... thank them for me, i needed an award, but dont feel deserving. now i *really* cant delete this. fuckkkkk.
just talked to someone on a suicide helpline online.
all the did was ask “are you in immediate danger?” i said no and they said if it gets worse call a hospital and then disconnected. i was stunned.i just wanted to talk to someone.. i’m feeling incredibly isolated and scared and just to have them disconnect like that... it just hurt... i feel like cattle. that i’m not a person but a burden.
crying and feeling sad is better than feeling nothing at all
crying and feeling sad is better than feeling nothing at all, im on fuckin autopilot doing the same shit everyday and feeling empty
even buying a fucking meal stress me out! how have i not been eliminated by the nature or society already!?
just now i was waiting for my take-out and there were two other customers around me. just two! and it was enough to freak the fuck out of me and i had a strong urge to rush into the middle of the street and have a bus smash me into pieces. how could this pathetic piece of shit be allowed to breathe on the surface of earth?
talking about your future while wanting to die
i just had a talk with my mum and my guidance teacher about my future and i was just kind of sitting there nodding like yeah i've got to pass exams and stuff but on the inside i'm more like god i'm just gonna kill myself so don't even bother
anyone else only being held back because they don't want to fuck up their family members?
they wouldn't get it if i ended my life, and i don't think i could do that to them. i wouldn't be able to live with myself lol

id rather be happy than dead, but at this point i would rather be dead than unhappy every day for the rest of my life.
if i could magically snap my fingers and obtain friends,an so, and money i would never think about suicide again. i don't have clinical depression. there is no chemical reason for me to be depressed or for me to want death. its just my fucking life and the incredible pain it brings me. all i want is to be special or important to someone. i get why im not. im not a very nice person, nor am i a very interesting person, nor am i at all attractive. but it still hurts to be so alone, even if i understand the reason for it.
does anybody else feel like if they had a gun readily available they would have killed themselves already?
i'm not even really depressed, i just get stressed out sometimes. i feel like if all it took to end it was to open a drawer and pull the trigger, i totally wouldn't have held out this long. other methods require courage, pain, or planning, all of which can be dissuading or give you time to realize that it isn't worth it. does anybody else feel like this?
does anyone else feel like they're destined to commit suicide?
i don't want to kill myself now. but i fight off suicidal thoughts every day. everything seems so lonely, boring, hopeless and like nothing in my life is leading anywhere. i feel like i spend all of my energy caring for other people and their problems, but there's never anyone in my corner checking in on how i'm doing. right now i don't want to commit suicide because i can't do that to my parents. it would absolutely break them. but what's going to happen when they're gone? i feel like i'm going to hit a breaking point one day. i just have a hard time imagining myself dying of old age after a fulfilling life. no matter how hard i try to get better, i just feel like i'm destined to exit this world with a rope around my neck or with a bullet in my face. i'm not looking for sympathy or anything, i just want to know if i'm the only person who feels this way.
i want to go sleep and never wake up

people tell you to get “professional help” but forget that it’s too fucking expensive!!!
like seriously, it all looks like a scam. hard to find good ones which don’t cost a fortune!
the only reason i am alive is because i don’t own a gun.
i want to die, sometimes. i won’t do it any other way other than with a gun or assisted suicide because if i am going to do it, it is going to be final. i’ve read the stats.i’m too antisocial to find a gun on my own.canada has good gun laws. probably for the better. 
it tasted like shit.
first of all, sorry if my grammar or my choice of words irks anyone. i'm not a native english speaker. second, trigger warning for some sappy shit at the end. i'm just venting. so last year, on may, i tried to overdose and i gulped down all the pills i was able to find in the cupboard over my bathroom sink. i counted them. a total of 53. see, i don't know why i did it. well, yes. i do know. clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder and an untreated eating disorder. plus self harming and gender dysphoria, although i still didn't know how to name that bitch or even identify it. what i don't know is why i chose that precise moment, because i don't recall any particular trigger for it. i was getting ready to hang out with my now ex boyfriend. it hadn't been a pleasant day, but not the worst either. then i lost it and started thrashing the whole bathroom for medication to shove in my mouth. when i was done i started to get dizzy very quickly. my vision went on and off and i got really, really scared. the bad kind of scared. i thought of my brothers finding my body (the youngest was 8 at the time). i thought of my boyfriend waiting for me for hours. i thought of my parents having to pick a casket. i bent over the toilet, jammed three fingers up my throat and threw up as much as i could. it tasted like shit. i've thrown up many disgusting things during my life: stale milk, oreos with tuna (it was a dare), some shitty popcorn-flavoured shot that a bartender gave us to try... this was by far the worst taste, chemicals and stomach acid and blood because when i said that i jammed my fingers into my throat i mean jammed them. full blown metaphorical punch to the uvula.then i wept for a long long time, and then i cleaned up, got dressed and went to the movies with my ex-boyfriend. nobody knew of this for months. i did not go to the hospital (although i probably should have because i was dizzy and high for days after that, and i really don't know what were most of the pills for) and my parents still have no clue anything happened that day. at the time it seemed to me like i had cowered just when things started to get real, and i hated myself for it. mind you, this doesn't mark any important turning point in my still ongoing recovery. it's just an anecdote. i was a fucked up mess for a long time after that. no miraculous epiphanies in this post. today is world suicide prevention day. i'm alive and kinda well, i'm out of the closet, i'm transitioning, i have a boyfriend and loving friends and a career to pursue and i'm not always happy; sometimes, it feels like my best course of action would be to lay on a ditch and wait for the vultures. but it's okay. i know the voice that keeps on telling me that i'm a failure and a fake, that nobody will ever love me once they've known me and that i'm guilty of other people's misery is lying. it doesn't even exist. it's nothing but the symptom of an illness. i'm doing my best. things really do change. 
goodbye everyone. i'm doing it now.
i tied a noose to the beautiful old oak tree in my isolated backyard. the tree i grew up playing in and around. the tree in which i was married under. &#x200b;i'm terrified and happy. &#x200b;i love you all.
26 year old burnout and have finally realized i am not cut out for life.
let's get this out of the way first: 26-year-old kissless friendless virgin who has never had a job and is still in college trying to get a bachelor's with a nearly unhirable 2.6 gpa, all paid out of my aging parents' dime. objectively a failure and a loser on every level. the only joy i get out of life is consuming passive media like games, tv and novels to vicariously escape into a world where my life isn't garbage. my plan was to coast to graduation and get a middling job, but i've finally come to realize that my entire approach to life was destined to fail from the very beginning. i'm a lazy piece of shit who never developed any work ethic and am reaping the consequences for that. i was bullied throughout my youth, sure, but i never took the extra step to actually improve myself and be the best i could be. i was content being a fatso without developing real hobbies, never leaving my room unless forced to do so, scared to talk to people. i am about to graduate and have spent these last 3 1/2 years on a college campus staying inside my dorm room not speaking to anyone while barely passing or failing my college classes. no one here even knows my name. now after reflecting on the few job interviews i have gotten, i have realized that the real world is designed to sift through the worthless riffraff like me. they want people who are passionate, who are motivated, who have vibrant, social personalities. me? i'm a walking husk who would burn out of any job i'd luck into getting just like i've burned out on everything else, because there is nothing in life i am looking forward to. not a soul cares i exist besides my parents, and deservedly so. i am a human being with not a single positive quality.my mother will be passing soon from terminal lung cancer and i will take my own life soon after she's gone. thanks for reading.
do you ever feel suicidal when you hear about a success story or when you see someone close to you achieve something?
it happens when they meet a similar goal that i want. the r/getmotivated thread also triggers these emotions. also, i could be completely normal and someone would bring up a hypothetical positive outcome in conversation, “hey man, you never know, but [blank] can happen!” and then i just feel anxious and i want to end it. i’m trying to recover, but those are serious triggers. i try to stay away from “feel good” content and just be “realistic” if you call it that.what are some methods to combat this (besides therapy and meds which i can’t afford or exercise which i do already)?
it's funny how you're not responsible for anyone else's happiness until suicide is in the picture...
...and then suddenly your life doesn't belong to you because ending it would make other people sad. as if they don't have the option to end their lives if it becomes unbearable. as if they aren't forcing us to take responsibility for their feelings. as if they aren't asking us to bear pain for their sake.
what the fuck is wrong with you people
people come here looking for help and you know what people respond in the comments after pouring their life out to strangers because they can't or wont to people in their life? they get comments like these;[neadien: your in college. get off your ass and go out and fuck a few sluts](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/1od6gm/im_holding_a_gun_and_trying_to_decide_if_i_want/ccqwfl1)[tonydigerolamo: i think you sound pretty determined to be miserable. you can't know unhappiness is inevitable to you. that's just a guess.](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/1obwoa/im_18_years_old_i_lost_not_in_imminent_danger/ccqmq6w)now, i'm not saying that you're all like that but there is a bit of prominence with these kinds of comments. you know what else is bullshit? that comments are crazy supportive and different if the person admits they are a [woman](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/1obvlw/i_cant_make_the_pain_stop/).you have no idea where these people are in their lives or what could push them over the edge. i read one comment saying how their parents would miss them. but the fact is you don't know if the person coming here for help told you everything, you don't really know anything about them. how do you know their parents aren't causing a bunch of their heart ache? did any of you (the ones i'm referring to anyways) even read the things posted under *resources* on the side bar? [this one in particular](http://www.reddit.com/r/swresources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/) it covers some of the things i just mentioned.you guys break some of the basic rules when talking to people that are possibly suicidal here. you don't know what will be their snapping point. read the stuff on the side bar and stop making people feel like shit when they come here for help.
i see all the sadness in here
...and all i can think is that it sounds like an upgrade to the sheer apathy i feel about everything. i just don't care about anything. i can easily (...probably) get work, but don't want to, i don't care about feeling good, or happy, or secure; i don't care about friends (though i have a couple that i haven't yet ghosted still), and i barely care about family.&#x200b;i don't get any of it.
took a drive tonight with no intention of coming back
everything really got to me. totaling up my bills for the month, credit card payments, sent me in a serious spiral of anxiety and depression and i had to bolt out the door to keep from cutting myself. cruising around and getting some fresh air usually helps push those thoughts away.tonight wasn't like that. i could barely hold the wheel straight, could barely see through the tears. the radio was completely silent too, i never drive without music. i was really planning on flooring my car into the first solid object i found out in the backroads of the country, away from anyone else. didn't even get out of town past the first roundabout though before i lost my power steering. had to park the thing up in a parking lot nearby and figure out what was going on, after breaking down even farther. i'll never forget you though brother. random guy just pulled up, asked me if i needed any help. checked my oil, coolant, did everything he could to the best of his ability. stayed around and smoked a cigarette with me once we got everything sorted too. i decided to just drive back home for some reason. i might not have fixed anything tonight, but im still here. one day at a time i guess. i hope your all feeling better today
i feel bad for my parents that i'm occasionally suicidal. today, my dad had to drive home from work and risk getting fired just to check on me for having suicidal tendencies. i dont know what to do with myself.
